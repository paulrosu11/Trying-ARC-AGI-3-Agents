        "Your hypotheses should be structured around **how this game could be played**. Consider these possibilities:\n"
        "- **Movement**: Is there a player character? What integer(s) represent it? Does it move via directional inputs (Up, Down, Left, Right)? Does it slide or move one step at a time?\n"

        "    - A precise, falsifiable prediction of the outcome. For example: \"If this hypothesis is true, taking `ACTION1` should cause the integer `6` at row `8`, column `5` to move to row `7`, column `5`.\"\n\n"

        "**Coordinate System (Indexing):** All grid coordinates are specified as `(row, column)`. The origin `(0, 0)` is the top-left corner of the matrix. Row numbers increase as you go down, and column numbers increase as you go to the right. Be precise when referencing locations.\n\n"
        "Treat any group of identical integers where members share an edge as a **single, continuous object**, regardless of its overall shape. This principle is inductive: if integer `A` touches an identical integer `B`, and `B` touches `C`, then `A`, `B`, and `C` are all part of the same object.\n\n"
        "Integers that appear rarely or only once are often **critical elements**. They might represent the player character, a key, an exit, or a special interactive object. Track their positions closely.\n\n"
        "Many games place important information like a **move counter** along the **edges of the game board**. Look for integers in these boundary areas that change consistently with each action you take.\n\n"
        "Try to identify integers that **never change**. These often represent the static parts of the game world, like permanent walls or the background.\n\n"
        "Look for **symmetry or repeating patterns**. Symmetrical layouts can reveal goals or paired objects. A break in a pattern is often a significant clue.\n\n"
        "The **player character** is often the element that moves most predictably in response to your commands. It might be a unique integer or a **distinct composite of several different integers** that move together as one.\n\n"
        "Watch for any group of integers that consistently **shrinks, grows, or changes color**. This could represent a resource you are consuming or collecting.\n\n"
        "Remember that the game is deterministic. If you find yourself in a **loop of states**, you must try a different action from one of the states in the cycle to break out and learn something new."
