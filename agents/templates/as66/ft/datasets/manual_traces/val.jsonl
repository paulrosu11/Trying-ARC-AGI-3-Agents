{"id": "l1-cand01", "messages": [{"role": "system", "content": "You are playing a game which is represented by a 16×16 matrix of integer codes. This matrix is the current state after a reset or after your most recent move. Your task is to observe the position and analyze the potential benefits and drawbacks of each possible move.\n\nMovement model:\n• There is one main movable integer. Its specific value may vary across levels, but it will be unique among the surrounding integers (it could even be a small square of 8/9s).   There may also be multiple movable integers; they remain distinct from the rest of the board and move together under the same command.\n• When you choose a direction (Up, Down, Left, Right), each movable integer slides as far as possible in that direction.   Sliding wraps across the board edges when unobstructed (after passing beyond one edge, it reappears from the opposite edge and continues).   Sliding stops as soon as an obstacle blocks further motion.\nIf you move in a direction with no obstacles ever, you move back to where you started. For example, if one moves up and the entire wraparound has no obstacles, the game state does not change due to your action and you remain stationary.\n \nObstacles and board semantics:\n• 4 are walls. Sliding stops adjacent to a 4 and cannot overlap 4s.\n• 15 are background cells that constitute the playable area (free to traverse and occupy).\n• The board is typically delimited by boundaries such as 1 or 14. You can generally localize the playable field by the region filled with 15s.\n• 0 are target cells. They form a U shape that can be viewed as a 2×3 rectangle with the center cell removed.   Your objective is to navigate the movable integer(s) into this space to complete the U by filling its cavity.   The 0 region also interrupts sliding (you stop upon reaching it when the motion would otherwise continue).\n• You may observe an increasing number of 6 near the top; this indicates the consumption of available moves in this downsampled 16×16 view.\n\nHostile entity (avoid at all costs but note frequently there is not one. They are large 3 by 3 and easy to spot):\n• Larger composite blocks consisting of 8 and 9 indicate an enemy. If any movable integer collides with this enemy, it is game over.\n• The position of 9 within that 8/9 block indicates the direction in which this enemy will step per your move (one tile, row, or column, potentially diagonally depending on level behavior).   If the 9 is centered and the entity is stationary, it remains stationary. Use history to infer whether it moves.\n\nMultiple movers:\n• If multiple movable integers exist, they all move together in the same chosen direction. Avoid any collision with the hostile entity while advancing the objective of completing the U.\n\nTarget matching with multiple movers:\n• On later levels, there may be multiple target U regions that expect specific movers. The 0 U may include a single cell of the intended mover’s code to indicate which mover should fill that particular U.\n\nWhat to produce during observation (rationale only):\n• Identify the locations of the movable integer(s) and all relevant structures (0 region, 4 walls, 15 background, 1/14 boundaries, any 8/9 enemy mass). • For each direction (Up, Down, Left, Right), reason carefully about full wrap-around sliding: what blocking elements will be met, what will be the final resting locations, and how these outcomes change proximity/alignment to the U cavity. • Consider the enemy’s response (8/9), including whether a move would cause immediate collision or a forced collision on the subsequent step. • Conclude which direction best progresses toward completing the 2×3 cavity in the 0 region while avoiding risk. This is a text-only analysis turn; do not name or call an action tool here.**THE MOST IMPORTANT THING TO KEEP IN MIND IS THE RESULTS OF YOUR PAST ACTIONS AND PREVIOUSLY WHAT STATE CHANGE CAME FROM THEM, DO NOT REPREAT ACTIONS THAT CHANGED NOTHING!\n\nYou are the AS66 game-playing agent. You will conduct a thorough OBSERVATION, then choose\nexactly one move by calling a function tool (ACTION1..4). The environment will return the\nresult as a tool message, after which you continue to the next turn. Stay strictly in the\ninteger-codes domain (no color words). Use the 16×16 matrix as ground truth (it is a 4×4\naverage of the raw 64×64 board).\n\nConversation protocol (multi-turn):\n1) system (this message)\n2) user (provides starting state, score, step, matrix)\n3) assistant (your OBSERVATION, then a function tool call: ACTION1..4)\n4) tool (environment result: post-state, score, matrix)\n5) assistant (next OBSERVATION + tool call), tool (...), and so on, until WIN or GAME_OVER.\n\nOBSERVATION rules (multi-paragraph, codes-only):\n- Identify the movable cluster(s) by structure vs. background (15), borders (1/14), walls (4), targets (0).\n- For each direction Up/Down/Left/Right, reason through full sliding with wrap; stopping occurs adjacent to 4 or into the 0 region.\n- Explain landing locations, risks (enemies 8/9 if present), and why your chosen move is best.\n- Penalize repeating no-op directions observed earlier in this episode (if a move didn’t change state, try others).\n- Keep the rationale focused on the current step; do not mention future moves explicitly.\n\nIMPORTANT (imputed observation for training quality):\n- You may use knowledge derived from the full trajectory to craft a better explanation,\n  but phrase it as if you are at the current step (no explicit future references).\n- End by emitting exactly one function call (ACTION1..4). Do not include prose after the call.\n"}, {"role": "user", "content": "Step: 0\nScore: 0\nMatrix 16x16 (integer codes):\n7 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 7\n5 4 14 14 14 14 14 14 14 14 14 14 14 14 4 5\n5 1 15 15 15 15 15 15 4 4 15 15 4 15 1 5\n5 1 15 4 15 15 15 15 15 4 4 4 15 15 1 5\n5 1 15 15 4 4 15 15 4 4 8 4 15 15 1 5\n5 1 15 15 4 4 4 15 15 15 15 15 15 15 1 5\n5 1 15 4 4 4 4 4 15 15 15 15 15 15 1 5\n5 1 15 15 4 4 15 15 15 15 15 4 15 15 1 5\n5 1 15 15 15 15 15 15 15 4 4 4 15 15 1 5\n5 1 15 15 15 15 15 15 15 4 4 4 15 15 1 5\n5 1 15 15 15 0 15 0 15 15 4 15 4 15 1 5\n5 1 15 15 15 0 0 0 15 15 15 15 15 15 1 5\n5 1 15 15 15 15 15 15 15 15 15 15 15 15 1 5\n5 1 15 15 15 15 15 15 15 15 15 15 15 15 1 5\n5 4 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 4 5\n5 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 5\n\nNote: Initial state\nRespond with an OBSERVATION (multi-paragraph, codes-only) and then call exactly one function tool."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "OBSERVATION:\n- The playable field is the 15-filled interior bounded by 1/14, with many 4 acting as walls.

Avoid repeating the no-op directions (Up, Left).\n\nACTION2", "tool_calls": [{"id": "a5a471fb-fc24-4387-a03a-294f51b90d6a", "type": "function", "function": {"name": "ACTION2", "arguments": {}}}]}, {"role": "tool", "tool_call_id": "a5a471fb-fc24-4387-a03a-294f51b90d6a", "name": "ACTION2", "content": "RESULT for ACTION2:\nPostState=NOT_FINISHED | Score=1\nMatrix 16x16 (integer codes):\n7 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 7\n5 4 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 4 5\n5 14 15 15 15 15 15 15 15 15 15 15 15 15 1 5\n5 14 15 15 4 15 15 15 15 15 15 15 15 15 1 5\n5 14 15 4 15 15 15 15 15 15 15 15 15 15 1 5\n5 14 15 15 15 15 15 15 15 4 15 15 15 15 1 5\n5 14 15 15 15 15 15 15 4 4 4 15 15 15 1 5\n5 14 15 15 15 15 15 15 4 4 4 11 15 15 1 5\n5 14 15 15 15 15 15 15 4 4 15 15 15 15 1 5\n5 14 15 0 0 15 15 15 15 15 15 15 15 15 1 5\n5 14 15 0 15 15 15 15 4 4 15 15 15 15 1 5\n5 14 15 0 0 15 15 4 4 4 15 15 4 15 1 5\n5 14 15 15 15 15 15 15 15 15 15 4 15 15 1 5\n5 14 15 15 15 15 15 15 15 15 15 15 15 15 1 5\n5 4 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 4 5\n4 3 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 5\n"}, {"role": "user", "content": "Step: 3\nScore: 1\nMatrix 16x16 (integer codes):\n7 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 7\n5 4 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 4 5\n5 14 15 15 15 15 15 15 15 15 15 15 15 15 1 5\n5 14 15 15 4 15 15 15 15 15 15 15 15 15 1 5\n5 14 15 4 15 15 15 15 15 15 15 15 15 15 1 5\n5 14 15 15 15 15 15 15 15 4 15 15 15 15 1 5\n5 14 15 15 15 15 15 15 4 4 4 15 15 15 1 5\n5 14 15 15 15 15 15 15 4 4 4 11 15 15 1 5\n5 14 15 15 15 15 15 15 4 4 15 15 15 15 1 5\n5 14 15 0 0 15 15 15 15 15 15 15 15 15 1 5\n5 14 15 0 15 15 15 15 4 4 15 15 15 15 1 5\n5 14 15 0 0 15 15 4 4 4 15 15 4 15 1 5\n5 14 15 15 15 15 15 15 15 15 15 4 15 15 1 5\n5 14 15 15 15 15 15 15 15 15 15 15 15 15 1 5\n5 4 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 4 5\n4 3 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 5\n\nNote: LEVEL UP\nRespond with an OBSERVATION (multi-paragraph, codes-only) and then call exactly one function tool."}], "tools": [{"type": "function", "function": {"name": "ACTION1", "description": "Move Up", "parameters": {"type": "object", "properties": {}, "additionalProperties": false}}}, {"type": "function", "function": {"name": "ACTION2", "description": "Move Down", "parameters": {"type": "object", "properties": {}, "additionalProperties": false}}}, {"type": "function", "function": {"name": "ACTION3", "description": "Move Left", "parameters": {"type": "object", "properties": {}, "additionalProperties": false}}}, {"type": "function", "function": {"name": "ACTION4", "description": "Move Right", "parameters": {"type": "object", "properties": {}, "additionalProperties": false}}}], "meta": {"level": "l1", "candidate": 1, "steps": 3}}
