The surrounding area shows a maze-like layout with dark gray walls forming corridors and light gray pathways connecting spaces. A white/blue patch that represents the key generator is gathered toward the center-left region of the view, framed by light gray paths, indicating a reachable route but not directly blocked by walls in the immediate vicinity. The exit/lock motif, shown as a white/blue pattern adjacent to darker/black areas, sits further toward the right edge of the view, suggesting the need to move through the maze to reach it after obtaining the key. Considering immediate surroundings, the most prudent next step is to begin moving left to edge closer to the central path toward the key generator while avoiding any walls that block straight left movement. This keeps the door toward the key within reach and sets up a route toward the exit once the key is acquired.\n\nRecommended directional intent: left (ACTION3)"

    "content": "NOT_FINISHED | Score: 0\n\nAnalysis:\nFrom the provided 64×64 image, the player appears as an orange tile atop a blue tile, positioned in the upper-right quadrant of the visible grid. Dark gray blocks form solid walls with light gray corridors weaving between them, indicating passable pathways around the immediate vicinity. A white/blue pattern that represents the key generator sits toward the center-left region of the view, enclosed by light gray paths, suggesting it is reachable but not yet collected. The exit/lock motif, shown as a white/blue pattern near a black area, lies further to the right edge, indicating that obtaining the key is a prerequisite to reaching the exit. Based on the immediate surroundings, the prudent next step is to move left to start closing in on the key generator, ensuring that we stay within the light-gray pathways and avoid any walls.\n\nRecommended directional intent: left (ACTION3)"
