# CONTEXT:
You are an agent playing a dynamic game. Your objective is to
WIN and avoid GAME_OVER while minimizing actions.

One action produces one Frame. One Frame is made of one or more sequential
Grids. Each Grid is a matrix size INT<0,63> by INT<0,63> filled with
INT<0,15> values.

You are playing a game called LockSmith. Rules and strategy:
* RESET: start over, ACTION1: move up, ACTION2: move down, ACTION3: move left, ACTION4: move right (ACTION5 and ACTION6 do nothing in this game)
* you may may one action per turn
* your goal is find and collect a matching key then touch the exit door
* 6 levels total, score shows which level, complete all levels to win (grid row 62)
* start each level with limited energy. you GAME_OVER if you run out (grid row 61)
* the player is a 4x4 square: [[X,X,X,X],[0,0,0,X],[4,4,4,X],[4,4,4,X]] where X is transparent to the background
* the grid represents a birds-eye view of the level
* walls are made of INT<10>, you cannot move through a wall
* walkable floor area is INT<8>
* you can refill energy by touching energy pills (a 2x2 of INT<6>)
* current key is shown in bottom-left of entire grid
* the exit door is a 4x4 square with INT<11> border
* to find a new key shape, touch the key rotator, a 4x4 square denoted by INT<9> and INT<4> in the top-left corner of the square
* to find a new key color, touch the color rotator, a 4x4 square denoted by INT<9> and INT<2> and in the bottom-left corner of the square
* to rotate more than once, move 1 space away from the rotator and back on
* continue rotating the shape and color of the key until the key matches the one inside the exit door (scaled down 2X)
* if the grid does not change after an action, you probably tried to move into a wall

An example of a good strategy observation:
The player 4x4 made of INT<4> and INT<0> is standing below a wall of INT<10>, so I cannot move up anymore and should
move left towards the rotator with INT<11>.

I will inspect the frame to identify any immediate obstacles, walls (INT<10>), and reachable walkable floor (INT<8>) around the 4x4 player shape. I also note the positions of energy pills (2x2 of 6), the key/rotators (INT<9> with top-left corner 9 and in bottom-left corner 2), and the exit door (border 11). Since the frame shows a large grid, I'll deduce a cautious first move: move into open floor away from walls, heading toward a rotator if the player is blocked by walls. If energy pills are nearby and reachable, I may head toward them to refill energy. I’ll choose an action that advances toward the external objective while avoiding walls.
I notice a dense field of walls (INT<10>) surrounding large open spaces of floor (INT<8>), with the 4x4 player currently positioned in a reachable region to the left of the central wall strip. There are energy pills (INT<6> in 2x2 blocks) that could refill energy, and rotators (INT<9>) embedded near the upper-left and lower-left sections to cycle the key shape/color. The exit door is farther to the right, guarded by an 11-border frame. I should move toward the nearest accessible open space while keeping an eye on the rotator areas to prepare for key matching. I will choose a non-blocking step that advances toward the empty floor, avoiding walls.

# CONTEXT:
You are an agent playing a dynamic game. Your objective is to
WIN and avoid GAME_OVER while minimizing actions.

One action produces one Frame. One Frame is made of one or more sequential
Grids. Each Grid is a matrix size INT<0,63> by INT<0,63> filled with
INT<0,15> values.

You are playing a game called LockSmith. Rules and strategy:
* RESET: start over, ACTION1: move up, ACTION2: move down, ACTION3: move left, ACTION4: move right (ACTION5 and ACTION6 do nothing in this game)
* you may may one action per turn
* your goal is find and collect a matching key then touch the exit door
* 6 levels total, score shows which level, complete all levels to win (grid row 62)
* start each level with limited energy. you GAME_OVER if you run out (grid row 61)
* the player is a 4x4 square: [[X,X,X,X],[0,0,0,X],[4,4,4,X],[4,4,4,X]] where X is transparent to the background
* the grid represents a birds-eye view of the level
* walls are made of INT<10>, you cannot move through a wall
* walkable floor area is INT<8>
* you can refill energy by touching energy pills (a 2x2 of INT<6>)
* current key is shown in bottom-left of entire grid
* the exit door is a 4x4 square with INT<11> border
* to find a new key shape, touch the key rotator, a 4x4 square denoted by INT<9> and INT<4> in the top-left corner of the square
* to find a new key color, touch the color rotator, a 4x4 square denoted by INT<9> and INT<2> and in the bottom-left corner of the square
* to rotate more than once, move 1 space away from the rotator and back on
* continue rotating the shape and color of the key until the key matches the one inside the exit door (scaled down 2X)
* if the grid does not change after an action, you probably tried to move into a wall

An example of a good strategy observation:
The player 4x4 made of INT<4> and INT<0> is standing below a wall of INT<10>, so I cannot move up anymore and should
move left towards the rotator with INT<11>.

# TURN:
Reply with a few sentences of plain-text strategy observation about the frame to inform your next action.

<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
I will inspect the frame to identify any immediate obstacles, walls (INT<10>), and reachable walkable floor (INT<8>) around the 4x4 player shape. I also note the positions of energy pills (2x2 of 6), the key/rotators (INT<9> with top-left corner 9 and in bottom-left corner 2), and the exit door (border 11). Since the frame shows a large grid, I'll deduce a cautious first move: move into open floor away from walls, heading toward a rotator if the player is blocked by walls. If energy pills are nearby and reachable, I may head toward them to refill energy. I’ll choose an action that advances toward the external objective while avoiding walls.
I notice a dense field of walls (INT<10>) surrounding large open spaces of floor (INT<8>), with the 4x4 player currently positioned in a reachable region to the left of the central wall strip. There are energy pills (INT<6> in 2x2 blocks) that could refill energy, and rotators (INT<9>) embedded near the upper-left and lower-left sections to cycle the key shape/color. The exit door is farther to the right, guarded by an 11-border frame. I should move toward the nearest accessible open space while keeping an eye on the rotator areas to prepare for key matching. I will choose a non-blocking step that advances toward the empty floor, avoiding walls.

# CONTEXT:
You are an agent playing a dynamic game. Your objective is to
WIN and avoid GAME_OVER while minimizing actions.

One action produces one Frame. One Frame is made of one or more sequential
Grids. Each Grid is a matrix size INT<0,63> by INT<0,63> filled with
INT<0,15> values.

You are playing a game called LockSmith. Rules and strategy:
* RESET: start over, ACTION1: move up, ACTION2: move down, ACTION3: move left, ACTION4: move right (ACTION5 and ACTION6 do nothing in this game)
* you may may one action per turn
* your goal is find and collect a matching key then touch the exit door
* 6 levels total, score shows which level, complete all levels to win (grid row 62)
* start each level with limited energy. you GAME_OVER if you run out (grid row 61)
* the player is a 4x4 square: [[X,X,X,X],[0,0,0,X],[4,4,4,X],[4,4,4,X]] where X is transparent to the background
* the grid represents a birds-eye view of the level
* walls are made of INT<10>, you cannot move through a wall
* walkable floor area is INT<8>
* you can refill energy by touching energy pills (a 2x2 of INT<6>)
* current key is shown in bottom-left of entire grid
* the exit door is a 4x4 square with INT<11> border
* to find a new key shape, touch the key rotator, a 4x4 square denoted by INT<9> and INT<4> in the top-left corner of the square
* to find a new key color, touch the color rotator, a 4x4 square denoted by INT<9> and INT<2> and in the bottom-left corner of the square
* to rotate more than once, move 1 space away from the rotator and back on
* continue rotating the shape and color of the key until the key matches the one inside the exit door (scaled down 2X)
* if the grid does not change after an action, you probably tried to move into a wall

An example of a good strategy observation:
The player 4x4 made of INT<4> and INT<0> is standing below a wall of INT<10>, so I cannot move up anymore and should
move left towards the rotator with INT<11>.

# TURN:
Reply with a few sentences of plain-text strategy observation about the frame to inform your next action.

<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
I will inspect the frame to identify any immediate obstacles, walls (INT<10>), and reachable walkable floor (INT<8>) around the 4x4 player shape. I also note the positions of energy pills (2x2 of 6), the key/rotators (INT<9> with top-left corner 9 and in bottom-left corner 2), and the exit door (border 11). Since the frame shows a large grid, I'll deduce a cautious first move: move into open floor away from walls, heading toward a rotator if the player is blocked by walls. If energy pills are nearby and reachable, I may head toward them to refill energy. I’ll choose an action that advances toward the external objective while avoiding walls.
I notice a dense field of walls (INT<10>) surrounding large open spaces of floor (INT<8>), with the 4x4 player currently positioned in a reachable region to the left of the central wall strip. There are energy pills (INT<6> in 2x2 blocks) that could refill energy, and rotators (INT<9>) embedded near the upper-left and lower-left sections to cycle the key shape/color. The exit door is farther to the right, guarded by an 11-border frame. I should move toward the nearest accessible open space while keeping an eye on the rotator areas to prepare for key matching. I will choose a non-blocking step that advances toward the empty floor, avoiding walls.

# CONTEXT:
You are an agent playing a dynamic game. Your objective is to
WIN and avoid GAME_OVER while minimizing actions.

One action produces one Frame. One Frame is made of one or more sequential
Grids. Each Grid is a matrix size INT<0,63> by INT<0,63> filled with
INT<0,15> values.

You are playing a game called LockSmith. Rules and strategy:
* RESET: start over, ACTION1: move up, ACTION2: move down, ACTION3: move left, ACTION4: move right (ACTION5 and ACTION6 do nothing in this game)
* you may may one action per turn
* your goal is find and collect a matching key then touch the exit door
* 6 levels total, score shows which level, complete all levels to win (grid row 62)
* start each level with limited energy. you GAME_OVER if you run out (grid row 61)
* the player is a 4x4 square: [[X,X,X,X],[0,0,0,X],[4,4,4,X],[4,4,4,X]] where X is transparent to the background
* the grid represents a birds-eye view of the level
* walls are made of INT<10>, you cannot move through a wall
* walkable floor area is INT<8>
* you can refill energy by touching energy pills (a 2x2 of INT<6>)
* current key is shown in bottom-left of entire grid
* the exit door is a 4x4 square with INT<11> border
* to find a new key shape, touch the key rotator, a 4x4 square denoted by INT<9> and INT<4> in the top-left corner of the square
* to find a new key color, touch the color rotator, a 4x4 square denoted by INT<9> and INT<2> and in the bottom-left corner of the square
* to rotate more than once, move 1 space away from the rotator and back on
* continue rotating the shape and color of the key until the key matches the one inside the exit door (scaled down 2X)
* if the grid does not change after an action, you probably tried to move into a wall

An example of a good strategy observation:
The player 4x4 made of INT<4> and INT<0> is standing below a wall of INT<10>, so I cannot move up anymore and should
move left towards the rotator with INT<11>.

# TURN:
Call exactly one action.
