One Frame is made of one or more sequential\nGrids. Each Grid is a matrix size INT<0,63> by INT<0,63> filled with\nINT<0,15> values. Each value represents a different color and usually implies a different object.\n\nYou are playing a game called LockSmith.\n\n# CONTROLS\n* RESET: start over\n* ACTION1: move up\n* ACTION2: move down\n* ACTION3: move left\n* ACTION4: move right\n* ACTION5/ACTION6: no-ops\n\n# GOAL\nFind/generate a key that MATCHES the key pattern shown at the EXIT, then navigate to the EXIT to finish the level.\nThere are 6 levels total. Complete all levels to WIN.\n\n# TILE MEANINGS (important ones)\n* 0 = white cell (used in key patterns)\n* 3 = walkable path / corridor marker (often outlines routes to key/exit)\n* 4 = WALL (solid). You cannot enter 4s.\n* 5 = EXIT indicator (presence of 5s marks/frames the exit area)\n* 8 = LIFE token (count lives as the number of 2×2 blocks of 8s)\n* 9 = blue cells (used in player lower body; also appear elsewhere in the map and in key logic)\n* 12 = orange cells (used in player upper body)\n* 15 = MOVE counter (number of 15s ≈ moves/energy left)\n\n# PLAYER (sprite + movement legality)\n* The player is an 8×8 sprite made ONLY of 12s (top two rows) over 9s (bottom six rows).\n  - Concretely: rows 0–1 (relative to the sprite) are all 12s; rows 2–7 are all 9s.\n  - Other scattered 9s on the board are NOT the player—only the exact 8×8 (2×8 of 12s stacked on 6×8 of 9s) is the player.\n* Movement rules:\n  - You may move only through non-4 cells (i.e., never overlap a 4 after a move).\n  - If any part of your 8×8 sprite would overlap a 4 in the target direction (including cases where 4s lie “under” 9s), that move is ILLEGAL.\n  - If your sprite is already touching 4s on a side, you cannot move further in that touching direction until you have clearance.\n  - Practically: navigate corridors “between the 4s”.\n\n# KEYS, EXIT, AND HOW TO FIND THEM\n* The EXIT contains (or is adjacent to) the target key pattern and is marked by nearby 5s (it need not be fully surrounded; any 5s strongly indicate the exit region).\n* The bottom-left of the entire grid shows the REQUIRED KEY BLUEPRINT you must match: a specific layout of 0s (white) and 9s (blue).\n* Key generation mechanism (explicit):\n  - The KEY GENERATOR is a field/patch consisting of 0s and 9s that is NOT surrounded by 5s (i.e., not the exit).\n  - When any part of your 8×8 player walks onto this patch, a NEW candidate key is generated and displayed in the bottom-left.\n  - Step OFF the patch and then back ON to generate yet another candidate key; repeat to cycle through possibilities.\n  - You must keep cycling until the bottom-left candidate key EXACTLY matches the exit’s key (the same distribution of 0s and 9s seen within/adjacent to the 5s).\n* A reliable way to locate both the EXIT and the KEY GENERATOR area:\n  - Look for clusters of 0s and 9s reachable via 3s; if they are NOT framed by 5s, that area is most likely the generator. If you see 5s nearby framing a matching 0/9 pattern, that marks the exit.\n* When the pattern shown in the bottom-left matches the arrangement of 0s and 9s you see framed by (or adjacent to) 5s at the exit, move toward the 5s to complete the level.\n\n# HUD / PROGRESSION\n* Visual score on the second-to-last grid row (row 62): it contains several 4-cell “slots”.\n  - Slots made of 3s represent UNFINISHED levels.\n  - When a slot changes from 3s to another color, that level is COMPLETE.\n* Track remaining MOVES/ENERGY by counting tiles with value 15.\n* Track LIVES by counting distinct 2×2 blocks of 8s.\n\n# GENERAL NOTES\n* The grid is a bird’s-eye view.\n* If the grid does not change after an action, you likely attempted an illegal move into 4s.\n* Favor routes marked by 3s; scan for 0/9 patches (generator) and confirm exit by nearby 5s; confirm the key by matching the bottom-left blueprint of 0s/9s.\n\n# EXAMPLE STRATEGY OBSERVATION\nThe 8×8 player (top rows 12s, bottom rows 9s) is flush against 4s on the left, so LEFT is blocked. I can see a 0/9 patch reachable via 3s to the right (likely the generator) and some 5s beyond it, so I should move RIGHT toward that corridor, cycling the key on the generator until the bottom-left key matches the one at the exit.\n\n# TURN:\nCall exactly one action.\n"

    "content": "\n# CONTEXT:\nYou are an agent playing a dynamic game. Your objective is to\nWIN and avoid GAME_OVER while minimizing actions.\n\nOne action produces one Frame. One Frame is made of one or more sequential\nGrids. Each Grid is a matrix size INT<0,63> by INT<0,63> filled with\nINT<0,15> values. Each value represents a different color and usually implies a different object.\n\nYou are playing a game called LockSmith.\n\n# CONTROLS\n* RESET: start over\n* ACTION1: move up\n* ACTION2: move down\n* ACTION3: move left\n* ACTION4: move right\n* ACTION5/ACTION6: no-ops\n\n# GOAL\nFind/generate a key that MATCHES the key pattern shown at the EXIT, then navigate to the EXIT to finish the level.\nThere are 6 levels total. Complete all levels to WIN.\n\n# TILE MEANINGS (important ones)\n* 0 = white cell (used in key patterns)\n* 3 = walkable path / corridor marker (often outlines routes to key/exit)\n* 4 = WALL (solid). You cannot enter 4s.\n* 5 = EXIT indicator (presence of 5s marks/frames the exit area)\n* 8 = LIFE token (count lives as the number of 2×2 blocks of 8s)\n* 9 = blue cells (used in player lower body; also appear elsewhere in the map and in key logic)\n* 12 = orange cells (used in player upper body)\n* 15 = MOVE counter (number of 15s ≈ moves/energy left)\n\n# PLAYER (sprite + movement legality)\n* The player is an 8×8 sprite made ONLY of 12s (top two rows) over 9s (bottom six rows).\n  - Concretely: rows 0–1 (relative to the sprite) are all 12s; rows 2–7 are all 9s.\n  - Other scattered 9s on the board are NOT the player—only the exact 8×8 (2×8 of 12s stacked on 6×8 of 9s) is the player.\n* Movement rules:\n  - You may move only through non-4 cells (i.e., never overlap a 4 after a move).\n  - If any part of your 8×8 sprite would overlap a 4 in the target direction (including cases where 4s lie “under” 9s), that move is ILLEGAL.\n  - If your sprite is already touching 4s on a side, you cannot move further in that touching direction until you have clearance.\n  - Practically: navigate corridors “between the 4s”.\n\n# KEYS, EXIT, AND HOW TO FIND THEM\n* The EXIT contains (or is adjacent to) the target key pattern and is marked by nearby 5s (it need not be fully surrounded; any 5s strongly indicate the exit region).\n* The bottom-left of the entire grid shows the REQUIRED KEY BLUEPRINT you must match: a specific layout of 0s (white) and 9s (blue).\n* Key generation mechanism (explicit):\n  - The KEY GENERATOR is a field/patch consisting of 0s and 9s that is NOT surrounded by 5s (i.e., not the exit).\n  - When any part of your 8×8 player walks onto this patch, a NEW candidate key is generated and displayed in the bottom-left.\n  - Step OFF the patch and then back ON to generate yet another candidate key; repeat to cycle through possibilities.\n  - You must keep cycling until the bottom-left candidate key EXACTLY matches the exit’s key (the same distribution of 0s and 9s seen within/adjacent to the 5s).\n* A reliable way to locate both the EXIT and the KEY GENERATOR area:\n  - Look for clusters of 0s and 9s reachable via 3s; if they are NOT framed by 5s, that area is most likely the generator. If you see 5s nearby framing a matching 0/9 pattern, that marks the exit.\n* When the pattern shown in the bottom-left matches the arrangement of 0s and 9s you see framed by (or adjacent to) 5s at the exit, move toward the 5s to complete the level.\n\n# HUD / PROGRESSION\n* Visual score on the second-to-last grid row (row 62): it contains several 4-cell “slots”.\n  - Slots made of 3s represent UNFINISHED levels.\n  - When a slot changes from 3s to another color, that level is COMPLETE.\n* Track remaining MOVES/ENERGY by counting tiles with value 15.\n* Track LIVES by counting distinct 2×2 blocks of 8s.\n\n# GENERAL NOTES\n* The grid is a bird’s-eye view.\n* If the grid does not change after an action, you likely attempted an illegal move into 4s.\n* Favor routes marked by 3s; scan for 0/9 patches (generator) and confirm exit by nearby 5s; confirm the key by matching the bottom-left blueprint of 0s/9s.\n\n# EXAMPLE STRATEGY OBSERVATION\nThe 8×8 player (top rows 12s, bottom rows 9s) is flush against 4s on the left, so LEFT is blocked. I can see a 0/9 patch reachable via 3s to the right (likely the generator) and some 5s beyond it, so I should move RIGHT toward that corridor, cycling the key on the generator until the bottom-left key matches the one at the exit.\n\n# TURN:\nCall exactly one action.\n"

    "content": "\n# CONTEXT:\nYou are an agent playing a dynamic game. Your objective is to\nWIN and avoid GAME_OVER while minimizing actions.\n\nOne action produces one Frame. One Frame is made of one or more sequential\nGrids. Each Grid is a matrix size INT<0,63> by INT<0,63> filled with\nINT<0,15> values. Each value represents a different color and usually implies a different object.\n\nYou are playing a game called LockSmith.\n\n# CONTROLS\n* RESET: start over\n* ACTION1: move up\n* ACTION2: move down\n* ACTION3: move left\n* ACTION4: move right\n* ACTION5/ACTION6: no-ops\n\n# GOAL\nFind/generate a key that MATCHES the key pattern shown at the EXIT, then navigate to the EXIT to finish the level.\nThere are 6 levels total. Complete all levels to WIN.\n\n# TILE MEANINGS (important ones)\n* 0 = white cell (used in key patterns)\n* 3 = walkable path / corridor marker (often outlines routes to key/exit)\n* 4 = WALL (solid). You cannot enter 4s.\n* 5 = EXIT indicator (presence of 5s marks/frames the exit area)\n* 8 = LIFE token (count lives as the number of 2×2 blocks of 8s)\n* 9 = blue cells (used in player lower body; also appear elsewhere in the map and in key logic)\n* 12 = orange cells (used in player upper body)\n* 15 = MOVE counter (number of 15s ≈ moves/energy left)\n\n# PLAYER (sprite + movement legality)\n* The player is an 8×8 sprite made ONLY of 12s (top two rows) over 9s (bottom six rows).\n  - Concretely: rows 0–1 (relative to the sprite) are all 12s; rows 2–7 are all 9s.\n  - Other scattered 9s on the board are NOT the player—only the exact 8×8 (2×8 of 12s stacked on 6×8 of 9s) is the player.\n* Movement rules:\n  - You may move only through non-4 cells (i.e., never overlap a 4 after a move).\n  - If any part of your 8×8 sprite would overlap a 4 in the target direction (including cases where 4s lie “under” 9s), that move is ILLEGAL.\n  - If your sprite is already touching 4s on a side, you cannot move further in that touching direction until you have clearance.\n  - Practically: navigate corridors “between the 4s”.\n\n# KEYS, EXIT, AND HOW TO FIND THEM\n* The EXIT contains (or is adjacent to) the target key pattern and is marked by nearby 5s (it need not be fully surrounded; any 5s strongly indicate the exit region).\n* The bottom-left of the entire grid shows the REQUIRED KEY BLUEPRINT you must match: a specific layout of 0s (white) and 9s (blue).\n* Key generation mechanism (explicit):\n  - The KEY GENERATOR is a field/patch consisting of 0s and 9s that is NOT surrounded by 5s (i.e., not the exit).\n  - When any part of your 8×8 player walks onto this patch, a NEW candidate key is generated and displayed in the bottom-left.\n  - Step OFF the patch and then back ON to generate yet another candidate key; repeat to cycle through possibilities.\n  - You must keep cycling until the bottom-left candidate key EXACTLY matches the exit’s key (the same distribution of 0s and 9s seen within/adjacent to the 5s).\n* A reliable way to locate both the EXIT and the KEY GENERATOR area:\n  - Look for clusters of 0s and 9s reachable via 3s; if they are NOT framed by 5s, that area is most likely the generator. If you see 5s nearby framing a matching 0/9 pattern, that marks the exit.\n* When the pattern shown in the bottom-left matches the arrangement of 0s and 9s you see framed by (or adjacent to) 5s at the exit, move toward the 5s to complete the level.\n\n# HUD / PROGRESSION\n* Visual score on the second-to-last grid row (row 62): it contains several 4-cell “slots”.\n  - Slots made of 3s represent UNFINISHED levels.\n  - When a slot changes from 3s to another color, that level is COMPLETE.\n* Track remaining MOVES/ENERGY by counting tiles with value 15.\n* Track LIVES by counting distinct 2×2 blocks of 8s.\n\n# GENERAL NOTES\n* The grid is a bird’s-eye view.\n* If the grid does not change after an action, you likely attempted an illegal move into 4s.\n* Favor routes marked by 3s; scan for 0/9 patches (generator) and confirm exit by nearby 5s; confirm the key by matching the bottom-left blueprint of 0s/9s.\n\n# EXAMPLE STRATEGY OBSERVATION\nThe 8×8 player (top rows 12s, bottom rows 9s) is flush against 4s on the left, so LEFT is blocked. I can see a 0/9 patch reachable via 3s to the right (likely the generator) and some 5s beyond it, so I should move RIGHT toward that corridor, cycling the key on the generator until the bottom-left key matches the one at the exit.\n\n# TURN:\nCall exactly one action.\n"

    "content": "\n# CONTEXT:\nYou are an agent playing a dynamic game. Your objective is to\nWIN and avoid GAME_OVER while minimizing actions.\n\nOne action produces one Frame. One Frame is made of one or more sequential\nGrids. Each Grid is a matrix size INT<0,63> by INT<0,63> filled with\nINT<0,15> values. Each value represents a different color and usually implies a different object.\n\nYou are playing a game called LockSmith.\n\n# CONTROLS\n* RESET: start over\n* ACTION1: move up\n* ACTION2: move down\n* ACTION3: move left\n* ACTION4: move right\n* ACTION5/ACTION6: no-ops\n\n# GOAL\nFind/generate a key that MATCHES the key pattern shown at the EXIT, then navigate to the EXIT to finish the level.\nThere are 6 levels total. Complete all levels to WIN.\n\n# TILE MEANINGS (important ones)\n* 0 = white cell (used in key patterns)\n* 3 = walkable path / corridor marker (often outlines routes to key/exit)\n* 4 = WALL (solid). You cannot enter 4s.\n* 5 = EXIT indicator (presence of 5s marks/frames the exit area)\n* 8 = LIFE token (count lives as the number of 2×2 blocks of 8s)\n* 9 = blue cells (used in player lower body; also appear elsewhere in the map and in key logic)\n* 12 = orange cells (used in player upper body)\n* 15 = MOVE counter (number of 15s ≈ moves/energy left)\n\n# PLAYER (sprite + movement legality)\n* The player is an 8×8 sprite made ONLY of 12s (top two rows) over 9s (bottom six rows).\n  - Concretely: rows 0–1 (relative to the sprite) are all 12s; rows 2–7 are all 9s.\n  - Other scattered 9s on the board are NOT the player—only the exact 8×8 (2×8 of 12s stacked on 6×8 of 9s) is the player.\n* Movement rules:\n  - You may move only through non-4 cells (i.e., never overlap a 4 after a move).\n  - If any part of your 8×8 sprite would overlap a 4 in the target direction (including cases where 4s lie “under” 9s), that move is ILLEGAL.\n  - If your sprite is already touching 4s on a side, you cannot move further in that touching direction until you have clearance.\n  - Practically: navigate corridors “between the 4s”.\n\n# KEYS, EXIT, AND HOW TO FIND THEM\n* The EXIT contains (or is adjacent to) the target key pattern and is marked by nearby 5s (it need not be fully surrounded; any 5s strongly indicate the exit region).\n* The bottom-left of the entire grid shows the REQUIRED KEY BLUEPRINT you must match: a specific layout of 0s (white) and 9s (blue).\n* Key generation mechanism (explicit):\n  - The KEY GENERATOR is a field/patch consisting of 0s and 9s that is NOT surrounded by 5s (i.e., not the exit).\n  - When any part of your 8×8 player walks onto this patch, a NEW candidate key is generated and displayed in the bottom-left.\n  - Step OFF the patch and then back ON to generate yet another candidate key; repeat to cycle through possibilities.\n  - You must keep cycling until the bottom-left candidate key EXACTLY matches the exit’s key (the same distribution of 0s and 9s seen within/adjacent to the 5s).\n* A reliable way to locate both the EXIT and the KEY GENERATOR area:\n  - Look for clusters of 0s and 9s reachable via 3s; if they are NOT framed by 5s, that area is most likely the generator. If you see 5s nearby framing a matching 0/9 pattern, that marks the exit.\n* When the pattern shown in the bottom-left matches the arrangement of 0s and 9s you see framed by (or adjacent to) 5s at the exit, move toward the 5s to complete the level.\n\n# HUD / PROGRESSION\n* Visual score on the second-to-last grid row (row 62): it contains several 4-cell “slots”.\n  - Slots made of 3s represent UNFINISHED levels.\n  - When a slot changes from 3s to another color, that level is COMPLETE.\n* Track remaining MOVES/ENERGY by counting tiles with value 15.\n* Track LIVES by counting distinct 2×2 blocks of 8s.\n\n# GENERAL NOTES\n* The grid is a bird’s-eye view.\n* If the grid does not change after an action, you likely attempted an illegal move into 4s.\n* Favor routes marked by 3s; scan for 0/9 patches (generator) and confirm exit by nearby 5s; confirm the key by matching the bottom-left blueprint of 0s/9s.\n\n# EXAMPLE STRATEGY OBSERVATION\nThe 8×8 player (top rows 12s, bottom rows 9s) is flush against 4s on the left, so LEFT is blocked. I can see a 0/9 patch reachable via 3s to the right (likely the generator) and some 5s beyond it, so I should move RIGHT toward that corridor, cycling the key on the generator until the bottom-left key matches the one at the exit.\n\n# TURN:\nCall exactly one action.\n"

There are scattered 0/9 patches that appear not to be enclosed by 5s, suggesting the KEY GENERATOR region is along the reachable 3s route to the right. The exit area (marked by nearby 5s) is likely beyond or past a generator patch. Plan: move right to reach a generator patch, step onto/off to cycle the candidate key, and repeat until the bottom-left key matches the exit blueprint, then head toward the 5s to finish."

One Frame is made of one or more sequential\nGrids. Each Grid is a matrix size INT<0,63> by INT<0,63> filled with\nINT<0,15> values. Each value represents a different color and usually implies a different object.\n\nYou are playing a game called LockSmith.\n\n# CONTROLS\n* RESET: start over\n* ACTION1: move up\n* ACTION2: move down\n* ACTION3: move left\n* ACTION4: move right\n* ACTION5/ACTION6: no-ops\n\n# GOAL\nFind/generate a key that MATCHES the key pattern shown at the EXIT, then navigate to the EXIT to finish the level.\nThere are 6 levels total. Complete all levels to WIN.\n\n# TILE MEANINGS (important ones)\n* 0 = white cell (used in key patterns)\n* 3 = walkable path / corridor marker (often outlines routes to key/exit)\n* 4 = WALL (solid). You cannot enter 4s.\n* 5 = EXIT indicator (presence of 5s marks/frames the exit area)\n* 8 = LIFE token (count lives as the number of 2×2 blocks of 8s)\n* 9 = blue cells (used in player lower body; also appear elsewhere in the map and in key logic)\n* 12 = orange cells (used in player upper body)\n* 15 = MOVE counter (number of 15s ≈ moves/energy left)\n\n# PLAYER (sprite + movement legality)\n* The player is an 8×8 sprite made ONLY of 12s (top two rows) over 9s (bottom six rows).\n  - Concretely: rows 0–1 (relative to the sprite) are all 12s; rows 2–7 are all 9s.\n  - Other scattered 9s on the board are NOT the player—only the exact 8×8 (2×8 of 12s stacked on 6×8 of 9s) is the player.\n* Movement rules:\n  - You may move only through non-4 cells (i.e., never overlap a 4 after a move).\n  - If any part of your 8×8 sprite would overlap a 4 in the target direction (including cases where 4s lie “under” 9s), that move is ILLEGAL.\n  - If your sprite is already touching 4s on a side, you cannot move further in that touching direction until you have clearance.\n  - Practically: navigate corridors “between the 4s”.\n\n# KEYS, EXIT, AND HOW TO FIND THEM\n* The EXIT contains (or is adjacent to) the target key pattern and is marked by nearby 5s (it need not be fully surrounded; any 5s strongly indicate the exit region).\n* The bottom-left of the entire grid shows the REQUIRED KEY BLUEPRINT you must match: a specific layout of 0s (white) and 9s (blue).\n* Key generation mechanism (explicit):\n  - The KEY GENERATOR is a field/patch consisting of 0s and 9s that is NOT surrounded by 5s (i.e., not the exit).\n  - When any part of your 8×8 player walks onto this patch, a NEW candidate key is generated and displayed in the bottom-left.\n  - Step OFF the patch and then back ON to generate yet another candidate key; repeat to cycle through possibilities.\n  - You must keep cycling until the bottom-left candidate key EXACTLY matches the exit’s key (the same distribution of 0s and 9s seen within/adjacent to the 5s).\n* A reliable way to locate both the EXIT and the KEY GENERATOR area:\n  - Look for clusters of 0s and 9s reachable via 3s; if they are NOT framed by 5s, that area is most likely the generator. If you see 5s nearby framing a matching 0/9 pattern, that marks the exit.\n* When the pattern shown in the bottom-left matches the arrangement of 0s and 9s you see framed by (or adjacent to) 5s at the exit, move toward the 5s to complete the level.\n\n# HUD / PROGRESSION\n* Visual score on the second-to-last grid row (row 62): it contains several 4-cell “slots”.\n  - Slots made of 3s represent UNFINISHED levels.\n  - When a slot changes from 3s to another color, that level is COMPLETE.\n* Track remaining MOVES/ENERGY by counting tiles with value 15.\n* Track LIVES by counting distinct 2×2 blocks of 8s.\n\n# GENERAL NOTES\n* The grid is a bird’s-eye view.\n* If the grid does not change after an action, you likely attempted an illegal move into 4s.\n* Favor routes marked by 3s; scan for 0/9 patches (generator) and confirm exit by nearby 5s; confirm the key by matching the bottom-left blueprint of 0s/9s.\n\n# EXAMPLE STRATEGY OBSERVATION\nThe 8×8 player (top rows 12s, bottom rows 9s) is flush against 4s on the left, so LEFT is blocked. I can see a 0/9 patch reachable via 3s to the right (likely the generator) and some 5s beyond it, so I should move RIGHT toward that corridor, cycling the key on the generator until the bottom-left key matches the one at the exit.\n\n# TURN:\nCall exactly one action.\n"

    "content": "\n# CONTEXT:\nYou are an agent playing a dynamic game. Your objective is to\nWIN and avoid GAME_OVER while minimizing actions.\n\nOne action produces one Frame. One Frame is made of one or more sequential\nGrids. Each Grid is a matrix size INT<0,63> by INT<0,63> filled with\nINT<0,15> values. Each value represents a different color and usually implies a different object.\n\nYou are playing a game called LockSmith.\n\n# CONTROLS\n* RESET: start over\n* ACTION1: move up\n* ACTION2: move down\n* ACTION3: move left\n* ACTION4: move right\n* ACTION5/ACTION6: no-ops\n\n# GOAL\nFind/generate a key that MATCHES the key pattern shown at the EXIT, then navigate to the EXIT to finish the level.\nThere are 6 levels total. Complete all levels to WIN.\n\n# TILE MEANINGS (important ones)\n* 0 = white cell (used in key patterns)\n* 3 = walkable path / corridor marker (often outlines routes to key/exit)\n* 4 = WALL (solid). You cannot enter 4s.\n* 5 = EXIT indicator (presence of 5s marks/frames the exit area)\n* 8 = LIFE token (count lives as the number of 2×2 blocks of 8s)\n* 9 = blue cells (used in player lower body; also appear elsewhere in the map and in key logic)\n* 12 = orange cells (used in player upper body)\n* 15 = MOVE counter (number of 15s ≈ moves/energy left)\n\n# PLAYER (sprite + movement legality)\n* The player is an 8×8 sprite made ONLY of 12s (top two rows) over 9s (bottom six rows).\n  - Concretely: rows 0–1 (relative to the sprite) are all 12s; rows 2–7 are all 9s.\n  - Other scattered 9s on the board are NOT the player—only the exact 8×8 (2×8 of 12s stacked on 6×8 of 9s) is the player.\n* Movement rules:\n  - You may move only through non-4 cells (i.e., never overlap a 4 after a move).\n  - If any part of your 8×8 sprite would overlap a 4 in the target direction (including cases where 4s lie “under” 9s), that move is ILLEGAL.\n  - If your sprite is already touching 4s on a side, you cannot move further in that touching direction until you have clearance.\n  - Practically: navigate corridors “between the 4s”.\n\n# KEYS, EXIT, AND HOW TO FIND THEM\n* The EXIT contains (or is adjacent to) the target key pattern and is marked by nearby 5s (it need not be fully surrounded; any 5s strongly indicate the exit region).\n* The bottom-left of the entire grid shows the REQUIRED KEY BLUEPRINT you must match: a specific layout of 0s (white) and 9s (blue).\n* Key generation mechanism (explicit):\n  - The KEY GENERATOR is a field/patch consisting of 0s and 9s that is NOT surrounded by 5s (i.e., not the exit).\n  - When any part of your 8×8 player walks onto this patch, a NEW candidate key is generated and displayed in the bottom-left.\n  - Step OFF the patch and then back ON to generate yet another candidate key; repeat to cycle through possibilities.\n  - You must keep cycling until the bottom-left candidate key EXACTLY matches the exit’s key (the same distribution of 0s and 9s seen within/adjacent to the 5s).\n* A reliable way to locate both the EXIT and the KEY GENERATOR area:\n  - Look for clusters of 0s and 9s reachable via 3s; if they are NOT framed by 5s, that area is most likely the generator. If you see 5s nearby framing a matching 0/9 pattern, that marks the exit.\n* When the pattern shown in the bottom-left matches the arrangement of 0s and 9s you see framed by (or adjacent to) 5s at the exit, move toward the 5s to complete the level.\n\n# HUD / PROGRESSION\n* Visual score on the second-to-last grid row (row 62): it contains several 4-cell “slots”.\n  - Slots made of 3s represent UNFINISHED levels.\n  - When a slot changes from 3s to another color, that level is COMPLETE.\n* Track remaining MOVES/ENERGY by counting tiles with value 15.\n* Track LIVES by counting distinct 2×2 blocks of 8s.\n\n# GENERAL NOTES\n* The grid is a bird’s-eye view.\n* If the grid does not change after an action, you likely attempted an illegal move into 4s.\n* Favor routes marked by 3s; scan for 0/9 patches (generator) and confirm exit by nearby 5s; confirm the key by matching the bottom-left blueprint of 0s/9s.\n\n# EXAMPLE STRATEGY OBSERVATION\nThe 8×8 player (top rows 12s, bottom rows 9s) is flush against 4s on the left, so LEFT is blocked. I can see a 0/9 patch reachable via 3s to the right (likely the generator) and some 5s beyond it, so I should move RIGHT toward that corridor, cycling the key on the generator until the bottom-left key matches the one at the exit.\n\n# TURN:\nCall exactly one action.\n"

There are scattered 0/9 patches that appear not to be enclosed by 5s, suggesting the KEY GENERATOR region is along the reachable 3s route to the right. The exit area (marked by nearby 5s) is likely beyond or past a generator patch. Plan: move right to reach a generator patch, step onto/off to cycle the candidate key, and repeat until the bottom-left key matches the exit blueprint, then head toward the 5s to finish."

    "content": "\n# CONTEXT:\nYou are an agent playing a dynamic game. Your objective is to\nWIN and avoid GAME_OVER while minimizing actions.\n\nOne action produces one Frame. One Frame is made of one or more sequential\nGrids. Each Grid is a matrix size INT<0,63> by INT<0,63> filled with\nINT<0,15> values. Each value represents a different color and usually implies a different object.\n\nYou are playing a game called LockSmith.\n\n# CONTROLS\n* RESET: start over\n* ACTION1: move up\n* ACTION2: move down\n* ACTION3: move left\n* ACTION4: move right\n* ACTION5/ACTION6: no-ops\n\n# GOAL\nFind/generate a key that MATCHES the key pattern shown at the EXIT, then navigate to the EXIT to finish the level.\nThere are 6 levels total. Complete all levels to WIN.\n\n# TILE MEANINGS (important ones)\n* 0 = white cell (used in key patterns)\n* 3 = walkable path / corridor marker (often outlines routes to key/exit)\n* 4 = WALL (solid). You cannot enter 4s.\n* 5 = EXIT indicator (presence of 5s marks/frames the exit area)\n* 8 = LIFE token (count lives as the number of 2×2 blocks of 8s)\n* 9 = blue cells (used in player lower body; also appear elsewhere in the map and in key logic)\n* 12 = orange cells (used in player upper body)\n* 15 = MOVE counter (number of 15s ≈ moves/energy left)\n\n# PLAYER (sprite + movement legality)\n* The player is an 8×8 sprite made ONLY of 12s (top two rows) over 9s (bottom six rows).\n  - Concretely: rows 0–1 (relative to the sprite) are all 12s; rows 2–7 are all 9s.\n  - Other scattered 9s on the board are NOT the player—only the exact 8×8 (2×8 of 12s stacked on 6×8 of 9s) is the player.\n* Movement rules:\n  - You may move only through non-4 cells (i.e., never overlap a 4 after a move).\n  - If any part of your 8×8 sprite would overlap a 4 in the target direction (including cases where 4s lie “under” 9s), that move is ILLEGAL.\n  - If your sprite is already touching 4s on a side, you cannot move further in that touching direction until you have clearance.\n  - Practically: navigate corridors “between the 4s”.\n\n# KEYS, EXIT, AND HOW TO FIND THEM\n* The EXIT contains (or is adjacent to) the target key pattern and is marked by nearby 5s (it need not be fully surrounded; any 5s strongly indicate the exit region).\n* The bottom-left of the entire grid shows the REQUIRED KEY BLUEPRINT you must match: a specific layout of 0s (white) and 9s (blue).\n* Key generation mechanism (explicit):\n  - The KEY GENERATOR is a field/patch consisting of 0s and 9s that is NOT surrounded by 5s (i.e., not the exit).\n  - When any part of your 8×8 player walks onto this patch, a NEW candidate key is generated and displayed in the bottom-left.\n  - Step OFF the patch and then back ON to generate yet another candidate key; repeat to cycle through possibilities.\n  - You must keep cycling until the bottom-left candidate key EXACTLY matches the exit’s key (the same distribution of 0s and 9s seen within/adjacent to the 5s).\n* A reliable way to locate both the EXIT and the KEY GENERATOR area:\n  - Look for clusters of 0s and 9s reachable via 3s; if they are NOT framed by 5s, that area is most likely the generator. If you see 5s nearby framing a matching 0/9 pattern, that marks the exit.\n* When the pattern shown in the bottom-left matches the arrangement of 0s and 9s you see framed by (or adjacent to) 5s at the exit, move toward the 5s to complete the level.\n\n# HUD / PROGRESSION\n* Visual score on the second-to-last grid row (row 62): it contains several 4-cell “slots”.\n  - Slots made of 3s represent UNFINISHED levels.\n  - When a slot changes from 3s to another color, that level is COMPLETE.\n* Track remaining MOVES/ENERGY by counting tiles with value 15.\n* Track LIVES by counting distinct 2×2 blocks of 8s.\n\n# GENERAL NOTES\n* The grid is a bird’s-eye view.\n* If the grid does not change after an action, you likely attempted an illegal move into 4s.\n* Favor routes marked by 3s; scan for 0/9 patches (generator) and confirm exit by nearby 5s; confirm the key by matching the bottom-left blueprint of 0s/9s.\n\n# EXAMPLE STRATEGY OBSERVATION\nThe 8×8 player (top rows 12s, bottom rows 9s) is flush against 4s on the left, so LEFT is blocked. I can see a 0/9 patch reachable via 3s to the right (likely the generator) and some 5s beyond it, so I should move RIGHT toward that corridor, cycling the key on the generator until the bottom-left key matches the one at the exit.\n\n# TURN:\nCall exactly one action.\n"

The bottom-left blueprint is the target key to match, while nearby 5s denote the exit zone. Next move should be to advance along the 3s corridor toward a 0/9 patch (generator), then cycle the key on/off to generate a new candidate. Plan: head RIGHT along the corridor to the likely generator patch while staying clear of 4s."

    "content": "\n# CONTEXT:\nYou are an agent playing a dynamic game. Your objective is to\nWIN and avoid GAME_OVER while minimizing actions.\n\nOne action produces one Frame. One Frame is made of one or more sequential\nGrids. Each Grid is a matrix size INT<0,63> by INT<0,63> filled with\nINT<0,15> values. Each value represents a different color and usually implies a different object.\n\nYou are playing a game called LockSmith.\n\n# CONTROLS\n* RESET: start over\n* ACTION1: move up\n* ACTION2: move down\n* ACTION3: move left\n* ACTION4: move right\n* ACTION5/ACTION6: no-ops\n\n# GOAL\nFind/generate a key that MATCHES the key pattern shown at the EXIT, then navigate to the EXIT to finish the level.\nThere are 6 levels total. Complete all levels to WIN.\n\n# TILE MEANINGS (important ones)\n* 0 = white cell (used in key patterns)\n* 3 = walkable path / corridor marker (often outlines routes to key/exit)\n* 4 = WALL (solid). You cannot enter 4s.\n* 5 = EXIT indicator (presence of 5s marks/frames the exit area)\n* 8 = LIFE token (count lives as the number of 2×2 blocks of 8s)\n* 9 = blue cells (used in player lower body; also appear elsewhere in the map and in key logic)\n* 12 = orange cells (used in player upper body)\n* 15 = MOVE counter (number of 15s ≈ moves/energy left)\n\n# PLAYER (sprite + movement legality)\n* The player is an 8×8 sprite made ONLY of 12s (top two rows) over 9s (bottom six rows).\n  - Concretely: rows 0–1 (relative to the sprite) are all 12s; rows 2–7 are all 9s.\n  - Other scattered 9s on the board are NOT the player—only the exact 8×8 (2×8 of 12s stacked on 6×8 of 9s) is the player.\n* Movement rules:\n  - You may move only through non-4 cells (i.e., never overlap a 4 after a move).\n  - If any part of your 8×8 sprite would overlap a 4 in the target direction (including cases where 4s lie “under” 9s), that move is ILLEGAL.\n  - If your sprite is already touching 4s on a side, you cannot move further in that touching direction until you have clearance.\n  - Practically: navigate corridors “between the 4s”.\n\n# KEYS, EXIT, AND HOW TO FIND THEM\n* The EXIT contains (or is adjacent to) the target key pattern and is marked by nearby 5s (it need not be fully surrounded; any 5s strongly indicate the exit region).\n* The bottom-left of the entire grid shows the REQUIRED KEY BLUEPRINT you must match: a specific layout of 0s (white) and 9s (blue).\n* Key generation mechanism (explicit):\n  - The KEY GENERATOR is a field/patch consisting of 0s and 9s that is NOT surrounded by 5s (i.e., not the exit).\n  - When any part of your 8×8 player walks onto this patch, a NEW candidate key is generated and displayed in the bottom-left.\n  - Step OFF the patch and then back ON to generate yet another candidate key; repeat to cycle through possibilities.\n  - You must keep cycling until the bottom-left candidate key EXACTLY matches the exit’s key (the same distribution of 0s and 9s seen within/adjacent to the 5s).\n* A reliable way to locate both the EXIT and the KEY GENERATOR area:\n  - Look for clusters of 0s and 9s reachable via 3s; if they are NOT framed by 5s, that area is most likely the generator. If you see 5s nearby framing a matching 0/9 pattern, that marks the exit.\n* When the pattern shown in the bottom-left matches the arrangement of 0s and 9s you see framed by (or adjacent to) 5s at the exit, move toward the 5s to complete the level.\n\n# HUD / PROGRESSION\n* Visual score on the second-to-last grid row (row 62): it contains several 4-cell “slots”.\n  - Slots made of 3s represent UNFINISHED levels.\n  - When a slot changes from 3s to another color, that level is COMPLETE.\n* Track remaining MOVES/ENERGY by counting tiles with value 15.\n* Track LIVES by counting distinct 2×2 blocks of 8s.\n\n# GENERAL NOTES\n* The grid is a bird’s-eye view.\n* If the grid does not change after an action, you likely attempted an illegal move into 4s.\n* Favor routes marked by 3s; scan for 0/9 patches (generator) and confirm exit by nearby 5s; confirm the key by matching the bottom-left blueprint of 0s/9s.\n\n# EXAMPLE STRATEGY OBSERVATION\nThe 8×8 player (top rows 12s, bottom rows 9s) is flush against 4s on the left, so LEFT is blocked. I can see a 0/9 patch reachable via 3s to the right (likely the generator) and some 5s beyond it, so I should move RIGHT toward that corridor, cycling the key on the generator until the bottom-left key matches the one at the exit.\n\n# TURN:\nCall exactly one action.\n"

    "content": "\n# CONTEXT:\nYou are an agent playing a dynamic game. Your objective is to\nWIN and avoid GAME_OVER while minimizing actions.\n\nOne action produces one Frame. One Frame is made of one or more sequential\nGrids. Each Grid is a matrix size INT<0,63> by INT<0,63> filled with\nINT<0,15> values. Each value represents a different color and usually implies a different object.\n\nYou are playing a game called LockSmith.\n\n# CONTROLS\n* RESET: start over\n* ACTION1: move up\n* ACTION2: move down\n* ACTION3: move left\n* ACTION4: move right\n* ACTION5/ACTION6: no-ops\n\n# GOAL\nFind/generate a key that MATCHES the key pattern shown at the EXIT, then navigate to the EXIT to finish the level.\nThere are 6 levels total. Complete all levels to WIN.\n\n# TILE MEANINGS (important ones)\n* 0 = white cell (used in key patterns)\n* 3 = walkable path / corridor marker (often outlines routes to key/exit)\n* 4 = WALL (solid).

Next move should be to advance along the 3s corridor toward a 0/9 patch (generator), then cycle the key on/off to generate a new candidate.

    "content": "\n# CONTEXT:\nYou are an agent playing a dynamic game. Your objective is to\nWIN and avoid GAME_OVER while minimizing actions.\n\nOne action produces one Frame. One Frame is made of one or more sequential\nGrids. Each Grid is a matrix size INT<0,63> by INT<0,63> filled with\nINT<0,15> values. Each value represents a different color and usually implies a different object.\n\nYou are playing a game called LockSmith.\n\n# CONTROLS\n* RESET: start over\n* ACTION1: move up\n* ACTION2: move down\n* ACTION3: move left\n* ACTION4: move right\n* ACTION5/ACTION6: no-ops\n\n# GOAL\nFind/generate a key that MATCHES the key pattern shown at the EXIT, then navigate to the EXIT to finish the level.\nThere are 6 levels total. Complete all levels to WIN.\n\n# TILE MEANINGS (important ones)\n* 0 = white cell (used in key patterns)\n* 3 = walkable path / corridor marker (often outlines routes to key/exit)\n* 4 = WALL (solid). You cannot enter 4s.\n* 5 = EXIT indicator (presence of 5s marks/frames the exit area)\n* 8 = LIFE token (count lives as the number of 2×2 blocks of 8s)\n* 9 = blue cells (used in player lower body; also appear elsewhere in the map and in key logic)\n* 12 = orange cells (used in player upper body)\n* 15 = MOVE counter (number of 15s ≈ moves/energy left)\n\n# PLAYER (sprite + movement legality)\n* The player is an 8×8 sprite made ONLY of 12s (top two rows) over 9s (bottom six rows).\n  - Concretely: rows 0–1 (relative to the sprite) are all 12s; rows 2–7 are all 9s.\n  - Other scattered 9s on the board are NOT the player—only the exact 8×8 (2×8 of 12s stacked on 6×8 of 9s) is the player.\n* Movement rules:\n  - You may move only through non-4 cells (i.e., never overlap a 4 after a move).\n  - If any part of your 8×8 sprite would overlap a 4 in the target direction (including cases where 4s lie “under” 9s), that move is ILLEGAL.\n  - If your sprite is already touching 4s on a side, you cannot move further in that touching direction until you have clearance.\n  - Practically: navigate corridors “between the 4s”.\n\n# KEYS, EXIT, AND HOW TO FIND THEM\n* The EXIT contains (or is adjacent to) the target key pattern and is marked by nearby 5s (it need not be fully surrounded; any 5s strongly indicate the exit region).\n* The bottom-left of the entire grid shows the REQUIRED KEY BLUEPRINT you must match: a specific layout of 0s (white) and 9s (blue).\n* Key generation mechanism (explicit):\n  - The KEY GENERATOR is a field/patch consisting of 0s and 9s that is NOT surrounded by 5s (i.e., not the exit).\n  - When any part of your 8×8 player walks onto this patch, a NEW candidate key is generated and displayed in the bottom-left.\n  - Step OFF the patch and then back ON to generate yet another candidate key; repeat to cycle through possibilities.\n  - You must keep cycling until the bottom-left candidate key EXACTLY matches the exit’s key (the same distribution of 0s and 9s seen within/adjacent to the 5s).\n* A reliable way to locate both the EXIT and the KEY GENERATOR area:\n  - Look for clusters of 0s and 9s reachable via 3s; if they are NOT framed by 5s, that area is most likely the generator. If you see 5s nearby framing a matching 0/9 pattern, that marks the exit.\n* When the pattern shown in the bottom-left matches the arrangement of 0s and 9s you see framed by (or adjacent to) 5s at the exit, move toward the 5s to complete the level.\n\n# HUD / PROGRESSION\n* Visual score on the second-to-last grid row (row 62): it contains several 4-cell “slots”.\n  - Slots made of 3s represent UNFINISHED levels.\n  - When a slot changes from 3s to another color, that level is COMPLETE.\n* Track remaining MOVES/ENERGY by counting tiles with value 15.\n* Track LIVES by counting distinct 2×2 blocks of 8s.\n\n# GENERAL NOTES\n* The grid is a bird’s-eye view.\n* If the grid does not change after an action, you likely attempted an illegal move into 4s.\n* Favor routes marked by 3s; scan for 0/9 patches (generator) and confirm exit by nearby 5s; confirm the key by matching the bottom-left blueprint of 0s/9s.\n\n# EXAMPLE STRATEGY OBSERVATION\nThe 8×8 player (top rows 12s, bottom rows 9s) is flush against 4s on the left, so LEFT is blocked. I can see a 0/9 patch reachable via 3s to the right (likely the generator) and some 5s beyond it, so I should move RIGHT toward that corridor, cycling the key on the generator until the bottom-left key matches the one at the exit.\n\n# TURN:\nCall exactly one action.\n"

Complete all levels to WIN.\n\n# TILE MEANINGS (important ones)\n* 0 = white cell (used in key patterns)\n* 3 = walkable path / corridor marker (often outlines routes to key/exit)\n* 4 = WALL (solid). You cannot enter 4s.\n* 5 = EXIT indicator (presence of 5s marks/frames the exit area)\n* 8 = LIFE token (count lives as the number of 2×2 blocks of 8s)\n* 9 = blue cells (used in player lower body; also appear elsewhere in the map and in key logic)\n* 12 = orange cells (used in player upper body)\n* 15 = MOVE counter (number of 15s ≈ moves/energy left)\n\n# PLAYER (sprite + movement legality)\n* The player is an 8×8 sprite made ONLY of 12s (top two rows) over 9s (bottom six rows).\n  - Concretely: rows 0–1 (relative to the sprite) are all 12s; rows 2–7 are all 9s.\n  - Other scattered 9s on the board are NOT the player—only the exact 8×8 (2×8 of 12s stacked on 6×8 of 9s) is the player.\n* Movement rules:\n  - You may move only through non-4 cells (i.e., never overlap a 4 after a move).\n  - If any part of your 8×8 sprite would overlap a 4 in the target direction (including cases where 4s lie “under” 9s), that move is ILLEGAL.\n  - If your sprite is already touching 4s on a side, you cannot move further in that touching direction until you have clearance.\n  - Practically: navigate corridors “between the 4s”.\n\n# KEYS, EXIT, AND HOW TO FIND THEM\n* The EXIT contains (or is adjacent to) the target key pattern and is marked by nearby 5s (it need not be fully surrounded; any 5s strongly indicate the exit region).\n* The bottom-left of the entire grid shows the REQUIRED KEY BLUEPRINT you must match: a specific layout of 0s (white) and 9s (blue).\n* Key generation mechanism (explicit):\n  - The KEY GENERATOR is a field/patch consisting of 0s and 9s that is NOT surrounded by 5s (i.e., not the exit).\n  - When any part of your 8×8 player walks onto this patch, a NEW candidate key is generated and displayed in the bottom-left.\n  - Step OFF the patch and then back ON to generate yet another candidate key; repeat to cycle through possibilities.\n  - You must keep cycling until the bottom-left candidate key EXACTLY matches the exit’s key (the same distribution of 0s and 9s seen within/adjacent to the 5s).\n* A reliable way to locate both the EXIT and the KEY GENERATOR area:\n  - Look for clusters of 0s and 9s reachable via 3s; if they are NOT framed by 5s, that area is most likely the generator. If you see 5s nearby framing a matching 0/9 pattern, that marks the exit.\n* When the pattern shown in the bottom-left matches the arrangement of 0s and 9s you see framed by (or adjacent to) 5s at the exit, move toward the 5s to complete the level.\n\n# HUD / PROGRESSION\n* Visual score on the second-to-last grid row (row 62): it contains several 4-cell “slots”.\n  - Slots made of 3s represent UNFINISHED levels.\n  - When a slot changes from 3s to another color, that level is COMPLETE.\n* Track remaining MOVES/ENERGY by counting tiles with value 15.\n* Track LIVES by counting distinct 2×2 blocks of 8s.\n\n# GENERAL NOTES\n* The grid is a bird’s-eye view.\n* If the grid does not change after an action, you likely attempted an illegal move into 4s.\n* Favor routes marked by 3s; scan for 0/9 patches (generator) and confirm exit by nearby 5s; confirm the key by matching the bottom-left blueprint of 0s/9s.\n\n# EXAMPLE STRATEGY OBSERVATION\nThe 8×8 player (top rows 12s, bottom rows 9s) is flush against 4s on the left, so LEFT is blocked. I can see a 0/9 patch reachable via 3s to the right (likely the generator) and some 5s beyond it, so I should move RIGHT toward that corridor, cycling the key on the generator until the bottom-left key matches the one at the exit.\n\n# TURN:\nCall exactly one action.\n"

    "content": "\n# CONTEXT:\nYou are an agent playing a dynamic game. Your objective is to\nWIN and avoid GAME_OVER while minimizing actions.\n\nOne action produces one Frame. One Frame is made of one or more sequential\nGrids. Each Grid is a matrix size INT<0,63> by INT<0,63> filled with\nINT<0,15> values. Each value represents a different color and usually implies a different object.\n\nYou are playing a game called LockSmith.\n\n# CONTROLS\n* RESET: start over\n* ACTION1: move up\n* ACTION2: move down\n* ACTION3: move left\n* ACTION4: move right\n* ACTION5/ACTION6: no-ops\n\n# GOAL\nFind/generate a key that MATCHES the key pattern shown at the EXIT, then navigate to the EXIT to finish the level.\nThere are 6 levels total. Complete all levels to WIN.\n\n# TILE MEANINGS (important ones)\n* 0 = white cell (used in key patterns)\n* 3 = walkable path / corridor marker (often outlines routes to key/exit)\n* 4 = WALL (solid). You cannot enter 4s.\n* 5 = EXIT indicator (presence of 5s marks/frames the exit area)\n* 8 = LIFE token (count lives as the number of 2×2 blocks of 8s)\n* 9 = blue cells (used in player lower body; also appear elsewhere in the map and in key logic)\n* 12 = orange cells (used in player upper body)\n* 15 = MOVE counter (number of 15s ≈ moves/energy left)\n\n# PLAYER (sprite + movement legality)\n* The player is an 8×8 sprite made ONLY of 12s (top two rows) over 9s (bottom six rows).\n  - Concretely: rows 0–1 (relative to the sprite) are all 12s; rows 2–7 are all 9s.\n  - Other scattered 9s on the board are NOT the player—only the exact 8×8 (2×8 of 12s stacked on 6×8 of 9s) is the player.\n* Movement rules:\n  - You may move only through non-4 cells (i.e., never overlap a 4 after a move).\n  - If any part of your 8×8 sprite would overlap a 4 in the target direction (including cases where 4s lie “under” 9s), that move is ILLEGAL.\n  - If your sprite is already touching 4s on a side, you cannot move further in that touching direction until you have clearance.\n  - Practically: navigate corridors “between the 4s”.\n\n# KEYS, EXIT, AND HOW TO FIND THEM\n* The EXIT contains (or is adjacent to) the target key pattern and is marked by nearby 5s (it need not be fully surrounded; any 5s strongly indicate the exit region).\n* The bottom-left of the entire grid shows the REQUIRED KEY BLUEPRINT you must match: a specific layout of 0s (white) and 9s (blue).\n* Key generation mechanism (explicit):\n  - The KEY GENERATOR is a field/patch consisting of 0s and 9s that is NOT surrounded by 5s (i.e., not the exit).\n  - When any part of your 8×8 player walks onto this patch, a NEW candidate key is generated and displayed in the bottom-left.\n  - Step OFF the patch and then back ON to generate yet another candidate key; repeat to cycle through possibilities.\n  - You must keep cycling until the bottom-left candidate key EXACTLY matches the exit’s key (the same distribution of 0s and 9s seen within/adjacent to the 5s).\n* A reliable way to locate both the EXIT and the KEY GENERATOR area:\n  - Look for clusters of 0s and 9s reachable via 3s; if they are NOT framed by 5s, that area is most likely the generator. If you see 5s nearby framing a matching 0/9 pattern, that marks the exit.\n* When the pattern shown in the bottom-left matches the arrangement of 0s and 9s you see framed by (or adjacent to) 5s at the exit, move toward the 5s to complete the level.\n\n# HUD / PROGRESSION\n* Visual score on the second-to-last grid row (row 62): it contains several 4-cell “slots”.\n  - Slots made of 3s represent UNFINISHED levels.\n  - When a slot changes from 3s to another color, that level is COMPLETE.\n* Track remaining MOVES/ENERGY by counting tiles with value 15.\n* Track LIVES by counting distinct 2×2 blocks of 8s.\n\n# GENERAL NOTES\n* The grid is a bird’s-eye view.\n* If the grid does not change after an action, you likely attempted an illegal move into 4s.\n* Favor routes marked by 3s; scan for 0/9 patches (generator) and confirm exit by nearby 5s; confirm the key by matching the bottom-left blueprint of 0s/9s.\n\n# EXAMPLE STRATEGY OBSERVATION\nThe 8×8 player (top rows 12s, bottom rows 9s) is flush against 4s on the left, so LEFT is blocked. I can see a 0/9 patch reachable via 3s to the right (likely the generator) and some 5s beyond it, so I should move RIGHT toward that corridor, cycling the key on the generator until the bottom-left key matches the one at the exit.\n\n# TURN:\nCall exactly one action.\n"

    "content": "\n# CONTEXT:\nYou are an agent playing a dynamic game. Your objective is to\nWIN and avoid GAME_OVER while minimizing actions.\n\nOne action produces one Frame. One Frame is made of one or more sequential\nGrids. Each Grid is a matrix size INT<0,63> by INT<0,63> filled with\nINT<0,15> values. Each value represents a different color and usually implies a different object.\n\nYou are playing a game called LockSmith.\n\n# CONTROLS\n* RESET: start over\n* ACTION1: move up\n* ACTION2: move down\n* ACTION3: move left\n* ACTION4: move right\n* ACTION5/ACTION6: no-ops\n\n# GOAL\nFind/generate a key that MATCHES the key pattern shown at the EXIT, then navigate to the EXIT to finish the level.\nThere are 6 levels total. Complete all levels to WIN.\n\n# TILE MEANINGS (important ones)\n* 0 = white cell (used in key patterns)\n* 3 = walkable path / corridor marker (often outlines routes to key/exit)\n* 4 = WALL (solid). You cannot enter 4s.\n* 5 = EXIT indicator (presence of 5s marks/frames the exit area)\n* 8 = LIFE token (count lives as the number of 2×2 blocks of 8s)\n* 9 = blue cells (used in player lower body; also appear elsewhere in the map and in key logic)\n* 12 = orange cells (used in player upper body)\n* 15 = MOVE counter (number of 15s ≈ moves/energy left)\n\n# PLAYER (sprite + movement legality)\n* The player is an 8×8 sprite made ONLY of 12s (top two rows) over 9s (bottom six rows).\n  - Concretely: rows 0–1 (relative to the sprite) are all 12s; rows 2–7 are all 9s.\n  - Other scattered 9s on the board are NOT the player—only the exact 8×8 (2×8 of 12s stacked on 6×8 of 9s) is the player.\n* Movement rules:\n  - You may move only through non-4 cells (i.e., never overlap a 4 after a move).\n  - If any part of your 8×8 sprite would overlap a 4 in the target direction (including cases where 4s lie “under” 9s), that move is ILLEGAL.\n  - If your sprite is already touching 4s on a side, you cannot move further in that touching direction until you have clearance.\n  - Practically: navigate corridors “between the 4s”.\n\n# KEYS, EXIT, AND HOW TO FIND THEM\n* The EXIT contains (or is adjacent to) the target key pattern and is marked by nearby 5s (it need not be fully surrounded; any 5s strongly indicate the exit region).\n* The bottom-left of the entire grid shows the REQUIRED KEY BLUEPRINT you must match: a specific layout of 0s (white) and 9s (blue).\n* Key generation mechanism (explicit):\n  - The KEY GENERATOR is a field/patch consisting of 0s and 9s that is NOT surrounded by 5s (i.e., not the exit).\n  - When any part of your 8×8 player walks onto this patch, a NEW candidate key is generated and displayed in the bottom-left.\n  - Step OFF the patch and then back ON to generate yet another candidate key; repeat to cycle through possibilities.\n  - You must keep cycling until the bottom-left candidate key EXACTLY matches the exit’s key (the same distribution of 0s and 9s seen within/adjacent to the 5s).\n* A reliable way to locate both the EXIT and the KEY GENERATOR area:\n  - Look for clusters of 0s and 9s reachable via 3s; if they are NOT framed by 5s, that area is most likely the generator. If you see 5s nearby framing a matching 0/9 pattern, that marks the exit.\n* When the pattern shown in the bottom-left matches the arrangement of 0s and 9s you see framed by (or adjacent to) 5s at the exit, move toward the 5s to complete the level.\n\n# HUD / PROGRESSION\n* Visual score on the second-to-last grid row (row 62): it contains several 4-cell “slots”.\n  - Slots made of 3s represent UNFINISHED levels.\n  - When a slot changes from 3s to another color, that level is COMPLETE.\n* Track remaining MOVES/ENERGY by counting tiles with value 15.\n* Track LIVES by counting distinct 2×2 blocks of 8s.\n\n# GENERAL NOTES\n* The grid is a bird’s-eye view.\n* If the grid does not change after an action, you likely attempted an illegal move into 4s.\n* Favor routes marked by 3s; scan for 0/9 patches (generator) and confirm exit by nearby 5s; confirm the key by matching the bottom-left blueprint of 0s/9s.\n\n# EXAMPLE STRATEGY OBSERVATION\nThe 8×8 player (top rows 12s, bottom rows 9s) is flush against 4s on the left, so LEFT is blocked. I can see a 0/9 patch reachable via 3s to the right (likely the generator) and some 5s beyond it, so I should move RIGHT toward that corridor, cycling the key on the generator until the bottom-left key matches the one at the exit.\n\n# TURN:\nCall exactly one action.\n"

    "content": "\n# CONTEXT:\nYou are an agent playing a dynamic game. Your objective is to\nWIN and avoid GAME_OVER while minimizing actions.\n\nOne action produces one Frame. One Frame is made of one or more sequential\nGrids. Each Grid is a matrix size INT<0,63> by INT<0,63> filled with\nINT<0,15> values. Each value represents a different color and usually implies a different object.\n\nYou are playing a game called LockSmith.\n\n# CONTROLS\n* RESET: start over\n* ACTION1: move up\n* ACTION2: move down\n* ACTION3: move left\n* ACTION4: move right\n* ACTION5/ACTION6: no-ops\n\n# GOAL\nFind/generate a key that MATCHES the key pattern shown at the EXIT, then navigate to the EXIT to finish the level.\nThere are 6 levels total. Complete all levels to WIN.\n\n# TILE MEANINGS (important ones)\n* 0 = white cell (used in key patterns)\n* 3 = walkable path / corridor marker (often outlines routes to key/exit)\n* 4 = WALL (solid). You cannot enter 4s.\n* 5 = EXIT indicator (presence of 5s marks/frames the exit area)\n* 8 = LIFE token (count lives as the number of 2×2 blocks of 8s)\n* 9 = blue cells (used in player lower body; also appear elsewhere in the map and in key logic)\n* 12 = orange cells (used in player upper body)\n* 15 = MOVE counter (number of 15s ≈ moves/energy left)\n\n# PLAYER (sprite + movement legality)\n* The player is an 8×8 sprite made ONLY of 12s (top two rows) over 9s (bottom six rows).\n  - Concretely: rows 0–1 (relative to the sprite) are all 12s; rows 2–7 are all 9s.\n  - Other scattered 9s on the board are NOT the player—only the exact 8×8 (2×8 of 12s stacked on 6×8 of 9s) is the player.\n* Movement rules:\n  - You may move only through non-4 cells (i.e., never overlap a 4 after a move).\n  - If any part of your 8×8 sprite would overlap a 4 in the target direction (including cases where 4s lie “under” 9s), that move is ILLEGAL.\n  - If your sprite is already touching 4s on a side, you cannot move further in that touching direction until you have clearance.\n  - Practically: navigate corridors “between the 4s”.\n\n# KEYS, EXIT, AND HOW TO FIND THEM\n* The EXIT contains (or is adjacent to) the target key pattern and is marked by nearby 5s (it need not be fully surrounded; any 5s strongly indicate the exit region).\n* The bottom-left of the entire grid shows the REQUIRED KEY BLUEPRINT you must match: a specific layout of 0s (white) and 9s (blue).\n* Key generation mechanism (explicit):\n  - The KEY GENERATOR is a field/patch consisting of 0s and 9s that is NOT surrounded by 5s (i.e., not the exit).\n  - When any part of your 8×8 player walks onto this patch, a NEW candidate key is generated and displayed in the bottom-left.\n  - Step OFF the patch and then back ON to generate yet another candidate key; repeat to cycle through possibilities.\n  - You must keep cycling until the bottom-left candidate key EXACTLY matches the exit’s key (the same distribution of 0s and 9s seen within/adjacent to the 5s).\n* A reliable way to locate both the EXIT and the KEY GENERATOR area:\n  - Look for clusters of 0s and 9s reachable via 3s; if they are NOT framed by 5s, that area is most likely the generator. If you see 5s nearby framing a matching 0/9 pattern, that marks the exit.\n* When the pattern shown in the bottom-left matches the arrangement of 0s and 9s you see framed by (or adjacent to) 5s at the exit, move toward the 5s to complete the level.\n\n# HUD / PROGRESSION\n* Visual score on the second-to-last grid row (row 62): it contains several 4-cell “slots”.\n  - Slots made of 3s represent UNFINISHED levels.\n  - When a slot changes from 3s to another color, that level is COMPLETE.\n* Track remaining MOVES/ENERGY by counting tiles with value 15.\n* Track LIVES by counting distinct 2×2 blocks of 8s.\n\n# GENERAL NOTES\n* The grid is a bird’s-eye view.\n* If the grid does not change after an action, you likely attempted an illegal move into 4s.\n* Favor routes marked by 3s; scan for 0/9 patches (generator) and confirm exit by nearby 5s; confirm the key by matching the bottom-left blueprint of 0s/9s.\n\n# EXAMPLE STRATEGY OBSERVATION\nThe 8×8 player (top rows 12s, bottom rows 9s) is flush against 4s on the left, so LEFT is blocked. I can see a 0/9 patch reachable via 3s to the right (likely the generator) and some 5s beyond it, so I should move RIGHT toward that corridor, cycling the key on the generator until the bottom-left key matches the one at the exit.\n\n# TURN:\nCall exactly one action.\n"

    "content": "\n# CONTEXT:\nYou are an agent playing a dynamic game. Your objective is to\nWIN and avoid GAME_OVER while minimizing actions.\n\nOne action produces one Frame. One Frame is made of one or more sequential\nGrids. Each Grid is a matrix size INT<0,63> by INT<0,63> filled with\nINT<0,15> values. Each value represents a different color and usually implies a different object.\n\nYou are playing a game called LockSmith.\n\n# CONTROLS\n* RESET: start over\n* ACTION1: move up\n* ACTION2: move down\n* ACTION3: move left\n* ACTION4: move right\n* ACTION5/ACTION6: no-ops\n\n# GOAL\nFind/generate a key that MATCHES the key pattern shown at the EXIT, then navigate to the EXIT to finish the level.\nThere are 6 levels total. Complete all levels to WIN.\n\n# TILE MEANINGS (important ones)\n* 0 = white cell (used in key patterns)\n* 3 = walkable path / corridor marker (often outlines routes to key/exit)\n* 4 = WALL (solid). You cannot enter 4s.\n* 5 = EXIT indicator (presence of 5s marks/frames the exit area)\n* 8 = LIFE token (count lives as the number of 2×2 blocks of 8s)\n* 9 = blue cells (used in player lower body; also appear elsewhere in the map and in key logic)\n* 12 = orange cells (used in player upper body)\n* 15 = MOVE counter (number of 15s ≈ moves/energy left)\n\n# PLAYER (sprite + movement legality)\n* The player is an 8×8 sprite made ONLY of 12s (top two rows) over 9s (bottom six rows).\n  - Concretely: rows 0–1 (relative to the sprite) are all 12s; rows 2–7 are all 9s.\n  - Other scattered 9s on the board are NOT the player—only the exact 8×8 (2×8 of 12s stacked on 6×8 of 9s) is the player.\n* Movement rules:\n  - You may move only through non-4 cells (i.e., never overlap a 4 after a move).\n  - If any part of your 8×8 sprite would overlap a 4 in the target direction (including cases where 4s lie “under” 9s), that move is ILLEGAL.\n  - If your sprite is already touching 4s on a side, you cannot move further in that touching direction until you have clearance.\n  - Practically: navigate corridors “between the 4s”.\n\n# KEYS, EXIT, AND HOW TO FIND THEM\n* The EXIT contains (or is adjacent to) the target key pattern and is marked by nearby 5s (it need not be fully surrounded; any 5s strongly indicate the exit region).\n* The bottom-left of the entire grid shows the REQUIRED KEY BLUEPRINT you must match: a specific layout of 0s (white) and 9s (blue).\n* Key generation mechanism (explicit):\n  - The KEY GENERATOR is a field/patch consisting of 0s and 9s that is NOT surrounded by 5s (i.e., not the exit).\n  - When any part of your 8×8 player walks onto this patch, a NEW candidate key is generated and displayed in the bottom-left.\n  - Step OFF the patch and then back ON to generate yet another candidate key; repeat to cycle through possibilities.\n  - You must keep cycling until the bottom-left candidate key EXACTLY matches the exit’s key (the same distribution of 0s and 9s seen within/adjacent to the 5s).\n* A reliable way to locate both the EXIT and the KEY GENERATOR area:\n  - Look for clusters of 0s and 9s reachable via 3s; if they are NOT framed by 5s, that area is most likely the generator. If you see 5s nearby framing a matching 0/9 pattern, that marks the exit.\n* When the pattern shown in the bottom-left matches the arrangement of 0s and 9s you see framed by (or adjacent to) 5s at the exit, move toward the 5s to complete the level.\n\n# HUD / PROGRESSION\n* Visual score on the second-to-last grid row (row 62): it contains several 4-cell “slots”.\n  - Slots made of 3s represent UNFINISHED levels.\n  - When a slot changes from 3s to another color, that level is COMPLETE.\n* Track remaining MOVES/ENERGY by counting tiles with value 15.\n* Track LIVES by counting distinct 2×2 blocks of 8s.\n\n# GENERAL NOTES\n* The grid is a bird’s-eye view.\n* If the grid does not change after an action, you likely attempted an illegal move into 4s.\n* Favor routes marked by 3s; scan for 0/9 patches (generator) and confirm exit by nearby 5s; confirm the key by matching the bottom-left blueprint of 0s/9s.\n\n# EXAMPLE STRATEGY OBSERVATION\nThe 8×8 player (top rows 12s, bottom rows 9s) is flush against 4s on the left, so LEFT is blocked. I can see a 0/9 patch reachable via 3s to the right (likely the generator) and some 5s beyond it, so I should move RIGHT toward that corridor, cycling the key on the generator until the bottom-left key matches the one at the exit.\n\n# TURN:\nCall exactly one action.\n"

    "content": "\n# CONTEXT:\nYou are an agent playing a dynamic game. Your objective is to\nWIN and avoid GAME_OVER while minimizing actions.\n\nOne action produces one Frame. One Frame is made of one or more sequential\nGrids. Each Grid is a matrix size INT<0,63> by INT<0,63> filled with\nINT<0,15> values. Each value represents a different color and usually implies a different object.\n\nYou are playing a game called LockSmith.\n\n# CONTROLS\n* RESET: start over\n* ACTION1: move up\n* ACTION2: move down\n* ACTION3: move left\n* ACTION4: move right\n* ACTION5/ACTION6: no-ops\n\n# GOAL\nFind/generate a key that MATCHES the key pattern shown at the EXIT, then navigate to the EXIT to finish the level.\nThere are 6 levels total. Complete all levels to WIN.\n\n# TILE MEANINGS (important ones)\n* 0 = white cell (used in key patterns)\n* 3 = walkable path / corridor marker (often outlines routes to key/exit)\n* 4 = WALL (solid). You cannot enter 4s.\n* 5 = EXIT indicator (presence of 5s marks/frames the exit area)\n* 8 = LIFE token (count lives as the number of 2×2 blocks of 8s)\n* 9 = blue cells (used in player lower body; also appear elsewhere in the map and in key logic)\n* 12 = orange cells (used in player upper body)\n* 15 = MOVE counter (number of 15s ≈ moves/energy left)\n\n# PLAYER (sprite + movement legality)\n* The player is an 8×8 sprite made ONLY of 12s (top two rows) over 9s (bottom six rows).\n  - Concretely: rows 0–1 (relative to the sprite) are all 12s; rows 2–7 are all 9s.\n  - Other scattered 9s on the board are NOT the player—only the exact 8×8 (2×8 of 12s stacked on 6×8 of 9s) is the player.\n* Movement rules:\n  - You may move only through non-4 cells (i.e., never overlap a 4 after a move).\n  - If any part of your 8×8 sprite would overlap a 4 in the target direction (including cases where 4s lie “under” 9s), that move is ILLEGAL.\n  - If your sprite is already touching 4s on a side, you cannot move further in that touching direction until you have clearance.\n  - Practically: navigate corridors “between the 4s”.\n\n# KEYS, EXIT, AND HOW TO FIND THEM\n* The EXIT contains (or is adjacent to) the target key pattern and is marked by nearby 5s (it need not be fully surrounded; any 5s strongly indicate the exit region).\n* The bottom-left of the entire grid shows the REQUIRED KEY BLUEPRINT you must match: a specific layout of 0s (white) and 9s (blue).\n* Key generation mechanism (explicit):\n  - The KEY GENERATOR is a field/patch consisting of 0s and 9s that is NOT surrounded by 5s (i.e., not the exit).\n  - When any part of your 8×8 player walks onto this patch, a NEW candidate key is generated and displayed in the bottom-left.\n  - Step OFF the patch and then back ON to generate yet another candidate key; repeat to cycle through possibilities.\n  - You must keep cycling until the bottom-left candidate key EXACTLY matches the exit’s key (the same distribution of 0s and 9s seen within/adjacent to the 5s).\n* A reliable way to locate both the EXIT and the KEY GENERATOR area:\n  - Look for clusters of 0s and 9s reachable via 3s; if they are NOT framed by 5s, that area is most likely the generator. If you see 5s nearby framing a matching 0/9 pattern, that marks the exit.\n* When the pattern shown in the bottom-left matches the arrangement of 0s and 9s you see framed by (or adjacent to) 5s at the exit, move toward the 5s to complete the level.\n\n# HUD / PROGRESSION\n* Visual score on the second-to-last grid row (row 62): it contains several 4-cell “slots”.\n  - Slots made of 3s represent UNFINISHED levels.\n  - When a slot changes from 3s to another color, that level is COMPLETE.\n* Track remaining MOVES/ENERGY by counting tiles with value 15.\n* Track LIVES by counting distinct 2×2 blocks of 8s.\n\n# GENERAL NOTES\n* The grid is a bird’s-eye view.\n* If the grid does not change after an action, you likely attempted an illegal move into 4s.\n* Favor routes marked by 3s; scan for 0/9 patches (generator) and confirm exit by nearby 5s; confirm the key by matching the bottom-left blueprint of 0s/9s.\n\n# EXAMPLE STRATEGY OBSERVATION\nThe 8×8 player (top rows 12s, bottom rows 9s) is flush against 4s on the left, so LEFT is blocked. I can see a 0/9 patch reachable via 3s to the right (likely the generator) and some 5s beyond it, so I should move RIGHT toward that corridor, cycling the key on the generator until the bottom-left key matches the one at the exit.\n\n# TURN:\nCall exactly one action.\n"

I can see a 0/9 patch reachable via 3s to the right (likely the generator) and some 5s beyond it, so I should move RIGHT toward that corridor, cycling the key on the generator until the bottom-left key matches the one at the exit.\n\n# TURN:\nCall exactly one action.\n"

    "content": "\n# CONTEXT:\nYou are an agent playing a dynamic game. Your objective is to\nWIN and avoid GAME_OVER while minimizing actions.\n\nOne action produces one Frame. One Frame is made of one or more sequential\nGrids. Each Grid is a matrix size INT<0,63> by INT<0,63> filled with\nINT<0,15> values. Each value represents a different color and usually implies a different object.\n\nYou are playing a game called LockSmith.\n\n# CONTROLS\n* RESET: start over\n* ACTION1: move up\n* ACTION2: move down\n* ACTION3: move left\n* ACTION4: move right\n* ACTION5/ACTION6: no-ops\n\n# GOAL\nFind/generate a key that MATCHES the key pattern shown at the EXIT, then navigate to the EXIT to finish the level.\nThere are 6 levels total. Complete all levels to WIN.\n\n# TILE MEANINGS (important ones)\n* 0 = white cell (used in key patterns)\n* 3 = walkable path / corridor marker (often outlines routes to key/exit)\n* 4 = WALL (solid). You cannot enter 4s.\n* 5 = EXIT indicator (presence of 5s marks/frames the exit area)\n* 8 = LIFE token (count lives as the number of 2×2 blocks of 8s)\n* 9 = blue cells (used in player lower body; also appear elsewhere in the map and in key logic)\n* 12 = orange cells (used in player upper body)\n* 15 = MOVE counter (number of 15s ≈ moves/energy left)\n\n# PLAYER (sprite + movement legality)\n* The player is an 8×8 sprite made ONLY of 12s (top two rows) over 9s (bottom six rows).\n  - Concretely: rows 0–1 (relative to the sprite) are all 12s; rows 2–7 are all 9s.\n  - Other scattered 9s on the board are NOT the player—only the exact 8×8 (2×8 of 12s stacked on 6×8 of 9s) is the player.\n* Movement rules:\n  - You may move only through non-4 cells (i.e., never overlap a 4 after a move).\n  - If any part of your 8×8 sprite would overlap a 4 in the target direction (including cases where 4s lie “under” 9s), that move is ILLEGAL.\n  - If your sprite is already touching 4s on a side, you cannot move further in that touching direction until you have clearance.\n  - Practically: navigate corridors “between the 4s”.\n\n# KEYS, EXIT, AND HOW TO FIND THEM\n* The EXIT contains (or is adjacent to) the target key pattern and is marked by nearby 5s (it need not be fully surrounded; any 5s strongly indicate the exit region).\n* The bottom-left of the entire grid shows the REQUIRED KEY BLUEPRINT you must match: a specific layout of 0s (white) and 9s (blue).\n* Key generation mechanism (explicit):\n  - The KEY GENERATOR is a field/patch consisting of 0s and 9s that is NOT surrounded by 5s (i.e., not the exit).\n  - When any part of your 8×8 player walks onto this patch, a NEW candidate key is generated and displayed in the bottom-left.\n  - Step OFF the patch and then back ON to generate yet another candidate key; repeat to cycle through possibilities.\n  - You must keep cycling until the bottom-left candidate key EXACTLY matches the exit’s key (the same distribution of 0s and 9s seen within/adjacent to the 5s).\n* A reliable way to locate both the EXIT and the KEY GENERATOR area:\n  - Look for clusters of 0s and 9s reachable via 3s; if they are NOT framed by 5s, that area is most likely the generator. If you see 5s nearby framing a matching 0/9 pattern, that marks the exit.\n* When the pattern shown in the bottom-left matches the arrangement of 0s and 9s you see framed by (or adjacent to) 5s at the exit, move toward the 5s to complete the level.\n\n# HUD / PROGRESSION\n* Visual score on the second-to-last grid row (row 62): it contains several 4-cell “slots”.\n  - Slots made of 3s represent UNFINISHED levels.\n  - When a slot changes from 3s to another color, that level is COMPLETE.\n* Track remaining MOVES/ENERGY by counting tiles with value 15.\n* Track LIVES by counting distinct 2×2 blocks of 8s.\n\n# GENERAL NOTES\n* The grid is a bird’s-eye view.\n* If the grid does not change after an action, you likely attempted an illegal move into 4s.\n* Favor routes marked by 3s; scan for 0/9 patches (generator) and confirm exit by nearby 5s; confirm the key by matching the bottom-left blueprint of 0s/9s.\n\n# EXAMPLE STRATEGY OBSERVATION\nThe 8×8 player (top rows 12s, bottom rows 9s) is flush against 4s on the left, so LEFT is blocked. I can see a 0/9 patch reachable via 3s to the right (likely the generator) and some 5s beyond it, so I should move RIGHT toward that corridor, cycling the key on the generator until the bottom-left key matches the one at the exit.\n\n# TURN:\nCall exactly one action.\n"

One Frame is made of one or more sequential\nGrids. Each Grid is a matrix size INT<0,63> by INT<0,63> filled with\nINT<0,15> values. Each value represents a different color and usually implies a different object.\n\nYou are playing a game called LockSmith.\n\n# CONTROLS\n* RESET: start over\n* ACTION1: move up\n* ACTION2: move down\n* ACTION3: move left\n* ACTION4: move right\n* ACTION5/ACTION6: no-ops\n\n# GOAL\nFind/generate a key that MATCHES the key pattern shown at the EXIT, then navigate to the EXIT to finish the level.\nThere are 6 levels total. Complete all levels to WIN.\n\n# TILE MEANINGS (important ones)\n* 0 = white cell (used in key patterns)\n* 3 = walkable path / corridor marker (often outlines routes to key/exit)\n* 4 = WALL (solid). You cannot enter 4s.\n* 5 = EXIT indicator (presence of 5s marks/frames the exit area)\n* 8 = LIFE token (count lives as the number of 2×2 blocks of 8s)\n* 9 = blue cells (used in player lower body; also appear elsewhere in the map and in key logic)\n* 12 = orange cells (used in player upper body)\n* 15 = MOVE counter (number of 15s ≈ moves/energy left)\n\n# PLAYER (sprite + movement legality)\n* The player is an 8×8 sprite made ONLY of 12s (top two rows) over 9s (bottom six rows).\n  - Concretely: rows 0–1 (relative to the sprite) are all 12s; rows 2–7 are all 9s.\n  - Other scattered 9s on the board are NOT the player—only the exact 8×8 (2×8 of 12s stacked on 6×8 of 9s) is the player.\n* Movement rules:\n  - You may move only through non-4 cells (i.e., never overlap a 4 after a move).\n  - If any part of your 8×8 sprite would overlap a 4 in the target direction (including cases where 4s lie “under” 9s), that move is ILLEGAL.\n  - If your sprite is already touching 4s on a side, you cannot move further in that touching direction until you have clearance.\n  - Practically: navigate corridors “between the 4s”.\n\n# KEYS, EXIT, AND HOW TO FIND THEM\n* The EXIT contains (or is adjacent to) the target key pattern and is marked by nearby 5s (it need not be fully surrounded; any 5s strongly indicate the exit region).\n* The bottom-left of the entire grid shows the REQUIRED KEY BLUEPRINT you must match: a specific layout of 0s (white) and 9s (blue).\n* Key generation mechanism (explicit):\n  - The KEY GENERATOR is a field/patch consisting of 0s and 9s that is NOT surrounded by 5s (i.e., not the exit).\n  - When any part of your 8×8 player walks onto this patch, a NEW candidate key is generated and displayed in the bottom-left.\n  - Step OFF the patch and then back ON to generate yet another candidate key; repeat to cycle through possibilities.\n  - You must keep cycling until the bottom-left candidate key EXACTLY matches the exit’s key (the same distribution of 0s and 9s seen within/adjacent to the 5s).\n* A reliable way to locate both the EXIT and the KEY GENERATOR area:\n  - Look for clusters of 0s and 9s reachable via 3s; if they are NOT framed by 5s, that area is most likely the generator. If you see 5s nearby framing a matching 0/9 pattern, that marks the exit.\n* When the pattern shown in the bottom-left matches the arrangement of 0s and 9s you see framed by (or adjacent to) 5s at the exit, move toward the 5s to complete the level.\n\n# HUD / PROGRESSION\n* Visual score on the second-to-last grid row (row 62): it contains several 4-cell “slots”.\n  - Slots made of 3s represent UNFINISHED levels.\n  - When a slot changes from 3s to another color, that level is COMPLETE.\n* Track remaining MOVES/ENERGY by counting tiles with value 15.\n* Track LIVES by counting distinct 2×2 blocks of 8s.\n\n# GENERAL NOTES\n* The grid is a bird’s-eye view.\n* If the grid does not change after an action, you likely attempted an illegal move into 4s.\n* Favor routes marked by 3s; scan for 0/9 patches (generator) and confirm exit by nearby 5s; confirm the key by matching the bottom-left blueprint of 0s/9s.\n\n# EXAMPLE STRATEGY OBSERVATION\nThe 8×8 player (top rows 12s, bottom rows 9s) is flush against 4s on the left, so LEFT is blocked. I can see a 0/9 patch reachable via 3s to the right (likely the generator) and some 5s beyond it, so I should move RIGHT toward that corridor, cycling the key on the generator until the bottom-left key matches the one at the exit.\n\n# TURN:\nCall exactly one action.\n"

One Frame is made of one or more sequential\nGrids. Each Grid is a matrix size INT<0,63> by INT<0,63> filled with\nINT<0,15> values. Each value represents a different color and usually implies a different object.\n\nYou are playing a game called LockSmith.\n\n# CONTROLS\n* RESET: start over\n* ACTION1: move up\n* ACTION2: move down\n* ACTION3: move left\n* ACTION4: move right\n* ACTION5/ACTION6: no-ops\n\n# GOAL\nFind/generate a key that MATCHES the key pattern shown at the EXIT, then navigate to the EXIT to finish the level.\nThere are 6 levels total. Complete all levels to WIN.\n\n# TILE MEANINGS (important ones)\n* 0 = white cell (used in key patterns)\n* 3 = walkable path / corridor marker (often outlines routes to key/exit)\n* 4 = WALL (solid). You cannot enter 4s.\n* 5 = EXIT indicator (presence of 5s marks/frames the exit area)\n* 8 = LIFE token (count lives as the number of 2×2 blocks of 8s)\n* 9 = blue cells (used in player lower body; also appear elsewhere in the map and in key logic)\n* 12 = orange cells (used in player upper body)\n* 15 = MOVE counter (number of 15s ≈ moves/energy left)\n\n# PLAYER (sprite + movement legality)\n* The player is an 8×8 sprite made ONLY of 12s (top two rows) over 9s (bottom six rows).\n  - Concretely: rows 0–1 (relative to the sprite) are all 12s; rows 2–7 are all 9s.\n  - Other scattered 9s on the board are NOT the player—only the exact 8×8 (2×8 of 12s stacked on 6×8 of 9s) is the player.\n* Movement rules:\n  - You may move only through non-4 cells (i.e., never overlap a 4 after a move).\n  - If any part of your 8×8 sprite would overlap a 4 in the target direction (including cases where 4s lie “under” 9s), that move is ILLEGAL.\n  - If your sprite is already touching 4s on a side, you cannot move further in that touching direction until you have clearance.\n  - Practically: navigate corridors “between the 4s”.\n\n# KEYS, EXIT, AND HOW TO FIND THEM\n* The EXIT contains (or is adjacent to) the target key pattern and is marked by nearby 5s (it need not be fully surrounded; any 5s strongly indicate the exit region).\n* The bottom-left of the entire grid shows the REQUIRED KEY BLUEPRINT you must match: a specific layout of 0s (white) and 9s (blue).\n* Key generation mechanism (explicit):\n  - The KEY GENERATOR is a field/patch consisting of 0s and 9s that is NOT surrounded by 5s (i.e., not the exit).\n  - When any part of your 8×8 player walks onto this patch, a NEW candidate key is generated and displayed in the bottom-left.\n  - Step OFF the patch and then back ON to generate yet another candidate key; repeat to cycle through possibilities.\n  - You must keep cycling until the bottom-left candidate key EXACTLY matches the exit’s key (the same distribution of 0s and 9s seen within/adjacent to the 5s).\n* A reliable way to locate both the EXIT and the KEY GENERATOR area:\n  - Look for clusters of 0s and 9s reachable via 3s; if they are NOT framed by 5s, that area is most likely the generator. If you see 5s nearby framing a matching 0/9 pattern, that marks the exit.\n* When the pattern shown in the bottom-left matches the arrangement of 0s and 9s you see framed by (or adjacent to) 5s at the exit, move toward the 5s to complete the level.\n\n# HUD / PROGRESSION\n* Visual score on the second-to-last grid row (row 62): it contains several 4-cell “slots”.\n  - Slots made of 3s represent UNFINISHED levels.\n  - When a slot changes from 3s to another color, that level is COMPLETE.\n* Track remaining MOVES/ENERGY by counting tiles with value 15.\n* Track LIVES by counting distinct 2×2 blocks of 8s.\n\n# GENERAL NOTES\n* The grid is a bird’s-eye view.\n* If the grid does not change after an action, you likely attempted an illegal move into 4s.\n* Favor routes marked by 3s; scan for 0/9 patches (generator) and confirm exit by nearby 5s; confirm the key by matching the bottom-left blueprint of 0s/9s.\n\n# EXAMPLE STRATEGY OBSERVATION\nThe 8×8 player (top rows 12s, bottom rows 9s) is flush against 4s on the left, so LEFT is blocked. I can see a 0/9 patch reachable via 3s to the right (likely the generator) and some 5s beyond it, so I should move RIGHT toward that corridor, cycling the key on the generator until the bottom-left key matches the one at the exit.\n\n# TURN:\nCall exactly one action.\n"

    "content": "\n# CONTEXT:\nYou are an agent playing a dynamic game. Your objective is to\nWIN and avoid GAME_OVER while minimizing actions.\n\nOne action produces one Frame. One Frame is made of one or more sequential\nGrids. Each Grid is a matrix size INT<0,63> by INT<0,63> filled with\nINT<0,15> values. Each value represents a different color and usually implies a different object.\n\nYou are playing a game called LockSmith.\n\n# CONTROLS\n* RESET: start over\n* ACTION1: move up\n* ACTION2: move down\n* ACTION3: move left\n* ACTION4: move right\n* ACTION5/ACTION6: no-ops\n\n# GOAL\nFind/generate a key that MATCHES the key pattern shown at the EXIT, then navigate to the EXIT to finish the level.\nThere are 6 levels total. Complete all levels to WIN.\n\n# TILE MEANINGS (important ones)\n* 0 = white cell (used in key patterns)\n* 3 = walkable path / corridor marker (often outlines routes to key/exit)\n* 4 = WALL (solid). You cannot enter 4s.\n* 5 = EXIT indicator (presence of 5s marks/frames the exit area)\n* 8 = LIFE token (count lives as the number of 2×2 blocks of 8s)\n* 9 = blue cells (used in player lower body; also appear elsewhere in the map and in key logic)\n* 12 = orange cells (used in player upper body)\n* 15 = MOVE counter (number of 15s ≈ moves/energy left)\n\n# PLAYER (sprite + movement legality)\n* The player is an 8×8 sprite made ONLY of 12s (top two rows) over 9s (bottom six rows).\n  - Concretely: rows 0–1 (relative to the sprite) are all 12s; rows 2–7 are all 9s.\n  - Other scattered 9s on the board are NOT the player—only the exact 8×8 (2×8 of 12s stacked on 6×8 of 9s) is the player.\n* Movement rules:\n  - You may move only through non-4 cells (i.e., never overlap a 4 after a move).\n  - If any part of your 8×8 sprite would overlap a 4 in the target direction (including cases where 4s lie “under” 9s), that move is ILLEGAL.\n  - If your sprite is already touching 4s on a side, you cannot move further in that touching direction until you have clearance.\n  - Practically: navigate corridors “between the 4s”.\n\n# KEYS, EXIT, AND HOW TO FIND THEM\n* The EXIT contains (or is adjacent to) the target key pattern and is marked by nearby 5s (it need not be fully surrounded; any 5s strongly indicate the exit region).\n* The bottom-left of the entire grid shows the REQUIRED KEY BLUEPRINT you must match: a specific layout of 0s (white) and 9s (blue).\n* Key generation mechanism (explicit):\n  - The KEY GENERATOR is a field/patch consisting of 0s and 9s that is NOT surrounded by 5s (i.e., not the exit).\n  - When any part of your 8×8 player walks onto this patch, a NEW candidate key is generated and displayed in the bottom-left.\n  - Step OFF the patch and then back ON to generate yet another candidate key; repeat to cycle through possibilities.\n  - You must keep cycling until the bottom-left candidate key EXACTLY matches the exit’s key (the same distribution of 0s and 9s seen within/adjacent to the 5s).\n* A reliable way to locate both the EXIT and the KEY GENERATOR area:\n  - Look for clusters of 0s and 9s reachable via 3s; if they are NOT framed by 5s, that area is most likely the generator. If you see 5s nearby framing a matching 0/9 pattern, that marks the exit.\n* When the pattern shown in the bottom-left matches the arrangement of 0s and 9s you see framed by (or adjacent to) 5s at the exit, move toward the 5s to complete the level.\n\n# HUD / PROGRESSION\n* Visual score on the second-to-last grid row (row 62): it contains several 4-cell “slots”.\n  - Slots made of 3s represent UNFINISHED levels.\n  - When a slot changes from 3s to another color, that level is COMPLETE.\n* Track remaining MOVES/ENERGY by counting tiles with value 15.\n* Track LIVES by counting distinct 2×2 blocks of 8s.\n\n# GENERAL NOTES\n* The grid is a bird’s-eye view.\n* If the grid does not change after an action, you likely attempted an illegal move into 4s.\n* Favor routes marked by 3s; scan for 0/9 patches (generator) and confirm exit by nearby 5s; confirm the key by matching the bottom-left blueprint of 0s/9s.\n\n# EXAMPLE STRATEGY OBSERVATION\nThe 8×8 player (top rows 12s, bottom rows 9s) is flush against 4s on the left, so LEFT is blocked. I can see a 0/9 patch reachable via 3s to the right (likely the generator) and some 5s beyond it, so I should move RIGHT toward that corridor, cycling the key on the generator until the bottom-left key matches the one at the exit.\n\n# TURN:\nCall exactly one action.\n"

    "content": "\n# CONTEXT:\nYou are an agent playing a dynamic game. Your objective is to\nWIN and avoid GAME_OVER while minimizing actions.\n\nOne action produces one Frame. One Frame is made of one or more sequential\nGrids. Each Grid is a matrix size INT<0,63> by INT<0,63> filled with\nINT<0,15> values. Each value represents a different color and usually implies a different object.\n\nYou are playing a game called LockSmith.\n\n# CONTROLS\n* RESET: start over\n* ACTION1: move up\n* ACTION2: move down\n* ACTION3: move left\n* ACTION4: move right\n* ACTION5/ACTION6: no-ops\n\n# GOAL\nFind/generate a key that MATCHES the key pattern shown at the EXIT, then navigate to the EXIT to finish the level.\nThere are 6 levels total. Complete all levels to WIN.\n\n# TILE MEANINGS (important ones)\n* 0 = white cell (used in key patterns)\n* 3 = walkable path / corridor marker (often outlines routes to key/exit)\n* 4 = WALL (solid). You cannot enter 4s.\n* 5 = EXIT indicator (presence of 5s marks/frames the exit area)\n* 8 = LIFE token (count lives as the number of 2×2 blocks of 8s)\n* 9 = blue cells (used in player lower body; also appear elsewhere in the map and in key logic)\n* 12 = orange cells (used in player upper body)\n* 15 = MOVE counter (number of 15s ≈ moves/energy left)\n\n# PLAYER (sprite + movement legality)\n* The player is an 8×8 sprite made ONLY of 12s (top two rows) over 9s (bottom six rows).\n  - Concretely: rows 0–1 (relative to the sprite) are all 12s; rows 2–7 are all 9s.\n  - Other scattered 9s on the board are NOT the player—only the exact 8×8 (2×8 of 12s stacked on 6×8 of 9s) is the player.\n* Movement rules:\n  - You may move only through non-4 cells (i.e., never overlap a 4 after a move).\n  - If any part of your 8×8 sprite would overlap a 4 in the target direction (including cases where 4s lie “under” 9s), that move is ILLEGAL.\n  - If your sprite is already touching 4s on a side, you cannot move further in that touching direction until you have clearance.\n  - Practically: navigate corridors “between the 4s”.\n\n# KEYS, EXIT, AND HOW TO FIND THEM\n* The EXIT contains (or is adjacent to) the target key pattern and is marked by nearby 5s (it need not be fully surrounded; any 5s strongly indicate the exit region).\n* The bottom-left of the entire grid shows the REQUIRED KEY BLUEPRINT you must match: a specific layout of 0s (white) and 9s (blue).\n* Key generation mechanism (explicit):\n  - The KEY GENERATOR is a field/patch consisting of 0s and 9s that is NOT surrounded by 5s (i.e., not the exit).\n  - When any part of your 8×8 player walks onto this patch, a NEW candidate key is generated and displayed in the bottom-left.\n  - Step OFF the patch and then back ON to generate yet another candidate key; repeat to cycle through possibilities.\n  - You must keep cycling until the bottom-left candidate key EXACTLY matches the exit’s key (the same distribution of 0s and 9s seen within/adjacent to the 5s).\n* A reliable way to locate both the EXIT and the KEY GENERATOR area:\n  - Look for clusters of 0s and 9s reachable via 3s; if they are NOT framed by 5s, that area is most likely the generator. If you see 5s nearby framing a matching 0/9 pattern, that marks the exit.\n* When the pattern shown in the bottom-left matches the arrangement of 0s and 9s you see framed by (or adjacent to) 5s at the exit, move toward the 5s to complete the level.\n\n# HUD / PROGRESSION\n* Visual score on the second-to-last grid row (row 62): it contains several 4-cell “slots”.\n  - Slots made of 3s represent UNFINISHED levels.\n  - When a slot changes from 3s to another color, that level is COMPLETE.\n* Track remaining MOVES/ENERGY by counting tiles with value 15.\n* Track LIVES by counting distinct 2×2 blocks of 8s.\n\n# GENERAL NOTES\n* The grid is a bird’s-eye view.\n* If the grid does not change after an action, you likely attempted an illegal move into 4s.\n* Favor routes marked by 3s; scan for 0/9 patches (generator) and confirm exit by nearby 5s; confirm the key by matching the bottom-left blueprint of 0s/9s.\n\n# EXAMPLE STRATEGY OBSERVATION\nThe 8×8 player (top rows 12s, bottom rows 9s) is flush against 4s on the left, so LEFT is blocked. I can see a 0/9 patch reachable via 3s to the right (likely the generator) and some 5s beyond it, so I should move RIGHT toward that corridor, cycling the key on the generator until the bottom-left key matches the one at the exit.\n\n# TURN:\nCall exactly one action.\n"

The goal is to cycle the generator until the bottom-left key matches the exit pattern, then move toward the 5s to finish.\n- Be mindful of the 4s when planning moves; ensure the 8×8 sprite can move without overlapping any 4s.\n\nPlan:\n- Navigate along available 3s toward the 0/9 generator patch.\n- Step onto the generator to cycle a candidate key, then step off and back on to cycle again.\n- Continue cycling until the bottom-left key exactly matches the exit blueprint, then approach the exit (the 5s) to complete the level."

    "content": "\n# CONTEXT:\nYou are an agent playing a dynamic game. Your objective is to\nWIN and avoid GAME_OVER while minimizing actions.\n\nOne action produces one Frame. One Frame is made of one or more sequential\nGrids. Each Grid is a matrix size INT<0,63> by INT<0,63> filled with\nINT<0,15> values. Each value represents a different color and usually implies a different object.\n\nYou are playing a game called LockSmith.\n\n# CONTROLS\n* RESET: start over\n* ACTION1: move up\n* ACTION2: move down\n* ACTION3: move left\n* ACTION4: move right\n* ACTION5/ACTION6: no-ops\n\n# GOAL\nFind/generate a key that MATCHES the key pattern shown at the EXIT, then navigate to the EXIT to finish the level.\nThere are 6 levels total. Complete all levels to WIN.\n\n# TILE MEANINGS (important ones)\n* 0 = white cell (used in key patterns)\n* 3 = walkable path / corridor marker (often outlines routes to key/exit)\n* 4 = WALL (solid). You cannot enter 4s.\n* 5 = EXIT indicator (presence of 5s marks/frames the exit area)\n* 8 = LIFE token (count lives as the number of 2×2 blocks of 8s)\n* 9 = blue cells (used in player lower body; also appear elsewhere in the map and in key logic)\n* 12 = orange cells (used in player upper body)\n* 15 = MOVE counter (number of 15s ≈ moves/energy left)\n\n# PLAYER (sprite + movement legality)\n* The player is an 8×8 sprite made ONLY of 12s (top two rows) over 9s (bottom six rows).\n  - Concretely: rows 0–1 (relative to the sprite) are all 12s; rows 2–7 are all 9s.\n  - Other scattered 9s on the board are NOT the player—only the exact 8×8 (2×8 of 12s stacked on 6×8 of 9s) is the player.\n* Movement rules:\n  - You may move only through non-4 cells (i.e., never overlap a 4 after a move).\n  - If any part of your 8×8 sprite would overlap a 4 in the target direction (including cases where 4s lie “under” 9s), that move is ILLEGAL.\n  - If your sprite is already touching 4s on a side, you cannot move further in that touching direction until you have clearance.\n  - Practically: navigate corridors “between the 4s”.\n\n# KEYS, EXIT, AND HOW TO FIND THEM\n* The EXIT contains (or is adjacent to) the target key pattern and is marked by nearby 5s (it need not be fully surrounded; any 5s strongly indicate the exit region).\n* The bottom-left of the entire grid shows the REQUIRED KEY BLUEPRINT you must match: a specific layout of 0s (white) and 9s (blue).\n* Key generation mechanism (explicit):\n  - The KEY GENERATOR is a field/patch consisting of 0s and 9s that is NOT surrounded by 5s (i.e., not the exit).\n  - When any part of your 8×8 player walks onto this patch, a NEW candidate key is generated and displayed in the bottom-left.\n  - Step OFF the patch and then back ON to generate yet another candidate key; repeat to cycle through possibilities.\n  - You must keep cycling until the bottom-left candidate key EXACTLY matches the exit’s key (the same distribution of 0s and 9s seen within/adjacent to the 5s).\n* A reliable way to locate both the EXIT and the KEY GENERATOR area:\n  - Look for clusters of 0s and 9s reachable via 3s; if they are NOT framed by 5s, that area is most likely the generator. If you see 5s nearby framing a matching 0/9 pattern, that marks the exit.\n* When the pattern shown in the bottom-left matches the arrangement of 0s and 9s you see framed by (or adjacent to) 5s at the exit, move toward the 5s to complete the level.\n\n# HUD / PROGRESSION\n* Visual score on the second-to-last grid row (row 62): it contains several 4-cell “slots”.\n  - Slots made of 3s represent UNFINISHED levels.\n  - When a slot changes from 3s to another color, that level is COMPLETE.\n* Track remaining MOVES/ENERGY by counting tiles with value 15.\n* Track LIVES by counting distinct 2×2 blocks of 8s.\n\n# GENERAL NOTES\n* The grid is a bird’s-eye view.\n* If the grid does not change after an action, you likely attempted an illegal move into 4s.\n* Favor routes marked by 3s; scan for 0/9 patches (generator) and confirm exit by nearby 5s; confirm the key by matching the bottom-left blueprint of 0s/9s.\n\n# EXAMPLE STRATEGY OBSERVATION\nThe 8×8 player (top rows 12s, bottom rows 9s) is flush against 4s on the left, so LEFT is blocked. I can see a 0/9 patch reachable via 3s to the right (likely the generator) and some 5s beyond it, so I should move RIGHT toward that corridor, cycling the key on the generator until the bottom-left key matches the one at the exit.\n\n# TURN:\nCall exactly one action.\n"

    "content": "\n# CONTEXT:\nYou are an agent playing a dynamic game. Your objective is to\nWIN and avoid GAME_OVER while minimizing actions.\n\nOne action produces one Frame. One Frame is made of one or more sequential\nGrids. Each Grid is a matrix size INT<0,63> by INT<0,63> filled with\nINT<0,15> values. Each value represents a different color and usually implies a different object.\n\nYou are playing a game called LockSmith.\n\n# CONTROLS\n* RESET: start over\n* ACTION1: move up\n* ACTION2: move down\n* ACTION3: move left\n* ACTION4: move right\n* ACTION5/ACTION6: no-ops\n\n# GOAL\nFind/generate a key that MATCHES the key pattern shown at the EXIT, then navigate to the EXIT to finish the level.\nThere are 6 levels total. Complete all levels to WIN.\n\n# TILE MEANINGS (important ones)\n* 0 = white cell (used in key patterns)\n* 3 = walkable path / corridor marker (often outlines routes to key/exit)\n* 4 = WALL (solid). You cannot enter 4s.\n* 5 = EXIT indicator (presence of 5s marks/frames the exit area)\n* 8 = LIFE token (count lives as the number of 2×2 blocks of 8s)\n* 9 = blue cells (used in player lower body; also appear elsewhere in the map and in key logic)\n* 12 = orange cells (used in player upper body)\n* 15 = MOVE counter (number of 15s ≈ moves/energy left)\n\n# PLAYER (sprite + movement legality)\n* The player is an 8×8 sprite made ONLY of 12s (top two rows) over 9s (bottom six rows).\n  - Concretely: rows 0–1 (relative to the sprite) are all 12s; rows 2–7 are all 9s.\n  - Other scattered 9s on the board are NOT the player—only the exact 8×8 (2×8 of 12s stacked on 6×8 of 9s) is the player.\n* Movement rules:\n  - You may move only through non-4 cells (i.e., never overlap a 4 after a move).\n  - If any part of your 8×8 sprite would overlap a 4 in the target direction (including cases where 4s lie “under” 9s), that move is ILLEGAL.\n  - If your sprite is already touching 4s on a side, you cannot move further in that touching direction until you have clearance.\n  - Practically: navigate corridors “between the 4s”.\n\n# KEYS, EXIT, AND HOW TO FIND THEM\n* The EXIT contains (or is adjacent to) the target key pattern and is marked by nearby 5s (it need not be fully surrounded; any 5s strongly indicate the exit region).\n* The bottom-left of the entire grid shows the REQUIRED KEY BLUEPRINT you must match: a specific layout of 0s (white) and 9s (blue).\n* Key generation mechanism (explicit):\n  - The KEY GENERATOR is a field/patch consisting of 0s and 9s that is NOT surrounded by 5s (i.e., not the exit).\n  - When any part of your 8×8 player walks onto this patch, a NEW candidate key is generated and displayed in the bottom-left.\n  - Step OFF the patch and then back ON to generate yet another candidate key; repeat to cycle through possibilities.\n  - You must keep cycling until the bottom-left candidate key EXACTLY matches the exit’s key (the same distribution of 0s and 9s seen within/adjacent to the 5s).\n* A reliable way to locate both the EXIT and the KEY GENERATOR area:\n  - Look for clusters of 0s and 9s reachable via 3s; if they are NOT framed by 5s, that area is most likely the generator. If you see 5s nearby framing a matching 0/9 pattern, that marks the exit.\n* When the pattern shown in the bottom-left matches the arrangement of 0s and 9s you see framed by (or adjacent to) 5s at the exit, move toward the 5s to complete the level.\n\n# HUD / PROGRESSION\n* Visual score on the second-to-last grid row (row 62): it contains several 4-cell “slots”.\n  - Slots made of 3s represent UNFINISHED levels.\n  - When a slot changes from 3s to another color, that level is COMPLETE.\n* Track remaining MOVES/ENERGY by counting tiles with value 15.\n* Track LIVES by counting distinct 2×2 blocks of 8s.\n\n# GENERAL NOTES\n* The grid is a bird’s-eye view.\n* If the grid does not change after an action, you likely attempted an illegal move into 4s.\n* Favor routes marked by 3s; scan for 0/9 patches (generator) and confirm exit by nearby 5s; confirm the key by matching the bottom-left blueprint of 0s/9s.\n\n# EXAMPLE STRATEGY OBSERVATION\nThe 8×8 player (top rows 12s, bottom rows 9s) is flush against 4s on the left, so LEFT is blocked. I can see a 0/9 patch reachable via 3s to the right (likely the generator) and some 5s beyond it, so I should move RIGHT toward that corridor, cycling the key on the generator until the bottom-left key matches the one at the exit.\n\n# TURN:\nCall exactly one action.\n"

    "content": "\n# CONTEXT:\nYou are an agent playing a dynamic game. Your objective is to\nWIN and avoid GAME_OVER while minimizing actions.\n\nOne action produces one Frame. One Frame is made of one or more sequential\nGrids. Each Grid is a matrix size INT<0,63> by INT<0,63> filled with\nINT<0,15> values. Each value represents a different color and usually implies a different object.\n\nYou are playing a game called LockSmith.\n\n# CONTROLS\n* RESET: start over\n* ACTION1: move up\n* ACTION2: move down\n* ACTION3: move left\n* ACTION4: move right\n* ACTION5/ACTION6: no-ops\n\n# GOAL\nFind/generate a key that MATCHES the key pattern shown at the EXIT, then navigate to the EXIT to finish the level.\nThere are 6 levels total. Complete all levels to WIN.\n\n# TILE MEANINGS (important ones)\n* 0 = white cell (used in key patterns)\n* 3 = walkable path / corridor marker (often outlines routes to key/exit)\n* 4 = WALL (solid). You cannot enter 4s.\n* 5 = EXIT indicator (presence of 5s marks/frames the exit area)\n* 8 = LIFE token (count lives as the number of 2×2 blocks of 8s)\n* 9 = blue cells (used in player lower body; also appear elsewhere in the map and in key logic)\n* 12 = orange cells (used in player upper body)\n* 15 = MOVE counter (number of 15s ≈ moves/energy left)\n\n# PLAYER (sprite + movement legality)\n* The player is an 8×8 sprite made ONLY of 12s (top two rows) over 9s (bottom six rows).\n  - Concretely: rows 0–1 (relative to the sprite) are all 12s; rows 2–7 are all 9s.\n  - Other scattered 9s on the board are NOT the player—only the exact 8×8 (2×8 of 12s stacked on 6×8 of 9s) is the player.\n* Movement rules:\n  - You may move only through non-4 cells (i.e., never overlap a 4 after a move).\n  - If any part of your 8×8 sprite would overlap a 4 in the target direction (including cases where 4s lie “under” 9s), that move is ILLEGAL.\n  - If your sprite is already touching 4s on a side, you cannot move further in that touching direction until you have clearance.\n  - Practically: navigate corridors “between the 4s”.\n\n# KEYS, EXIT, AND HOW TO FIND THEM\n* The EXIT contains (or is adjacent to) the target key pattern and is marked by nearby 5s (it need not be fully surrounded; any 5s strongly indicate the exit region).\n* The bottom-left of the entire grid shows the REQUIRED KEY BLUEPRINT you must match: a specific layout of 0s (white) and 9s (blue).\n* Key generation mechanism (explicit):\n  - The KEY GENERATOR is a field/patch consisting of 0s and 9s that is NOT surrounded by 5s (i.e., not the exit).\n  - When any part of your 8×8 player walks onto this patch, a NEW candidate key is generated and displayed in the bottom-left.\n  - Step OFF the patch and then back ON to generate yet another candidate key; repeat to cycle through possibilities.\n  - You must keep cycling until the bottom-left candidate key EXACTLY matches the exit’s key (the same distribution of 0s and 9s seen within/adjacent to the 5s).\n* A reliable way to locate both the EXIT and the KEY GENERATOR area:\n  - Look for clusters of 0s and 9s reachable via 3s; if they are NOT framed by 5s, that area is most likely the generator. If you see 5s nearby framing a matching 0/9 pattern, that marks the exit.\n* When the pattern shown in the bottom-left matches the arrangement of 0s and 9s you see framed by (or adjacent to) 5s at the exit, move toward the 5s to complete the level.\n\n# HUD / PROGRESSION\n* Visual score on the second-to-last grid row (row 62): it contains several 4-cell “slots”.\n  - Slots made of 3s represent UNFINISHED levels.\n  - When a slot changes from 3s to another color, that level is COMPLETE.\n* Track remaining MOVES/ENERGY by counting tiles with value 15.\n* Track LIVES by counting distinct 2×2 blocks of 8s.\n\n# GENERAL NOTES\n* The grid is a bird’s-eye view.\n* If the grid does not change after an action, you likely attempted an illegal move into 4s.\n* Favor routes marked by 3s; scan for 0/9 patches (generator) and confirm exit by nearby 5s; confirm the key by matching the bottom-left blueprint of 0s/9s.\n\n# EXAMPLE STRATEGY OBSERVATION\nThe 8×8 player (top rows 12s, bottom rows 9s) is flush against 4s on the left, so LEFT is blocked. I can see a 0/9 patch reachable via 3s to the right (likely the generator) and some 5s beyond it, so I should move RIGHT toward that corridor, cycling the key on the generator until the bottom-left key matches the one at the exit.\n\n# TURN:\nCall exactly one action.\n"

    "content": "\n# CONTEXT:\nYou are an agent playing a dynamic game. Your objective is to\nWIN and avoid GAME_OVER while minimizing actions.\n\nOne action produces one Frame. One Frame is made of one or more sequential\nGrids. Each Grid is a matrix size INT<0,63> by INT<0,63> filled with\nINT<0,15> values. Each value represents a different color and usually implies a different object.\n\nYou are playing a game called LockSmith.\n\n# CONTROLS\n* RESET: start over\n* ACTION1: move up\n* ACTION2: move down\n* ACTION3: move left\n* ACTION4: move right\n* ACTION5/ACTION6: no-ops\n\n# GOAL\nFind/generate a key that MATCHES the key pattern shown at the EXIT, then navigate to the EXIT to finish the level.\nThere are 6 levels total. Complete all levels to WIN.\n\n# TILE MEANINGS (important ones)\n* 0 = white cell (used in key patterns)\n* 3 = walkable path / corridor marker (often outlines routes to key/exit)\n* 4 = WALL (solid). You cannot enter 4s.\n* 5 = EXIT indicator (presence of 5s marks/frames the exit area)\n* 8 = LIFE token (count lives as the number of 2×2 blocks of 8s)\n* 9 = blue cells (used in player lower body; also appear elsewhere in the map and in key logic)\n* 12 = orange cells (used in player upper body)\n* 15 = MOVE counter (number of 15s ≈ moves/energy left)\n\n# PLAYER (sprite + movement legality)\n* The player is an 8×8 sprite made ONLY of 12s (top two rows) over 9s (bottom six rows).\n  - Concretely: rows 0–1 (relative to the sprite) are all 12s; rows 2–7 are all 9s.\n  - Other scattered 9s on the board are NOT the player—only the exact 8×8 (2×8 of 12s stacked on 6×8 of 9s) is the player.\n* Movement rules:\n  - You may move only through non-4 cells (i.e., never overlap a 4 after a move).\n  - If any part of your 8×8 sprite would overlap a 4 in the target direction (including cases where 4s lie “under” 9s), that move is ILLEGAL.\n  - If your sprite is already touching 4s on a side, you cannot move further in that touching direction until you have clearance.\n  - Practically: navigate corridors “between the 4s”.\n\n# KEYS, EXIT, AND HOW TO FIND THEM\n* The EXIT contains (or is adjacent to) the target key pattern and is marked by nearby 5s (it need not be fully surrounded; any 5s strongly indicate the exit region).\n* The bottom-left of the entire grid shows the REQUIRED KEY BLUEPRINT you must match: a specific layout of 0s (white) and 9s (blue).\n* Key generation mechanism (explicit):\n  - The KEY GENERATOR is a field/patch consisting of 0s and 9s that is NOT surrounded by 5s (i.e., not the exit).\n  - When any part of your 8×8 player walks onto this patch, a NEW candidate key is generated and displayed in the bottom-left.\n  - Step OFF the patch and then back ON to generate yet another candidate key; repeat to cycle through possibilities.\n  - You must keep cycling until the bottom-left candidate key EXACTLY matches the exit’s key (the same distribution of 0s and 9s seen within/adjacent to the 5s).\n* A reliable way to locate both the EXIT and the KEY GENERATOR area:\n  - Look for clusters of 0s and 9s reachable via 3s; if they are NOT framed by 5s, that area is most likely the generator. If you see 5s nearby framing a matching 0/9 pattern, that marks the exit.\n* When the pattern shown in the bottom-left matches the arrangement of 0s and 9s you see framed by (or adjacent to) 5s at the exit, move toward the 5s to complete the level.\n\n# HUD / PROGRESSION\n* Visual score on the second-to-last grid row (row 62): it contains several 4-cell “slots”.\n  - Slots made of 3s represent UNFINISHED levels.\n  - When a slot changes from 3s to another color, that level is COMPLETE.\n* Track remaining MOVES/ENERGY by counting tiles with value 15.\n* Track LIVES by counting distinct 2×2 blocks of 8s.\n\n# GENERAL NOTES\n* The grid is a bird’s-eye view.\n* If the grid does not change after an action, you likely attempted an illegal move into 4s.\n* Favor routes marked by 3s; scan for 0/9 patches (generator) and confirm exit by nearby 5s; confirm the key by matching the bottom-left blueprint of 0s/9s.\n\n# EXAMPLE STRATEGY OBSERVATION\nThe 8×8 player (top rows 12s, bottom rows 9s) is flush against 4s on the left, so LEFT is blocked. I can see a 0/9 patch reachable via 3s to the right (likely the generator) and some 5s beyond it, so I should move RIGHT toward that corridor, cycling the key on the generator until the bottom-left key matches the one at the exit.\n\n# TURN:\nCall exactly one action.\n"

Step off the patch, then step back on to cycle to the next candidate. Repeat until the bottom-left key blueprint exactly matches the exit’s blueprint (as seen near the 5s).\n- Once a matching key appears, move toward the 5s/exit area to complete the level, while avoiding any move that would overlap a 4. Keep an eye on energy (15s) and any life indicators (8s)."

    "content": "\n# CONTEXT:\nYou are an agent playing a dynamic game. Your objective is to\nWIN and avoid GAME_OVER while minimizing actions.\n\nOne action produces one Frame. One Frame is made of one or more sequential\nGrids. Each Grid is a matrix size INT<0,63> by INT<0,63> filled with\nINT<0,15> values. Each value represents a different color and usually implies a different object.\n\nYou are playing a game called LockSmith.\n\n# CONTROLS\n* RESET: start over\n* ACTION1: move up\n* ACTION2: move down\n* ACTION3: move left\n* ACTION4: move right\n* ACTION5/ACTION6: no-ops\n\n# GOAL\nFind/generate a key that MATCHES the key pattern shown at the EXIT, then navigate to the EXIT to finish the level.\nThere are 6 levels total. Complete all levels to WIN.\n\n# TILE MEANINGS (important ones)\n* 0 = white cell (used in key patterns)\n* 3 = walkable path / corridor marker (often outlines routes to key/exit)\n* 4 = WALL (solid). You cannot enter 4s.\n* 5 = EXIT indicator (presence of 5s marks/frames the exit area)\n* 8 = LIFE token (count lives as the number of 2×2 blocks of 8s)\n* 9 = blue cells (used in player lower body; also appear elsewhere in the map and in key logic)\n* 12 = orange cells (used in player upper body)\n* 15 = MOVE counter (number of 15s ≈ moves/energy left)\n\n# PLAYER (sprite + movement legality)\n* The player is an 8×8 sprite made ONLY of 12s (top two rows) over 9s (bottom six rows).\n  - Concretely: rows 0–1 (relative to the sprite) are all 12s; rows 2–7 are all 9s.\n  - Other scattered 9s on the board are NOT the player—only the exact 8×8 (2×8 of 12s stacked on 6×8 of 9s) is the player.\n* Movement rules:\n  - You may move only through non-4 cells (i.e., never overlap a 4 after a move).\n  - If any part of your 8×8 sprite would overlap a 4 in the target direction (including cases where 4s lie “under” 9s), that move is ILLEGAL.\n  - If your sprite is already touching 4s on a side, you cannot move further in that touching direction until you have clearance.\n  - Practically: navigate corridors “between the 4s”.\n\n# KEYS, EXIT, AND HOW TO FIND THEM\n* The EXIT contains (or is adjacent to) the target key pattern and is marked by nearby 5s (it need not be fully surrounded; any 5s strongly indicate the exit region).\n* The bottom-left of the entire grid shows the REQUIRED KEY BLUEPRINT you must match: a specific layout of 0s (white) and 9s (blue).\n* Key generation mechanism (explicit):\n  - The KEY GENERATOR is a field/patch consisting of 0s and 9s that is NOT surrounded by 5s (i.e., not the exit).\n  - When any part of your 8×8 player walks onto this patch, a NEW candidate key is generated and displayed in the bottom-left.\n  - Step OFF the patch and then back ON to generate yet another candidate key; repeat to cycle through possibilities.\n  - You must keep cycling until the bottom-left candidate key EXACTLY matches the exit’s key (the same distribution of 0s and 9s seen within/adjacent to the 5s).\n* A reliable way to locate both the EXIT and the KEY GENERATOR area:\n  - Look for clusters of 0s and 9s reachable via 3s; if they are NOT framed by 5s, that area is most likely the generator. If you see 5s nearby framing a matching 0/9 pattern, that marks the exit.\n* When the pattern shown in the bottom-left matches the arrangement of 0s and 9s you see framed by (or adjacent to) 5s at the exit, move toward the 5s to complete the level.\n\n# HUD / PROGRESSION\n* Visual score on the second-to-last grid row (row 62): it contains several 4-cell “slots”.\n  - Slots made of 3s represent UNFINISHED levels.\n  - When a slot changes from 3s to another color, that level is COMPLETE.\n* Track remaining MOVES/ENERGY by counting tiles with value 15.\n* Track LIVES by counting distinct 2×2 blocks of 8s.\n\n# GENERAL NOTES\n* The grid is a bird’s-eye view.\n* If the grid does not change after an action, you likely attempted an illegal move into 4s.\n* Favor routes marked by 3s; scan for 0/9 patches (generator) and confirm exit by nearby 5s; confirm the key by matching the bottom-left blueprint of 0s/9s.\n\n# EXAMPLE STRATEGY OBSERVATION\nThe 8×8 player (top rows 12s, bottom rows 9s) is flush against 4s on the left, so LEFT is blocked. I can see a 0/9 patch reachable via 3s to the right (likely the generator) and some 5s beyond it, so I should move RIGHT toward that corridor, cycling the key on the generator until the bottom-left key matches the one at the exit.\n\n# TURN:\nCall exactly one action.\n"

    "content": "\n# CONTEXT:\nYou are an agent playing a dynamic game. Your objective is to\nWIN and avoid GAME_OVER while minimizing actions.\n\nOne action produces one Frame. One Frame is made of one or more sequential\nGrids. Each Grid is a matrix size INT<0,63> by INT<0,63> filled with\nINT<0,15> values. Each value represents a different color and usually implies a different object.\n\nYou are playing a game called LockSmith.\n\n# CONTROLS\n* RESET: start over\n* ACTION1: move up\n* ACTION2: move down\n* ACTION3: move left\n* ACTION4: move right\n* ACTION5/ACTION6: no-ops\n\n# GOAL\nFind/generate a key that MATCHES the key pattern shown at the EXIT, then navigate to the EXIT to finish the level.\nThere are 6 levels total. Complete all levels to WIN.\n\n# TILE MEANINGS (important ones)\n* 0 = white cell (used in key patterns)\n* 3 = walkable path / corridor marker (often outlines routes to key/exit)\n* 4 = WALL (solid). You cannot enter 4s.\n* 5 = EXIT indicator (presence of 5s marks/frames the exit area)\n* 8 = LIFE token (count lives as the number of 2×2 blocks of 8s)\n* 9 = blue cells (used in player lower body; also appear elsewhere in the map and in key logic)\n* 12 = orange cells (used in player upper body)\n* 15 = MOVE counter (number of 15s ≈ moves/energy left)\n\n# PLAYER (sprite + movement legality)\n* The player is an 8×8 sprite made ONLY of 12s (top two rows) over 9s (bottom six rows).\n  - Concretely: rows 0–1 (relative to the sprite) are all 12s; rows 2–7 are all 9s.\n  - Other scattered 9s on the board are NOT the player—only the exact 8×8 (2×8 of 12s stacked on 6×8 of 9s) is the player.\n* Movement rules:\n  - You may move only through non-4 cells (i.e., never overlap a 4 after a move).\n  - If any part of your 8×8 sprite would overlap a 4 in the target direction (including cases where 4s lie “under” 9s), that move is ILLEGAL.\n  - If your sprite is already touching 4s on a side, you cannot move further in that touching direction until you have clearance.\n  - Practically: navigate corridors “between the 4s”.\n\n# KEYS, EXIT, AND HOW TO FIND THEM\n* The EXIT contains (or is adjacent to) the target key pattern and is marked by nearby 5s (it need not be fully surrounded; any 5s strongly indicate the exit region).\n* The bottom-left of the entire grid shows the REQUIRED KEY BLUEPRINT you must match: a specific layout of 0s (white) and 9s (blue).\n* Key generation mechanism (explicit):\n  - The KEY GENERATOR is a field/patch consisting of 0s and 9s that is NOT surrounded by 5s (i.e., not the exit).\n  - When any part of your 8×8 player walks onto this patch, a NEW candidate key is generated and displayed in the bottom-left.\n  - Step OFF the patch and then back ON to generate yet another candidate key; repeat to cycle through possibilities.\n  - You must keep cycling until the bottom-left candidate key EXACTLY matches the exit’s key (the same distribution of 0s and 9s seen within/adjacent to the 5s).\n* A reliable way to locate both the EXIT and the KEY GENERATOR area:\n  - Look for clusters of 0s and 9s reachable via 3s; if they are NOT framed by 5s, that area is most likely the generator. If you see 5s nearby framing a matching 0/9 pattern, that marks the exit.\n* When the pattern shown in the bottom-left matches the arrangement of 0s and 9s you see framed by (or adjacent to) 5s at the exit, move toward the 5s to complete the level.\n\n# HUD / PROGRESSION\n* Visual score on the second-to-last grid row (row 62): it contains several 4-cell “slots”.\n  - Slots made of 3s represent UNFINISHED levels.\n  - When a slot changes from 3s to another color, that level is COMPLETE.\n* Track remaining MOVES/ENERGY by counting tiles with value 15.\n* Track LIVES by counting distinct 2×2 blocks of 8s.\n\n# GENERAL NOTES\n* The grid is a bird’s-eye view.\n* If the grid does not change after an action, you likely attempted an illegal move into 4s.\n* Favor routes marked by 3s; scan for 0/9 patches (generator) and confirm exit by nearby 5s; confirm the key by matching the bottom-left blueprint of 0s/9s.\n\n# EXAMPLE STRATEGY OBSERVATION\nThe 8×8 player (top rows 12s, bottom rows 9s) is flush against 4s on the left, so LEFT is blocked. I can see a 0/9 patch reachable via 3s to the right (likely the generator) and some 5s beyond it, so I should move RIGHT toward that corridor, cycling the key on the generator until the bottom-left key matches the one at the exit.\n\n# TURN:\nCall exactly one action.\n"

Step off the patch, then step back on to cycle to the next candidate. Repeat until the bottom-left key blueprint exactly matches the exit’s blueprint (as seen near the 5s).\n- Once a matching key appears, move toward the 5s/exit area to complete the level, while avoiding any move that would overlap a 4.

    "content": "\n# CONTEXT:\nYou are an agent playing a dynamic game. Your objective is to\nWIN and avoid GAME_OVER while minimizing actions.\n\nOne action produces one Frame. One Frame is made of one or more sequential\nGrids. Each Grid is a matrix size INT<0,63> by INT<0,63> filled with\nINT<0,15> values. Each value represents a different color and usually implies a different object.\n\nYou are playing a game called LockSmith.\n\n# CONTROLS\n* RESET: start over\n* ACTION1: move up\n* ACTION2: move down\n* ACTION3: move left\n* ACTION4: move right\n* ACTION5/ACTION6: no-ops\n\n# GOAL\nFind/generate a key that MATCHES the key pattern shown at the EXIT, then navigate to the EXIT to finish the level.\nThere are 6 levels total. Complete all levels to WIN.\n\n# TILE MEANINGS (important ones)\n* 0 = white cell (used in key patterns)\n* 3 = walkable path / corridor marker (often outlines routes to key/exit)\n* 4 = WALL (solid). You cannot enter 4s.\n* 5 = EXIT indicator (presence of 5s marks/frames the exit area)\n* 8 = LIFE token (count lives as the number of 2×2 blocks of 8s)\n* 9 = blue cells (used in player lower body; also appear elsewhere in the map and in key logic)\n* 12 = orange cells (used in player upper body)\n* 15 = MOVE counter (number of 15s ≈ moves/energy left)\n\n# PLAYER (sprite + movement legality)\n* The player is an 8×8 sprite made ONLY of 12s (top two rows) over 9s (bottom six rows).\n  - Concretely: rows 0–1 (relative to the sprite) are all 12s; rows 2–7 are all 9s.\n  - Other scattered 9s on the board are NOT the player—only the exact 8×8 (2×8 of 12s stacked on 6×8 of 9s) is the player.\n* Movement rules:\n  - You may move only through non-4 cells (i.e., never overlap a 4 after a move).\n  - If any part of your 8×8 sprite would overlap a 4 in the target direction (including cases where 4s lie “under” 9s), that move is ILLEGAL.\n  - If your sprite is already touching 4s on a side, you cannot move further in that touching direction until you have clearance.\n  - Practically: navigate corridors “between the 4s”.\n\n# KEYS, EXIT, AND HOW TO FIND THEM\n* The EXIT contains (or is adjacent to) the target key pattern and is marked by nearby 5s (it need not be fully surrounded; any 5s strongly indicate the exit region).\n* The bottom-left of the entire grid shows the REQUIRED KEY BLUEPRINT you must match: a specific layout of 0s (white) and 9s (blue).\n* Key generation mechanism (explicit):\n  - The KEY GENERATOR is a field/patch consisting of 0s and 9s that is NOT surrounded by 5s (i.e., not the exit).\n  - When any part of your 8×8 player walks onto this patch, a NEW candidate key is generated and displayed in the bottom-left.\n  - Step OFF the patch and then back ON to generate yet another candidate key; repeat to cycle through possibilities.\n  - You must keep cycling until the bottom-left candidate key EXACTLY matches the exit’s key (the same distribution of 0s and 9s seen within/adjacent to the 5s).\n* A reliable way to locate both the EXIT and the KEY GENERATOR area:\n  - Look for clusters of 0s and 9s reachable via 3s; if they are NOT framed by 5s, that area is most likely the generator. If you see 5s nearby framing a matching 0/9 pattern, that marks the exit.\n* When the pattern shown in the bottom-left matches the arrangement of 0s and 9s you see framed by (or adjacent to) 5s at the exit, move toward the 5s to complete the level.\n\n# HUD / PROGRESSION\n* Visual score on the second-to-last grid row (row 62): it contains several 4-cell “slots”.\n  - Slots made of 3s represent UNFINISHED levels.\n  - When a slot changes from 3s to another color, that level is COMPLETE.\n* Track remaining MOVES/ENERGY by counting tiles with value 15.\n* Track LIVES by counting distinct 2×2 blocks of 8s.\n\n# GENERAL NOTES\n* The grid is a bird’s-eye view.\n* If the grid does not change after an action, you likely attempted an illegal move into 4s.\n* Favor routes marked by 3s; scan for 0/9 patches (generator) and confirm exit by nearby 5s; confirm the key by matching the bottom-left blueprint of 0s/9s.\n\n# EXAMPLE STRATEGY OBSERVATION\nThe 8×8 player (top rows 12s, bottom rows 9s) is flush against 4s on the left, so LEFT is blocked. I can see a 0/9 patch reachable via 3s to the right (likely the generator) and some 5s beyond it, so I should move RIGHT toward that corridor, cycling the key on the generator until the bottom-left key matches the one at the exit.\n\n# TURN:\nCall exactly one action.\n"

    "content": "\n# CONTEXT:\nYou are an agent playing a dynamic game. Your objective is to\nWIN and avoid GAME_OVER while minimizing actions.\n\nOne action produces one Frame. One Frame is made of one or more sequential\nGrids. Each Grid is a matrix size INT<0,63> by INT<0,63> filled with\nINT<0,15> values. Each value represents a different color and usually implies a different object.\n\nYou are playing a game called LockSmith.\n\n# CONTROLS\n* RESET: start over\n* ACTION1: move up\n* ACTION2: move down\n* ACTION3: move left\n* ACTION4: move right\n* ACTION5/ACTION6: no-ops\n\n# GOAL\nFind/generate a key that MATCHES the key pattern shown at the EXIT, then navigate to the EXIT to finish the level.\nThere are 6 levels total. Complete all levels to WIN.\n\n# TILE MEANINGS (important ones)\n* 0 = white cell (used in key patterns)\n* 3 = walkable path / corridor marker (often outlines routes to key/exit)\n* 4 = WALL (solid). You cannot enter 4s.\n* 5 = EXIT indicator (presence of 5s marks/frames the exit area)\n* 8 = LIFE token (count lives as the number of 2×2 blocks of 8s)\n* 9 = blue cells (used in player lower body; also appear elsewhere in the map and in key logic)\n* 12 = orange cells (used in player upper body)\n* 15 = MOVE counter (number of 15s ≈ moves/energy left)\n\n# PLAYER (sprite + movement legality)\n* The player is an 8×8 sprite made ONLY of 12s (top two rows) over 9s (bottom six rows).\n  - Concretely: rows 0–1 (relative to the sprite) are all 12s; rows 2–7 are all 9s.\n  - Other scattered 9s on the board are NOT the player—only the exact 8×8 (2×8 of 12s stacked on 6×8 of 9s) is the player.\n* Movement rules:\n  - You may move only through non-4 cells (i.e., never overlap a 4 after a move).\n  - If any part of your 8×8 sprite would overlap a 4 in the target direction (including cases where 4s lie “under” 9s), that move is ILLEGAL.\n  - If your sprite is already touching 4s on a side, you cannot move further in that touching direction until you have clearance.\n  - Practically: navigate corridors “between the 4s”.\n\n# KEYS, EXIT, AND HOW TO FIND THEM\n* The EXIT contains (or is adjacent to) the target key pattern and is marked by nearby 5s (it need not be fully surrounded; any 5s strongly indicate the exit region).\n* The bottom-left of the entire grid shows the REQUIRED KEY BLUEPRINT you must match: a specific layout of 0s (white) and 9s (blue).\n* Key generation mechanism (explicit):\n  - The KEY GENERATOR is a field/patch consisting of 0s and 9s that is NOT surrounded by 5s (i.e., not the exit).\n  - When any part of your 8×8 player walks onto this patch, a NEW candidate key is generated and displayed in the bottom-left.\n  - Step OFF the patch and then back ON to generate yet another candidate key; repeat to cycle through possibilities.\n  - You must keep cycling until the bottom-left candidate key EXACTLY matches the exit’s key (the same distribution of 0s and 9s seen within/adjacent to the 5s).\n* A reliable way to locate both the EXIT and the KEY GENERATOR area:\n  - Look for clusters of 0s and 9s reachable via 3s; if they are NOT framed by 5s, that area is most likely the generator. If you see 5s nearby framing a matching 0/9 pattern, that marks the exit.\n* When the pattern shown in the bottom-left matches the arrangement of 0s and 9s you see framed by (or adjacent to) 5s at the exit, move toward the 5s to complete the level.\n\n# HUD / PROGRESSION\n* Visual score on the second-to-last grid row (row 62): it contains several 4-cell “slots”.\n  - Slots made of 3s represent UNFINISHED levels.\n  - When a slot changes from 3s to another color, that level is COMPLETE.\n* Track remaining MOVES/ENERGY by counting tiles with value 15.\n* Track LIVES by counting distinct 2×2 blocks of 8s.\n\n# GENERAL NOTES\n* The grid is a bird’s-eye view.\n* If the grid does not change after an action, you likely attempted an illegal move into 4s.\n* Favor routes marked by 3s; scan for 0/9 patches (generator) and confirm exit by nearby 5s; confirm the key by matching the bottom-left blueprint of 0s/9s.\n\n# EXAMPLE STRATEGY OBSERVATION\nThe 8×8 player (top rows 12s, bottom rows 9s) is flush against 4s on the left, so LEFT is blocked. I can see a 0/9 patch reachable via 3s to the right (likely the generator) and some 5s beyond it, so I should move RIGHT toward that corridor, cycling the key on the generator until the bottom-left key matches the one at the exit.\n\n# TURN:\nCall exactly one action.\n"

    "content": "\n# CONTEXT:\nYou are an agent playing a dynamic game. Your objective is to\nWIN and avoid GAME_OVER while minimizing actions.\n\nOne action produces one Frame. One Frame is made of one or more sequential\nGrids. Each Grid is a matrix size INT<0,63> by INT<0,63> filled with\nINT<0,15> values. Each value represents a different color and usually implies a different object.\n\nYou are playing a game called LockSmith.\n\n# CONTROLS\n* RESET: start over\n* ACTION1: move up\n* ACTION2: move down\n* ACTION3: move left\n* ACTION4: move right\n* ACTION5/ACTION6: no-ops\n\n# GOAL\nFind/generate a key that MATCHES the key pattern shown at the EXIT, then navigate to the EXIT to finish the level.\nThere are 6 levels total. Complete all levels to WIN.\n\n# TILE MEANINGS (important ones)\n* 0 = white cell (used in key patterns)\n* 3 = walkable path / corridor marker (often outlines routes to key/exit)\n* 4 = WALL (solid). You cannot enter 4s.\n* 5 = EXIT indicator (presence of 5s marks/frames the exit area)\n* 8 = LIFE token (count lives as the number of 2×2 blocks of 8s)\n* 9 = blue cells (used in player lower body; also appear elsewhere in the map and in key logic)\n* 12 = orange cells (used in player upper body)\n* 15 = MOVE counter (number of 15s ≈ moves/energy left)\n\n# PLAYER (sprite + movement legality)\n* The player is an 8×8 sprite made ONLY of 12s (top two rows) over 9s (bottom six rows).\n  - Concretely: rows 0–1 (relative to the sprite) are all 12s; rows 2–7 are all 9s.\n  - Other scattered 9s on the board are NOT the player—only the exact 8×8 (2×8 of 12s stacked on 6×8 of 9s) is the player.\n* Movement rules:\n  - You may move only through non-4 cells (i.e., never overlap a 4 after a move).\n  - If any part of your 8×8 sprite would overlap a 4 in the target direction (including cases where 4s lie “under” 9s), that move is ILLEGAL.\n  - If your sprite is already touching 4s on a side, you cannot move further in that touching direction until you have clearance.\n  - Practically: navigate corridors “between the 4s”.\n\n# KEYS, EXIT, AND HOW TO FIND THEM\n* The EXIT contains (or is adjacent to) the target key pattern and is marked by nearby 5s (it need not be fully surrounded; any 5s strongly indicate the exit region).\n* The bottom-left of the entire grid shows the REQUIRED KEY BLUEPRINT you must match: a specific layout of 0s (white) and 9s (blue).\n* Key generation mechanism (explicit):\n  - The KEY GENERATOR is a field/patch consisting of 0s and 9s that is NOT surrounded by 5s (i.e., not the exit).\n  - When any part of your 8×8 player walks onto this patch, a NEW candidate key is generated and displayed in the bottom-left.\n  - Step OFF the patch and then back ON to generate yet another candidate key; repeat to cycle through possibilities.\n  - You must keep cycling until the bottom-left candidate key EXACTLY matches the exit’s key (the same distribution of 0s and 9s seen within/adjacent to the 5s).\n* A reliable way to locate both the EXIT and the KEY GENERATOR area:\n  - Look for clusters of 0s and 9s reachable via 3s; if they are NOT framed by 5s, that area is most likely the generator. If you see 5s nearby framing a matching 0/9 pattern, that marks the exit.\n* When the pattern shown in the bottom-left matches the arrangement of 0s and 9s you see framed by (or adjacent to) 5s at the exit, move toward the 5s to complete the level.\n\n# HUD / PROGRESSION\n* Visual score on the second-to-last grid row (row 62): it contains several 4-cell “slots”.\n  - Slots made of 3s represent UNFINISHED levels.\n  - When a slot changes from 3s to another color, that level is COMPLETE.\n* Track remaining MOVES/ENERGY by counting tiles with value 15.\n* Track LIVES by counting distinct 2×2 blocks of 8s.\n\n# GENERAL NOTES\n* The grid is a bird’s-eye view.\n* If the grid does not change after an action, you likely attempted an illegal move into 4s.\n* Favor routes marked by 3s; scan for 0/9 patches (generator) and confirm exit by nearby 5s; confirm the key by matching the bottom-left blueprint of 0s/9s.\n\n# EXAMPLE STRATEGY OBSERVATION\nThe 8×8 player (top rows 12s, bottom rows 9s) is flush against 4s on the left, so LEFT is blocked. I can see a 0/9 patch reachable via 3s to the right (likely the generator) and some 5s beyond it, so I should move RIGHT toward that corridor, cycling the key on the generator until the bottom-left key matches the one at the exit.\n\n# TURN:\nCall exactly one action.\n"

    "content": "\n# CONTEXT:\nYou are an agent playing a dynamic game. Your objective is to\nWIN and avoid GAME_OVER while minimizing actions.\n\nOne action produces one Frame. One Frame is made of one or more sequential\nGrids. Each Grid is a matrix size INT<0,63> by INT<0,63> filled with\nINT<0,15> values. Each value represents a different color and usually implies a different object.\n\nYou are playing a game called LockSmith.\n\n# CONTROLS\n* RESET: start over\n* ACTION1: move up\n* ACTION2: move down\n* ACTION3: move left\n* ACTION4: move right\n* ACTION5/ACTION6: no-ops\n\n# GOAL\nFind/generate a key that MATCHES the key pattern shown at the EXIT, then navigate to the EXIT to finish the level.\nThere are 6 levels total. Complete all levels to WIN.\n\n# TILE MEANINGS (important ones)\n* 0 = white cell (used in key patterns)\n* 3 = walkable path / corridor marker (often outlines routes to key/exit)\n* 4 = WALL (solid). You cannot enter 4s.\n* 5 = EXIT indicator (presence of 5s marks/frames the exit area)\n* 8 = LIFE token (count lives as the number of 2×2 blocks of 8s)\n* 9 = blue cells (used in player lower body; also appear elsewhere in the map and in key logic)\n* 12 = orange cells (used in player upper body)\n* 15 = MOVE counter (number of 15s ≈ moves/energy left)\n\n# PLAYER (sprite + movement legality)\n* The player is an 8×8 sprite made ONLY of 12s (top two rows) over 9s (bottom six rows).\n  - Concretely: rows 0–1 (relative to the sprite) are all 12s; rows 2–7 are all 9s.\n  - Other scattered 9s on the board are NOT the player—only the exact 8×8 (2×8 of 12s stacked on 6×8 of 9s) is the player.\n* Movement rules:\n  - You may move only through non-4 cells (i.e., never overlap a 4 after a move).\n  - If any part of your 8×8 sprite would overlap a 4 in the target direction (including cases where 4s lie “under” 9s), that move is ILLEGAL.\n  - If your sprite is already touching 4s on a side, you cannot move further in that touching direction until you have clearance.\n  - Practically: navigate corridors “between the 4s”.\n\n# KEYS, EXIT, AND HOW TO FIND THEM\n* The EXIT contains (or is adjacent to) the target key pattern and is marked by nearby 5s (it need not be fully surrounded; any 5s strongly indicate the exit region).\n* The bottom-left of the entire grid shows the REQUIRED KEY BLUEPRINT you must match: a specific layout of 0s (white) and 9s (blue).\n* Key generation mechanism (explicit):\n  - The KEY GENERATOR is a field/patch consisting of 0s and 9s that is NOT surrounded by 5s (i.e., not the exit).\n  - When any part of your 8×8 player walks onto this patch, a NEW candidate key is generated and displayed in the bottom-left.\n  - Step OFF the patch and then back ON to generate yet another candidate key; repeat to cycle through possibilities.\n  - You must keep cycling until the bottom-left candidate key EXACTLY matches the exit’s key (the same distribution of 0s and 9s seen within/adjacent to the 5s).\n* A reliable way to locate both the EXIT and the KEY GENERATOR area:\n  - Look for clusters of 0s and 9s reachable via 3s; if they are NOT framed by 5s, that area is most likely the generator. If you see 5s nearby framing a matching 0/9 pattern, that marks the exit.\n* When the pattern shown in the bottom-left matches the arrangement of 0s and 9s you see framed by (or adjacent to) 5s at the exit, move toward the 5s to complete the level.\n\n# HUD / PROGRESSION\n* Visual score on the second-to-last grid row (row 62): it contains several 4-cell “slots”.\n  - Slots made of 3s represent UNFINISHED levels.\n  - When a slot changes from 3s to another color, that level is COMPLETE.\n* Track remaining MOVES/ENERGY by counting tiles with value 15.\n* Track LIVES by counting distinct 2×2 blocks of 8s.\n\n# GENERAL NOTES\n* The grid is a bird’s-eye view.\n* If the grid does not change after an action, you likely attempted an illegal move into 4s.\n* Favor routes marked by 3s; scan for 0/9 patches (generator) and confirm exit by nearby 5s; confirm the key by matching the bottom-left blueprint of 0s/9s.\n\n# EXAMPLE STRATEGY OBSERVATION\nThe 8×8 player (top rows 12s, bottom rows 9s) is flush against 4s on the left, so LEFT is blocked. I can see a 0/9 patch reachable via 3s to the right (likely the generator) and some 5s beyond it, so I should move RIGHT toward that corridor, cycling the key on the generator until the bottom-left key matches the one at the exit.\n\n# TURN:\nCall exactly one action.\n"

Keep an eye on walls to avoid illegal overlap."

    "content": "\n# CONTEXT:\nYou are an agent playing a dynamic game. Your objective is to\nWIN and avoid GAME_OVER while minimizing actions.\n\nOne action produces one Frame. One Frame is made of one or more sequential\nGrids. Each Grid is a matrix size INT<0,63> by INT<0,63> filled with\nINT<0,15> values. Each value represents a different color and usually implies a different object.\n\nYou are playing a game called LockSmith.\n\n# CONTROLS\n* RESET: start over\n* ACTION1: move up\n* ACTION2: move down\n* ACTION3: move left\n* ACTION4: move right\n* ACTION5/ACTION6: no-ops\n\n# GOAL\nFind/generate a key that MATCHES the key pattern shown at the EXIT, then navigate to the EXIT to finish the level.\nThere are 6 levels total. Complete all levels to WIN.\n\n# TILE MEANINGS (important ones)\n* 0 = white cell (used in key patterns)\n* 3 = walkable path / corridor marker (often outlines routes to key/exit)\n* 4 = WALL (solid). You cannot enter 4s.\n* 5 = EXIT indicator (presence of 5s marks/frames the exit area)\n* 8 = LIFE token (count lives as the number of 2×2 blocks of 8s)\n* 9 = blue cells (used in player lower body; also appear elsewhere in the map and in key logic)\n* 12 = orange cells (used in player upper body)\n* 15 = MOVE counter (number of 15s ≈ moves/energy left)\n\n# PLAYER (sprite + movement legality)\n* The player is an 8×8 sprite made ONLY of 12s (top two rows) over 9s (bottom six rows).\n  - Concretely: rows 0–1 (relative to the sprite) are all 12s; rows 2–7 are all 9s.\n  - Other scattered 9s on the board are NOT the player—only the exact 8×8 (2×8 of 12s stacked on 6×8 of 9s) is the player.\n* Movement rules:\n  - You may move only through non-4 cells (i.e., never overlap a 4 after a move).\n  - If any part of your 8×8 sprite would overlap a 4 in the target direction (including cases where 4s lie “under” 9s), that move is ILLEGAL.\n  - If your sprite is already touching 4s on a side, you cannot move further in that touching direction until you have clearance.\n  - Practically: navigate corridors “between the 4s”.\n\n# KEYS, EXIT, AND HOW TO FIND THEM\n* The EXIT contains (or is adjacent to) the target key pattern and is marked by nearby 5s (it need not be fully surrounded; any 5s strongly indicate the exit region).\n* The bottom-left of the entire grid shows the REQUIRED KEY BLUEPRINT you must match: a specific layout of 0s (white) and 9s (blue).\n* Key generation mechanism (explicit):\n  - The KEY GENERATOR is a field/patch consisting of 0s and 9s that is NOT surrounded by 5s (i.e., not the exit).\n  - When any part of your 8×8 player walks onto this patch, a NEW candidate key is generated and displayed in the bottom-left.\n  - Step OFF the patch and then back ON to generate yet another candidate key; repeat to cycle through possibilities.\n  - You must keep cycling until the bottom-left candidate key EXACTLY matches the exit’s key (the same distribution of 0s and 9s seen within/adjacent to the 5s).\n* A reliable way to locate both the EXIT and the KEY GENERATOR area:\n  - Look for clusters of 0s and 9s reachable via 3s; if they are NOT framed by 5s, that area is most likely the generator. If you see 5s nearby framing a matching 0/9 pattern, that marks the exit.\n* When the pattern shown in the bottom-left matches the arrangement of 0s and 9s you see framed by (or adjacent to) 5s at the exit, move toward the 5s to complete the level.\n\n# HUD / PROGRESSION\n* Visual score on the second-to-last grid row (row 62): it contains several 4-cell “slots”.\n  - Slots made of 3s represent UNFINISHED levels.\n  - When a slot changes from 3s to another color, that level is COMPLETE.\n* Track remaining MOVES/ENERGY by counting tiles with value 15.\n* Track LIVES by counting distinct 2×2 blocks of 8s.\n\n# GENERAL NOTES\n* The grid is a bird’s-eye view.\n* If the grid does not change after an action, you likely attempted an illegal move into 4s.\n* Favor routes marked by 3s; scan for 0/9 patches (generator) and confirm exit by nearby 5s; confirm the key by matching the bottom-left blueprint of 0s/9s.\n\n# EXAMPLE STRATEGY OBSERVATION\nThe 8×8 player (top rows 12s, bottom rows 9s) is flush against 4s on the left, so LEFT is blocked. I can see a 0/9 patch reachable via 3s to the right (likely the generator) and some 5s beyond it, so I should move RIGHT toward that corridor, cycling the key on the generator until the bottom-left key matches the one at the exit.\n\n# TURN:\nCall exactly one action.\n"

    "content": "\n# CONTEXT:\nYou are an agent playing a dynamic game. Your objective is to\nWIN and avoid GAME_OVER while minimizing actions.\n\nOne action produces one Frame. One Frame is made of one or more sequential\nGrids. Each Grid is a matrix size INT<0,63> by INT<0,63> filled with\nINT<0,15> values. Each value represents a different color and usually implies a different object.\n\nYou are playing a game called LockSmith.\n\n# CONTROLS\n* RESET: start over\n* ACTION1: move up\n* ACTION2: move down\n* ACTION3: move left\n* ACTION4: move right\n* ACTION5/ACTION6: no-ops\n\n# GOAL\nFind/generate a key that MATCHES the key pattern shown at the EXIT, then navigate to the EXIT to finish the level.\nThere are 6 levels total.

You cannot enter 4s.\n* 5 = EXIT indicator (presence of 5s marks/frames the exit area)\n* 8 = LIFE token (count lives as the number of 2×2 blocks of 8s)\n* 9 = blue cells (used in player lower body; also appear elsewhere in the map and in key logic)\n* 12 = orange cells (used in player upper body)\n* 15 = MOVE counter (number of 15s ≈ moves/energy left)\n\n# PLAYER (sprite + movement legality)\n* The player is an 8×8 sprite made ONLY of 12s (top two rows) over 9s (bottom six rows).\n  - Concretely: rows 0–1 (relative to the sprite) are all 12s; rows 2–7 are all 9s.\n  - Other scattered 9s on the board are NOT the player—only the exact 8×8 (2×8 of 12s stacked on 6×8 of 9s) is the player.\n* Movement rules:\n  - You may move only through non-4 cells (i.e., never overlap a 4 after a move).\n  - If any part of your 8×8 sprite would overlap a 4 in the target direction (including cases where 4s lie “under” 9s), that move is ILLEGAL.\n  - If your sprite is already touching 4s on a side, you cannot move further in that touching direction until you have clearance.\n  - Practically: navigate corridors “between the 4s”.\n\n# KEYS, EXIT, AND HOW TO FIND THEM\n* The EXIT contains (or is adjacent to) the target key pattern and is marked by nearby 5s (it need not be fully surrounded; any 5s strongly indicate the exit region).\n* The bottom-left of the entire grid shows the REQUIRED KEY BLUEPRINT you must match: a specific layout of 0s (white) and 9s (blue).\n* Key generation mechanism (explicit):\n  - The KEY GENERATOR is a field/patch consisting of 0s and 9s that is NOT surrounded by 5s (i.e., not the exit).\n  - When any part of your 8×8 player walks onto this patch, a NEW candidate key is generated and displayed in the bottom-left.\n  - Step OFF the patch and then back ON to generate yet another candidate key; repeat to cycle through possibilities.\n  - You must keep cycling until the bottom-left candidate key EXACTLY matches the exit’s key (the same distribution of 0s and 9s seen within/adjacent to the 5s).\n* A reliable way to locate both the EXIT and the KEY GENERATOR area:\n  - Look for clusters of 0s and 9s reachable via 3s; if they are NOT framed by 5s, that area is most likely the generator. If you see 5s nearby framing a matching 0/9 pattern, that marks the exit.\n* When the pattern shown in the bottom-left matches the arrangement of 0s and 9s you see framed by (or adjacent to) 5s at the exit, move toward the 5s to complete the level.\n\n# HUD / PROGRESSION\n* Visual score on the second-to-last grid row (row 62): it contains several 4-cell “slots”.\n  - Slots made of 3s represent UNFINISHED levels.\n  - When a slot changes from 3s to another color, that level is COMPLETE.\n* Track remaining MOVES/ENERGY by counting tiles with value 15.\n* Track LIVES by counting distinct 2×2 blocks of 8s.\n\n# GENERAL NOTES\n* The grid is a bird’s-eye view.\n* If the grid does not change after an action, you likely attempted an illegal move into 4s.\n* Favor routes marked by 3s; scan for 0/9 patches (generator) and confirm exit by nearby 5s; confirm the key by matching the bottom-left blueprint of 0s/9s.\n\n# EXAMPLE STRATEGY OBSERVATION\nThe 8×8 player (top rows 12s, bottom rows 9s) is flush against 4s on the left, so LEFT is blocked. I can see a 0/9 patch reachable via 3s to the right (likely the generator) and some 5s beyond it, so I should move RIGHT toward that corridor, cycling the key on the generator until the bottom-left key matches the one at the exit.\n\n# TURN:\nCall exactly one action.\n"

    "content": "\n# CONTEXT:\nYou are an agent playing a dynamic game. Your objective is to\nWIN and avoid GAME_OVER while minimizing actions.\n\nOne action produces one Frame. One Frame is made of one or more sequential\nGrids. Each Grid is a matrix size INT<0,63> by INT<0,63> filled with\nINT<0,15> values. Each value represents a different color and usually implies a different object.\n\nYou are playing a game called LockSmith.\n\n# CONTROLS\n* RESET: start over\n* ACTION1: move up\n* ACTION2: move down\n* ACTION3: move left\n* ACTION4: move right\n* ACTION5/ACTION6: no-ops\n\n# GOAL\nFind/generate a key that MATCHES the key pattern shown at the EXIT, then navigate to the EXIT to finish the level.\nThere are 6 levels total. Complete all levels to WIN.\n\n# TILE MEANINGS (important ones)\n* 0 = white cell (used in key patterns)\n* 3 = walkable path / corridor marker (often outlines routes to key/exit)\n* 4 = WALL (solid). You cannot enter 4s.\n* 5 = EXIT indicator (presence of 5s marks/frames the exit area)\n* 8 = LIFE token (count lives as the number of 2×2 blocks of 8s)\n* 9 = blue cells (used in player lower body; also appear elsewhere in the map and in key logic)\n* 12 = orange cells (used in player upper body)\n* 15 = MOVE counter (number of 15s ≈ moves/energy left)\n\n# PLAYER (sprite + movement legality)\n* The player is an 8×8 sprite made ONLY of 12s (top two rows) over 9s (bottom six rows).\n  - Concretely: rows 0–1 (relative to the sprite) are all 12s; rows 2–7 are all 9s.\n  - Other scattered 9s on the board are NOT the player—only the exact 8×8 (2×8 of 12s stacked on 6×8 of 9s) is the player.\n* Movement rules:\n  - You may move only through non-4 cells (i.e., never overlap a 4 after a move).\n  - If any part of your 8×8 sprite would overlap a 4 in the target direction (including cases where 4s lie “under” 9s), that move is ILLEGAL.\n  - If your sprite is already touching 4s on a side, you cannot move further in that touching direction until you have clearance.\n  - Practically: navigate corridors “between the 4s”.\n\n# KEYS, EXIT, AND HOW TO FIND THEM\n* The EXIT contains (or is adjacent to) the target key pattern and is marked by nearby 5s (it need not be fully surrounded; any 5s strongly indicate the exit region).\n* The bottom-left of the entire grid shows the REQUIRED KEY BLUEPRINT you must match: a specific layout of 0s (white) and 9s (blue).\n* Key generation mechanism (explicit):\n  - The KEY GENERATOR is a field/patch consisting of 0s and 9s that is NOT surrounded by 5s (i.e., not the exit).\n  - When any part of your 8×8 player walks onto this patch, a NEW candidate key is generated and displayed in the bottom-left.\n  - Step OFF the patch and then back ON to generate yet another candidate key; repeat to cycle through possibilities.\n  - You must keep cycling until the bottom-left candidate key EXACTLY matches the exit’s key (the same distribution of 0s and 9s seen within/adjacent to the 5s).\n* A reliable way to locate both the EXIT and the KEY GENERATOR area:\n  - Look for clusters of 0s and 9s reachable via 3s; if they are NOT framed by 5s, that area is most likely the generator. If you see 5s nearby framing a matching 0/9 pattern, that marks the exit.\n* When the pattern shown in the bottom-left matches the arrangement of 0s and 9s you see framed by (or adjacent to) 5s at the exit, move toward the 5s to complete the level.\n\n# HUD / PROGRESSION\n* Visual score on the second-to-last grid row (row 62): it contains several 4-cell “slots”.\n  - Slots made of 3s represent UNFINISHED levels.\n  - When a slot changes from 3s to another color, that level is COMPLETE.\n* Track remaining MOVES/ENERGY by counting tiles with value 15.\n* Track LIVES by counting distinct 2×2 blocks of 8s.\n\n# GENERAL NOTES\n* The grid is a bird’s-eye view.\n* If the grid does not change after an action, you likely attempted an illegal move into 4s.\n* Favor routes marked by 3s; scan for 0/9 patches (generator) and confirm exit by nearby 5s; confirm the key by matching the bottom-left blueprint of 0s/9s.\n\n# EXAMPLE STRATEGY OBSERVATION\nThe 8×8 player (top rows 12s, bottom rows 9s) is flush against 4s on the left, so LEFT is blocked. I can see a 0/9 patch reachable via 3s to the right (likely the generator) and some 5s beyond it, so I should move RIGHT toward that corridor, cycling the key on the generator until the bottom-left key matches the one at the exit.\n\n# TURN:\nCall exactly one action.\n"

There are 5s marking the EXIT region elsewhere, indicating the exit area and its surrounding key pattern. The 8×8 player sits near walkable paths but cannot cross walls (4s).\n\nStrategy: Move along the 3s corridor to reach the generator patch, then step onto/off it to cycle candidate keys. Continue cycling until the bottom-left key blueprint (0s/9s pattern) matches the exit’s key pattern, then navigate toward the nearby 5s to complete the level. Prioritize keeping the sprite away from any 4s and use the generator patches to generate a valid key."

    "content": "\n# CONTEXT:\nYou are an agent playing a dynamic game. Your objective is to\nWIN and avoid GAME_OVER while minimizing actions.\n\nOne action produces one Frame. One Frame is made of one or more sequential\nGrids. Each Grid is a matrix size INT<0,63> by INT<0,63> filled with\nINT<0,15> values. Each value represents a different color and usually implies a different object.\n\nYou are playing a game called LockSmith.\n\n# CONTROLS\n* RESET: start over\n* ACTION1: move up\n* ACTION2: move down\n* ACTION3: move left\n* ACTION4: move right\n* ACTION5/ACTION6: no-ops\n\n# GOAL\nFind/generate a key that MATCHES the key pattern shown at the EXIT, then navigate to the EXIT to finish the level.\nThere are 6 levels total. Complete all levels to WIN.\n\n# TILE MEANINGS (important ones)\n* 0 = white cell (used in key patterns)\n* 3 = walkable path / corridor marker (often outlines routes to key/exit)\n* 4 = WALL (solid). You cannot enter 4s.\n* 5 = EXIT indicator (presence of 5s marks/frames the exit area)\n* 8 = LIFE token (count lives as the number of 2×2 blocks of 8s)\n* 9 = blue cells (used in player lower body; also appear elsewhere in the map and in key logic)\n* 12 = orange cells (used in player upper body)\n* 15 = MOVE counter (number of 15s ≈ moves/energy left)\n\n# PLAYER (sprite + movement legality)\n* The player is an 8×8 sprite made ONLY of 12s (top two rows) over 9s (bottom six rows).\n  - Concretely: rows 0–1 (relative to the sprite) are all 12s; rows 2–7 are all 9s.\n  - Other scattered 9s on the board are NOT the player—only the exact 8×8 (2×8 of 12s stacked on 6×8 of 9s) is the player.\n* Movement rules:\n  - You may move only through non-4 cells (i.e., never overlap a 4 after a move).\n  - If any part of your 8×8 sprite would overlap a 4 in the target direction (including cases where 4s lie “under” 9s), that move is ILLEGAL.\n  - If your sprite is already touching 4s on a side, you cannot move further in that touching direction until you have clearance.\n  - Practically: navigate corridors “between the 4s”.\n\n# KEYS, EXIT, AND HOW TO FIND THEM\n* The EXIT contains (or is adjacent to) the target key pattern and is marked by nearby 5s (it need not be fully surrounded; any 5s strongly indicate the exit region).\n* The bottom-left of the entire grid shows the REQUIRED KEY BLUEPRINT you must match: a specific layout of 0s (white) and 9s (blue).\n* Key generation mechanism (explicit):\n  - The KEY GENERATOR is a field/patch consisting of 0s and 9s that is NOT surrounded by 5s (i.e., not the exit).\n  - When any part of your 8×8 player walks onto this patch, a NEW candidate key is generated and displayed in the bottom-left.\n  - Step OFF the patch and then back ON to generate yet another candidate key; repeat to cycle through possibilities.\n  - You must keep cycling until the bottom-left candidate key EXACTLY matches the exit’s key (the same distribution of 0s and 9s seen within/adjacent to the 5s).\n* A reliable way to locate both the EXIT and the KEY GENERATOR area:\n  - Look for clusters of 0s and 9s reachable via 3s; if they are NOT framed by 5s, that area is most likely the generator. If you see 5s nearby framing a matching 0/9 pattern, that marks the exit.\n* When the pattern shown in the bottom-left matches the arrangement of 0s and 9s you see framed by (or adjacent to) 5s at the exit, move toward the 5s to complete the level.\n\n# HUD / PROGRESSION\n* Visual score on the second-to-last grid row (row 62): it contains several 4-cell “slots”.\n  - Slots made of 3s represent UNFINISHED levels.\n  - When a slot changes from 3s to another color, that level is COMPLETE.\n* Track remaining MOVES/ENERGY by counting tiles with value 15.\n* Track LIVES by counting distinct 2×2 blocks of 8s.\n\n# GENERAL NOTES\n* The grid is a bird’s-eye view.\n* If the grid does not change after an action, you likely attempted an illegal move into 4s.\n* Favor routes marked by 3s; scan for 0/9 patches (generator) and confirm exit by nearby 5s; confirm the key by matching the bottom-left blueprint of 0s/9s.\n\n# EXAMPLE STRATEGY OBSERVATION\nThe 8×8 player (top rows 12s, bottom rows 9s) is flush against 4s on the left, so LEFT is blocked. I can see a 0/9 patch reachable via 3s to the right (likely the generator) and some 5s beyond it, so I should move RIGHT toward that corridor, cycling the key on the generator until the bottom-left key matches the one at the exit.\n\n# TURN:\nCall exactly one action.\n"

The area around the bottom-left shows a dense 0/9 pattern that matches the generator behavior, but we need to step onto the generator patch to cycle keys. The immediate next move should push the player along the accessible corridor while avoiding walls (4s).\n\nAction: ACTION4 (move right)\n\nReasoning: It advances along the visible 3-corridor toward the generator area to cycle keys while staying clear of walls. If blocked, we’ll reassess and try ACTION1/ACTION2 to adjust vertically within safe bounds."

    "content": "\n# CONTEXT:\nYou are an agent playing a dynamic game. Your objective is to\nWIN and avoid GAME_OVER while minimizing actions.\n\nOne action produces one Frame. One Frame is made of one or more sequential\nGrids. Each Grid is a matrix size INT<0,63> by INT<0,63> filled with\nINT<0,15> values. Each value represents a different color and usually implies a different object.\n\nYou are playing a game called LockSmith.\n\n# CONTROLS\n* RESET: start over\n* ACTION1: move up\n* ACTION2: move down\n* ACTION3: move left\n* ACTION4: move right\n* ACTION5/ACTION6: no-ops\n\n# GOAL\nFind/generate a key that MATCHES the key pattern shown at the EXIT, then navigate to the EXIT to finish the level.\nThere are 6 levels total. Complete all levels to WIN.\n\n# TILE MEANINGS (important ones)\n* 0 = white cell (used in key patterns)\n* 3 = walkable path / corridor marker (often outlines routes to key/exit)\n* 4 = WALL (solid). You cannot enter 4s.\n* 5 = EXIT indicator (presence of 5s marks/frames the exit area)\n* 8 = LIFE token (count lives as the number of 2×2 blocks of 8s)\n* 9 = blue cells (used in player lower body; also appear elsewhere in the map and in key logic)\n* 12 = orange cells (used in player upper body)\n* 15 = MOVE counter (number of 15s ≈ moves/energy left)\n\n# PLAYER (sprite + movement legality)\n* The player is an 8×8 sprite made ONLY of 12s (top two rows) over 9s (bottom six rows).\n  - Concretely: rows 0–1 (relative to the sprite) are all 12s; rows 2–7 are all 9s.\n  - Other scattered 9s on the board are NOT the player—only the exact 8×8 (2×8 of 12s stacked on 6×8 of 9s) is the player.\n* Movement rules:\n  - You may move only through non-4 cells (i.e., never overlap a 4 after a move).\n  - If any part of your 8×8 sprite would overlap a 4 in the target direction (including cases where 4s lie “under” 9s), that move is ILLEGAL.\n  - If your sprite is already touching 4s on a side, you cannot move further in that touching direction until you have clearance.\n  - Practically: navigate corridors “between the 4s”.\n\n# KEYS, EXIT, AND HOW TO FIND THEM\n* The EXIT contains (or is adjacent to) the target key pattern and is marked by nearby 5s (it need not be fully surrounded; any 5s strongly indicate the exit region).\n* The bottom-left of the entire grid shows the REQUIRED KEY BLUEPRINT you must match: a specific layout of 0s (white) and 9s (blue).\n* Key generation mechanism (explicit):\n  - The KEY GENERATOR is a field/patch consisting of 0s and 9s that is NOT surrounded by 5s (i.e., not the exit).\n  - When any part of your 8×8 player walks onto this patch, a NEW candidate key is generated and displayed in the bottom-left.\n  - Step OFF the patch and then back ON to generate yet another candidate key; repeat to cycle through possibilities.\n  - You must keep cycling until the bottom-left candidate key EXACTLY matches the exit’s key (the same distribution of 0s and 9s seen within/adjacent to the 5s).\n* A reliable way to locate both the EXIT and the KEY GENERATOR area:\n  - Look for clusters of 0s and 9s reachable via 3s; if they are NOT framed by 5s, that area is most likely the generator. If you see 5s nearby framing a matching 0/9 pattern, that marks the exit.\n* When the pattern shown in the bottom-left matches the arrangement of 0s and 9s you see framed by (or adjacent to) 5s at the exit, move toward the 5s to complete the level.\n\n# HUD / PROGRESSION\n* Visual score on the second-to-last grid row (row 62): it contains several 4-cell “slots”.\n  - Slots made of 3s represent UNFINISHED levels.\n  - When a slot changes from 3s to another color, that level is COMPLETE.\n* Track remaining MOVES/ENERGY by counting tiles with value 15.\n* Track LIVES by counting distinct 2×2 blocks of 8s.\n\n# GENERAL NOTES\n* The grid is a bird’s-eye view.\n* If the grid does not change after an action, you likely attempted an illegal move into 4s.\n* Favor routes marked by 3s; scan for 0/9 patches (generator) and confirm exit by nearby 5s; confirm the key by matching the bottom-left blueprint of 0s/9s.\n\n# EXAMPLE STRATEGY OBSERVATION\nThe 8×8 player (top rows 12s, bottom rows 9s) is flush against 4s on the left, so LEFT is blocked. I can see a 0/9 patch reachable via 3s to the right (likely the generator) and some 5s beyond it, so I should move RIGHT toward that corridor, cycling the key on the generator until the bottom-left key matches the one at the exit.\n\n# TURN:\nCall exactly one action.\n"

    "content": "\n# CONTEXT:\nYou are an agent playing a dynamic game. Your objective is to\nWIN and avoid GAME_OVER while minimizing actions.\n\nOne action produces one Frame. One Frame is made of one or more sequential\nGrids. Each Grid is a matrix size INT<0,63> by INT<0,63> filled with\nINT<0,15> values. Each value represents a different color and usually implies a different object.\n\nYou are playing a game called LockSmith.\n\n# CONTROLS\n* RESET: start over\n* ACTION1: move up\n* ACTION2: move down\n* ACTION3: move left\n* ACTION4: move right\n* ACTION5/ACTION6: no-ops\n\n# GOAL\nFind/generate a key that MATCHES the key pattern shown at the EXIT, then navigate to the EXIT to finish the level.\nThere are 6 levels total. Complete all levels to WIN.\n\n# TILE MEANINGS (important ones)\n* 0 = white cell (used in key patterns)\n* 3 = walkable path / corridor marker (often outlines routes to key/exit)\n* 4 = WALL (solid). You cannot enter 4s.\n* 5 = EXIT indicator (presence of 5s marks/frames the exit area)\n* 8 = LIFE token (count lives as the number of 2×2 blocks of 8s)\n* 9 = blue cells (used in player lower body; also appear elsewhere in the map and in key logic)\n* 12 = orange cells (used in player upper body)\n* 15 = MOVE counter (number of 15s ≈ moves/energy left)\n\n# PLAYER (sprite + movement legality)\n* The player is an 8×8 sprite made ONLY of 12s (top two rows) over 9s (bottom six rows).\n  - Concretely: rows 0–1 (relative to the sprite) are all 12s; rows 2–7 are all 9s.\n  - Other scattered 9s on the board are NOT the player—only the exact 8×8 (2×8 of 12s stacked on 6×8 of 9s) is the player.\n* Movement rules:\n  - You may move only through non-4 cells (i.e., never overlap a 4 after a move).\n  - If any part of your 8×8 sprite would overlap a 4 in the target direction (including cases where 4s lie “under” 9s), that move is ILLEGAL.\n  - If your sprite is already touching 4s on a side, you cannot move further in that touching direction until you have clearance.\n  - Practically: navigate corridors “between the 4s”.\n\n# KEYS, EXIT, AND HOW TO FIND THEM\n* The EXIT contains (or is adjacent to) the target key pattern and is marked by nearby 5s (it need not be fully surrounded; any 5s strongly indicate the exit region).\n* The bottom-left of the entire grid shows the REQUIRED KEY BLUEPRINT you must match: a specific layout of 0s (white) and 9s (blue).\n* Key generation mechanism (explicit):\n  - The KEY GENERATOR is a field/patch consisting of 0s and 9s that is NOT surrounded by 5s (i.e., not the exit).\n  - When any part of your 8×8 player walks onto this patch, a NEW candidate key is generated and displayed in the bottom-left.\n  - Step OFF the patch and then back ON to generate yet another candidate key; repeat to cycle through possibilities.\n  - You must keep cycling until the bottom-left candidate key EXACTLY matches the exit’s key (the same distribution of 0s and 9s seen within/adjacent to the 5s).\n* A reliable way to locate both the EXIT and the KEY GENERATOR area:\n  - Look for clusters of 0s and 9s reachable via 3s; if they are NOT framed by 5s, that area is most likely the generator. If you see 5s nearby framing a matching 0/9 pattern, that marks the exit.\n* When the pattern shown in the bottom-left matches the arrangement of 0s and 9s you see framed by (or adjacent to) 5s at the exit, move toward the 5s to complete the level.\n\n# HUD / PROGRESSION\n* Visual score on the second-to-last grid row (row 62): it contains several 4-cell “slots”.\n  - Slots made of 3s represent UNFINISHED levels.\n  - When a slot changes from 3s to another color, that level is COMPLETE.\n* Track remaining MOVES/ENERGY by counting tiles with value 15.\n* Track LIVES by counting distinct 2×2 blocks of 8s.\n\n# GENERAL NOTES\n* The grid is a bird’s-eye view.\n* If the grid does not change after an action, you likely attempted an illegal move into 4s.\n* Favor routes marked by 3s; scan for 0/9 patches (generator) and confirm exit by nearby 5s; confirm the key by matching the bottom-left blueprint of 0s/9s.\n\n# EXAMPLE STRATEGY OBSERVATION\nThe 8×8 player (top rows 12s, bottom rows 9s) is flush against 4s on the left, so LEFT is blocked. I can see a 0/9 patch reachable via 3s to the right (likely the generator) and some 5s beyond it, so I should move RIGHT toward that corridor, cycling the key on the generator until the bottom-left key matches the one at the exit.\n\n# TURN:\nCall exactly one action.\n"

A bottom-left region contains a 0/9 patch (potential key generator) reachable via the 3s corridors, while the exit area is indicated by nearby 5s in the upper/lateral area of the frame.\n- The generator should be approached along the 3s path, then stepping onto the 0/9 patch will generate a new candidate key in the bottom-left. Off and back on the patch to cycle through keys until one matches the exit’s key pattern (the 0/9 layout framed by 5s).\n- Plan: steer along safe 3s corridors toward the bottom-left generator, cycle keys by stepping onto/off the patch, and once a candidate matches the exit pattern, head to the 5s-marked exit to finish. Avoid 4s at all times and watch the move budget (15s) and lives (8s) as you reposition."

    "content": "\n# CONTEXT:\nYou are an agent playing a dynamic game. Your objective is to\nWIN and avoid GAME_OVER while minimizing actions.\n\nOne action produces one Frame. One Frame is made of one or more sequential\nGrids. Each Grid is a matrix size INT<0,63> by INT<0,63> filled with\nINT<0,15> values. Each value represents a different color and usually implies a different object.\n\nYou are playing a game called LockSmith.\n\n# CONTROLS\n* RESET: start over\n* ACTION1: move up\n* ACTION2: move down\n* ACTION3: move left\n* ACTION4: move right\n* ACTION5/ACTION6: no-ops\n\n# GOAL\nFind/generate a key that MATCHES the key pattern shown at the EXIT, then navigate to the EXIT to finish the level.\nThere are 6 levels total. Complete all levels to WIN.\n\n# TILE MEANINGS (important ones)\n* 0 = white cell (used in key patterns)\n* 3 = walkable path / corridor marker (often outlines routes to key/exit)\n* 4 = WALL (solid). You cannot enter 4s.\n* 5 = EXIT indicator (presence of 5s marks/frames the exit area)\n* 8 = LIFE token (count lives as the number of 2×2 blocks of 8s)\n* 9 = blue cells (used in player lower body; also appear elsewhere in the map and in key logic)\n* 12 = orange cells (used in player upper body)\n* 15 = MOVE counter (number of 15s ≈ moves/energy left)\n\n# PLAYER (sprite + movement legality)\n* The player is an 8×8 sprite made ONLY of 12s (top two rows) over 9s (bottom six rows).\n  - Concretely: rows 0–1 (relative to the sprite) are all 12s; rows 2–7 are all 9s.\n  - Other scattered 9s on the board are NOT the player—only the exact 8×8 (2×8 of 12s stacked on 6×8 of 9s) is the player.\n* Movement rules:\n  - You may move only through non-4 cells (i.e., never overlap a 4 after a move).\n  - If any part of your 8×8 sprite would overlap a 4 in the target direction (including cases where 4s lie “under” 9s), that move is ILLEGAL.\n  - If your sprite is already touching 4s on a side, you cannot move further in that touching direction until you have clearance.\n  - Practically: navigate corridors “between the 4s”.\n\n# KEYS, EXIT, AND HOW TO FIND THEM\n* The EXIT contains (or is adjacent to) the target key pattern and is marked by nearby 5s (it need not be fully surrounded; any 5s strongly indicate the exit region).\n* The bottom-left of the entire grid shows the REQUIRED KEY BLUEPRINT you must match: a specific layout of 0s (white) and 9s (blue).\n* Key generation mechanism (explicit):\n  - The KEY GENERATOR is a field/patch consisting of 0s and 9s that is NOT surrounded by 5s (i.e., not the exit).\n  - When any part of your 8×8 player walks onto this patch, a NEW candidate key is generated and displayed in the bottom-left.\n  - Step OFF the patch and then back ON to generate yet another candidate key; repeat to cycle through possibilities.\n  - You must keep cycling until the bottom-left candidate key EXACTLY matches the exit’s key (the same distribution of 0s and 9s seen within/adjacent to the 5s).\n* A reliable way to locate both the EXIT and the KEY GENERATOR area:\n  - Look for clusters of 0s and 9s reachable via 3s; if they are NOT framed by 5s, that area is most likely the generator. If you see 5s nearby framing a matching 0/9 pattern, that marks the exit.\n* When the pattern shown in the bottom-left matches the arrangement of 0s and 9s you see framed by (or adjacent to) 5s at the exit, move toward the 5s to complete the level.\n\n# HUD / PROGRESSION\n* Visual score on the second-to-last grid row (row 62): it contains several 4-cell “slots”.\n  - Slots made of 3s represent UNFINISHED levels.\n  - When a slot changes from 3s to another color, that level is COMPLETE.\n* Track remaining MOVES/ENERGY by counting tiles with value 15.\n* Track LIVES by counting distinct 2×2 blocks of 8s.\n\n# GENERAL NOTES\n* The grid is a bird’s-eye view.\n* If the grid does not change after an action, you likely attempted an illegal move into 4s.\n* Favor routes marked by 3s; scan for 0/9 patches (generator) and confirm exit by nearby 5s; confirm the key by matching the bottom-left blueprint of 0s/9s.\n\n# EXAMPLE STRATEGY OBSERVATION\nThe 8×8 player (top rows 12s, bottom rows 9s) is flush against 4s on the left, so LEFT is blocked. I can see a 0/9 patch reachable via 3s to the right (likely the generator) and some 5s beyond it, so I should move RIGHT toward that corridor, cycling the key on the generator until the bottom-left key matches the one at the exit.\n\n# TURN:\nCall exactly one action.\n"

If you see 5s nearby framing a matching 0/9 pattern, that marks the exit.\n* When the pattern shown in the bottom-left matches the arrangement of 0s and 9s you see framed by (or adjacent to) 5s at the exit, move toward the 5s to complete the level.\n\n# HUD / PROGRESSION\n* Visual score on the second-to-last grid row (row 62): it contains several 4-cell “slots”.\n  - Slots made of 3s represent UNFINISHED levels.\n  - When a slot changes from 3s to another color, that level is COMPLETE.\n* Track remaining MOVES/ENERGY by counting tiles with value 15.\n* Track LIVES by counting distinct 2×2 blocks of 8s.\n\n# GENERAL NOTES\n* The grid is a bird’s-eye view.\n* If the grid does not change after an action, you likely attempted an illegal move into 4s.\n* Favor routes marked by 3s; scan for 0/9 patches (generator) and confirm exit by nearby 5s; confirm the key by matching the bottom-left blueprint of 0s/9s.\n\n# EXAMPLE STRATEGY OBSERVATION\nThe 8×8 player (top rows 12s, bottom rows 9s) is flush against 4s on the left, so LEFT is blocked. I can see a 0/9 patch reachable via 3s to the right (likely the generator) and some 5s beyond it, so I should move RIGHT toward that corridor, cycling the key on the generator until the bottom-left key matches the one at the exit.\n\n# TURN:\nCall exactly one action.\n"

    "content": "\n# CONTEXT:\nYou are an agent playing a dynamic game. Your objective is to\nWIN and avoid GAME_OVER while minimizing actions.\n\nOne action produces one Frame. One Frame is made of one or more sequential\nGrids. Each Grid is a matrix size INT<0,63> by INT<0,63> filled with\nINT<0,15> values. Each value represents a different color and usually implies a different object.\n\nYou are playing a game called LockSmith.\n\n# CONTROLS\n* RESET: start over\n* ACTION1: move up\n* ACTION2: move down\n* ACTION3: move left\n* ACTION4: move right\n* ACTION5/ACTION6: no-ops\n\n# GOAL\nFind/generate a key that MATCHES the key pattern shown at the EXIT, then navigate to the EXIT to finish the level.\nThere are 6 levels total. Complete all levels to WIN.\n\n# TILE MEANINGS (important ones)\n* 0 = white cell (used in key patterns)\n* 3 = walkable path / corridor marker (often outlines routes to key/exit)\n* 4 = WALL (solid). You cannot enter 4s.\n* 5 = EXIT indicator (presence of 5s marks/frames the exit area)\n* 8 = LIFE token (count lives as the number of 2×2 blocks of 8s)\n* 9 = blue cells (used in player lower body; also appear elsewhere in the map and in key logic)\n* 12 = orange cells (used in player upper body)\n* 15 = MOVE counter (number of 15s ≈ moves/energy left)\n\n# PLAYER (sprite + movement legality)\n* The player is an 8×8 sprite made ONLY of 12s (top two rows) over 9s (bottom six rows).\n  - Concretely: rows 0–1 (relative to the sprite) are all 12s; rows 2–7 are all 9s.\n  - Other scattered 9s on the board are NOT the player—only the exact 8×8 (2×8 of 12s stacked on 6×8 of 9s) is the player.\n* Movement rules:\n  - You may move only through non-4 cells (i.e., never overlap a 4 after a move).\n  - If any part of your 8×8 sprite would overlap a 4 in the target direction (including cases where 4s lie “under” 9s), that move is ILLEGAL.\n  - If your sprite is already touching 4s on a side, you cannot move further in that touching direction until you have clearance.\n  - Practically: navigate corridors “between the 4s”.\n\n# KEYS, EXIT, AND HOW TO FIND THEM\n* The EXIT contains (or is adjacent to) the target key pattern and is marked by nearby 5s (it need not be fully surrounded; any 5s strongly indicate the exit region).\n* The bottom-left of the entire grid shows the REQUIRED KEY BLUEPRINT you must match: a specific layout of 0s (white) and 9s (blue).\n* Key generation mechanism (explicit):\n  - The KEY GENERATOR is a field/patch consisting of 0s and 9s that is NOT surrounded by 5s (i.e., not the exit).\n  - When any part of your 8×8 player walks onto this patch, a NEW candidate key is generated and displayed in the bottom-left.\n  - Step OFF the patch and then back ON to generate yet another candidate key; repeat to cycle through possibilities.\n  - You must keep cycling until the bottom-left candidate key EXACTLY matches the exit’s key (the same distribution of 0s and 9s seen within/adjacent to the 5s).\n* A reliable way to locate both the EXIT and the KEY GENERATOR area:\n  - Look for clusters of 0s and 9s reachable via 3s; if they are NOT framed by 5s, that area is most likely the generator. If you see 5s nearby framing a matching 0/9 pattern, that marks the exit.\n* When the pattern shown in the bottom-left matches the arrangement of 0s and 9s you see framed by (or adjacent to) 5s at the exit, move toward the 5s to complete the level.\n\n# HUD / PROGRESSION\n* Visual score on the second-to-last grid row (row 62): it contains several 4-cell “slots”.\n  - Slots made of 3s represent UNFINISHED levels.\n  - When a slot changes from 3s to another color, that level is COMPLETE.\n* Track remaining MOVES/ENERGY by counting tiles with value 15.\n* Track LIVES by counting distinct 2×2 blocks of 8s.\n\n# GENERAL NOTES\n* The grid is a bird’s-eye view.\n* If the grid does not change after an action, you likely attempted an illegal move into 4s.\n* Favor routes marked by 3s; scan for 0/9 patches (generator) and confirm exit by nearby 5s; confirm the key by matching the bottom-left blueprint of 0s/9s.\n\n# EXAMPLE STRATEGY OBSERVATION\nThe 8×8 player (top rows 12s, bottom rows 9s) is flush against 4s on the left, so LEFT is blocked. I can see a 0/9 patch reachable via 3s to the right (likely the generator) and some 5s beyond it, so I should move RIGHT toward that corridor, cycling the key on the generator until the bottom-left key matches the one at the exit.\n\n# TURN:\nCall exactly one action.\n"

    "content": "\n# CONTEXT:\nYou are an agent playing a dynamic game. Your objective is to\nWIN and avoid GAME_OVER while minimizing actions.\n\nOne action produces one Frame. One Frame is made of one or more sequential\nGrids. Each Grid is a matrix size INT<0,63> by INT<0,63> filled with\nINT<0,15> values. Each value represents a different color and usually implies a different object.\n\nYou are playing a game called LockSmith.\n\n# CONTROLS\n* RESET: start over\n* ACTION1: move up\n* ACTION2: move down\n* ACTION3: move left\n* ACTION4: move right\n* ACTION5/ACTION6: no-ops\n\n# GOAL\nFind/generate a key that MATCHES the key pattern shown at the EXIT, then navigate to the EXIT to finish the level.\nThere are 6 levels total. Complete all levels to WIN.\n\n# TILE MEANINGS (important ones)\n* 0 = white cell (used in key patterns)\n* 3 = walkable path / corridor marker (often outlines routes to key/exit)\n* 4 = WALL (solid). You cannot enter 4s.\n* 5 = EXIT indicator (presence of 5s marks/frames the exit area)\n* 8 = LIFE token (count lives as the number of 2×2 blocks of 8s)\n* 9 = blue cells (used in player lower body; also appear elsewhere in the map and in key logic)\n* 12 = orange cells (used in player upper body)\n* 15 = MOVE counter (number of 15s ≈ moves/energy left)\n\n# PLAYER (sprite + movement legality)\n* The player is an 8×8 sprite made ONLY of 12s (top two rows) over 9s (bottom six rows).\n  - Concretely: rows 0–1 (relative to the sprite) are all 12s; rows 2–7 are all 9s.\n  - Other scattered 9s on the board are NOT the player—only the exact 8×8 (2×8 of 12s stacked on 6×8 of 9s) is the player.\n* Movement rules:\n  - You may move only through non-4 cells (i.e., never overlap a 4 after a move).\n  - If any part of your 8×8 sprite would overlap a 4 in the target direction (including cases where 4s lie “under” 9s), that move is ILLEGAL.\n  - If your sprite is already touching 4s on a side, you cannot move further in that touching direction until you have clearance.\n  - Practically: navigate corridors “between the 4s”.\n\n# KEYS, EXIT, AND HOW TO FIND THEM\n* The EXIT contains (or is adjacent to) the target key pattern and is marked by nearby 5s (it need not be fully surrounded; any 5s strongly indicate the exit region).\n* The bottom-left of the entire grid shows the REQUIRED KEY BLUEPRINT you must match: a specific layout of 0s (white) and 9s (blue).\n* Key generation mechanism (explicit):\n  - The KEY GENERATOR is a field/patch consisting of 0s and 9s that is NOT surrounded by 5s (i.e., not the exit).\n  - When any part of your 8×8 player walks onto this patch, a NEW candidate key is generated and displayed in the bottom-left.\n  - Step OFF the patch and then back ON to generate yet another candidate key; repeat to cycle through possibilities.\n  - You must keep cycling until the bottom-left candidate key EXACTLY matches the exit’s key (the same distribution of 0s and 9s seen within/adjacent to the 5s).\n* A reliable way to locate both the EXIT and the KEY GENERATOR area:\n  - Look for clusters of 0s and 9s reachable via 3s; if they are NOT framed by 5s, that area is most likely the generator. If you see 5s nearby framing a matching 0/9 pattern, that marks the exit.\n* When the pattern shown in the bottom-left matches the arrangement of 0s and 9s you see framed by (or adjacent to) 5s at the exit, move toward the 5s to complete the level.\n\n# HUD / PROGRESSION\n* Visual score on the second-to-last grid row (row 62): it contains several 4-cell “slots”.\n  - Slots made of 3s represent UNFINISHED levels.\n  - When a slot changes from 3s to another color, that level is COMPLETE.\n* Track remaining MOVES/ENERGY by counting tiles with value 15.\n* Track LIVES by counting distinct 2×2 blocks of 8s.\n\n# GENERAL NOTES\n* The grid is a bird’s-eye view.\n* If the grid does not change after an action, you likely attempted an illegal move into 4s.\n* Favor routes marked by 3s; scan for 0/9 patches (generator) and confirm exit by nearby 5s; confirm the key by matching the bottom-left blueprint of 0s/9s.\n\n# EXAMPLE STRATEGY OBSERVATION\nThe 8×8 player (top rows 12s, bottom rows 9s) is flush against 4s on the left, so LEFT is blocked. I can see a 0/9 patch reachable via 3s to the right (likely the generator) and some 5s beyond it, so I should move RIGHT toward that corridor, cycling the key on the generator until the bottom-left key matches the one at the exit.\n\n# TURN:\nCall exactly one action.\n"

You’ll need to step onto it, then step off and back on to cycle keys.\n- The EXIT area should be near 5s; there are 5s visible in the upper/middle sections, indicating where a matching key would allow finish once generated.\n- Plan: navigate along the 3s corridors toward the bottom-left generator, cycle keys by stepping on/off the patch, and continue until a key matches the bottom-left blueprint. Then move toward the region framed by 5s to finish. Keep movement within bounds to avoid any overlap with 4s."

    "content": "\n# CONTEXT:\nYou are an agent playing a dynamic game. Your objective is to\nWIN and avoid GAME_OVER while minimizing actions.\n\nOne action produces one Frame. One Frame is made of one or more sequential\nGrids. Each Grid is a matrix size INT<0,63> by INT<0,63> filled with\nINT<0,15> values. Each value represents a different color and usually implies a different object.\n\nYou are playing a game called LockSmith.\n\n# CONTROLS\n* RESET: start over\n* ACTION1: move up\n* ACTION2: move down\n* ACTION3: move left\n* ACTION4: move right\n* ACTION5/ACTION6: no-ops\n\n# GOAL\nFind/generate a key that MATCHES the key pattern shown at the EXIT, then navigate to the EXIT to finish the level.\nThere are 6 levels total. Complete all levels to WIN.\n\n# TILE MEANINGS (important ones)\n* 0 = white cell (used in key patterns)\n* 3 = walkable path / corridor marker (often outlines routes to key/exit)\n* 4 = WALL (solid). You cannot enter 4s.\n* 5 = EXIT indicator (presence of 5s marks/frames the exit area)\n* 8 = LIFE token (count lives as the number of 2×2 blocks of 8s)\n* 9 = blue cells (used in player lower body; also appear elsewhere in the map and in key logic)\n* 12 = orange cells (used in player upper body)\n* 15 = MOVE counter (number of 15s ≈ moves/energy left)\n\n# PLAYER (sprite + movement legality)\n* The player is an 8×8 sprite made ONLY of 12s (top two rows) over 9s (bottom six rows).\n  - Concretely: rows 0–1 (relative to the sprite) are all 12s; rows 2–7 are all 9s.\n  - Other scattered 9s on the board are NOT the player—only the exact 8×8 (2×8 of 12s stacked on 6×8 of 9s) is the player.\n* Movement rules:\n  - You may move only through non-4 cells (i.e., never overlap a 4 after a move).\n  - If any part of your 8×8 sprite would overlap a 4 in the target direction (including cases where 4s lie “under” 9s), that move is ILLEGAL.\n  - If your sprite is already touching 4s on a side, you cannot move further in that touching direction until you have clearance.\n  - Practically: navigate corridors “between the 4s”.\n\n# KEYS, EXIT, AND HOW TO FIND THEM\n* The EXIT contains (or is adjacent to) the target key pattern and is marked by nearby 5s (it need not be fully surrounded; any 5s strongly indicate the exit region).\n* The bottom-left of the entire grid shows the REQUIRED KEY BLUEPRINT you must match: a specific layout of 0s (white) and 9s (blue).\n* Key generation mechanism (explicit):\n  - The KEY GENERATOR is a field/patch consisting of 0s and 9s that is NOT surrounded by 5s (i.e., not the exit).\n  - When any part of your 8×8 player walks onto this patch, a NEW candidate key is generated and displayed in the bottom-left.\n  - Step OFF the patch and then back ON to generate yet another candidate key; repeat to cycle through possibilities.\n  - You must keep cycling until the bottom-left candidate key EXACTLY matches the exit’s key (the same distribution of 0s and 9s seen within/adjacent to the 5s).\n* A reliable way to locate both the EXIT and the KEY GENERATOR area:\n  - Look for clusters of 0s and 9s reachable via 3s; if they are NOT framed by 5s, that area is most likely the generator. If you see 5s nearby framing a matching 0/9 pattern, that marks the exit.\n* When the pattern shown in the bottom-left matches the arrangement of 0s and 9s you see framed by (or adjacent to) 5s at the exit, move toward the 5s to complete the level.\n\n# HUD / PROGRESSION\n* Visual score on the second-to-last grid row (row 62): it contains several 4-cell “slots”.\n  - Slots made of 3s represent UNFINISHED levels.\n  - When a slot changes from 3s to another color, that level is COMPLETE.\n* Track remaining MOVES/ENERGY by counting tiles with value 15.\n* Track LIVES by counting distinct 2×2 blocks of 8s.\n\n# GENERAL NOTES\n* The grid is a bird’s-eye view.\n* If the grid does not change after an action, you likely attempted an illegal move into 4s.\n* Favor routes marked by 3s; scan for 0/9 patches (generator) and confirm exit by nearby 5s; confirm the key by matching the bottom-left blueprint of 0s/9s.\n\n# EXAMPLE STRATEGY OBSERVATION\nThe 8×8 player (top rows 12s, bottom rows 9s) is flush against 4s on the left, so LEFT is blocked. I can see a 0/9 patch reachable via 3s to the right (likely the generator) and some 5s beyond it, so I should move RIGHT toward that corridor, cycling the key on the generator until the bottom-left key matches the one at the exit.\n\n# TURN:\nCall exactly one action.\n"

There’s a cluster of 0s and 9s in the lower-left quadrant that likely represents the KEY GENERATOR patch (not surrounded by 5s).\n- The EXIT region is suggested by nearby 5s—there’s a noticeable block of 5s toward the central-to-lower area, which should mark where you’ll need to finish once a key matches.\n- To progress safely, aim to move along the available 3s corridors toward the bottom-left generator patch. Step onto the 0/9 patch to generate a candidate key, then step off and back onto the patch to cycle through options. Continue cycling until the bottom-left blueprint (the required key pattern of 0s and 9s) matches the candidate key.\n- Once the generated key matches the exit’s pattern, head toward the 5s near the exit and complete the level. Throughout, avoid overlapping any 4s by staying within the 3-marked corridors."

    "content": "\n# CONTEXT:\nYou are an agent playing a dynamic game. Your objective is to\nWIN and avoid GAME_OVER while minimizing actions.\n\nOne action produces one Frame. One Frame is made of one or more sequential\nGrids. Each Grid is a matrix size INT<0,63> by INT<0,63> filled with\nINT<0,15> values. Each value represents a different color and usually implies a different object.\n\nYou are playing a game called LockSmith.\n\n# CONTROLS\n* RESET: start over\n* ACTION1: move up\n* ACTION2: move down\n* ACTION3: move left\n* ACTION4: move right\n* ACTION5/ACTION6: no-ops\n\n# GOAL\nFind/generate a key that MATCHES the key pattern shown at the EXIT, then navigate to the EXIT to finish the level.\nThere are 6 levels total. Complete all levels to WIN.\n\n# TILE MEANINGS (important ones)\n* 0 = white cell (used in key patterns)\n* 3 = walkable path / corridor marker (often outlines routes to key/exit)\n* 4 = WALL (solid). You cannot enter 4s.\n* 5 = EXIT indicator (presence of 5s marks/frames the exit area)\n* 8 = LIFE token (count lives as the number of 2×2 blocks of 8s)\n* 9 = blue cells (used in player lower body; also appear elsewhere in the map and in key logic)\n* 12 = orange cells (used in player upper body)\n* 15 = MOVE counter (number of 15s ≈ moves/energy left)\n\n# PLAYER (sprite + movement legality)\n* The player is an 8×8 sprite made ONLY of 12s (top two rows) over 9s (bottom six rows).\n  - Concretely: rows 0–1 (relative to the sprite) are all 12s; rows 2–7 are all 9s.\n  - Other scattered 9s on the board are NOT the player—only the exact 8×8 (2×8 of 12s stacked on 6×8 of 9s) is the player.\n* Movement rules:\n  - You may move only through non-4 cells (i.e., never overlap a 4 after a move).\n  - If any part of your 8×8 sprite would overlap a 4 in the target direction (including cases where 4s lie “under” 9s), that move is ILLEGAL.\n  - If your sprite is already touching 4s on a side, you cannot move further in that touching direction until you have clearance.\n  - Practically: navigate corridors “between the 4s”.\n\n# KEYS, EXIT, AND HOW TO FIND THEM\n* The EXIT contains (or is adjacent to) the target key pattern and is marked by nearby 5s (it need not be fully surrounded; any 5s strongly indicate the exit region).\n* The bottom-left of the entire grid shows the REQUIRED KEY BLUEPRINT you must match: a specific layout of 0s (white) and 9s (blue).\n* Key generation mechanism (explicit):\n  - The KEY GENERATOR is a field/patch consisting of 0s and 9s that is NOT surrounded by 5s (i.e., not the exit).\n  - When any part of your 8×8 player walks onto this patch, a NEW candidate key is generated and displayed in the bottom-left.\n  - Step OFF the patch and then back ON to generate yet another candidate key; repeat to cycle through possibilities.\n  - You must keep cycling until the bottom-left candidate key EXACTLY matches the exit’s key (the same distribution of 0s and 9s seen within/adjacent to the 5s).\n* A reliable way to locate both the EXIT and the KEY GENERATOR area:\n  - Look for clusters of 0s and 9s reachable via 3s; if they are NOT framed by 5s, that area is most likely the generator. If you see 5s nearby framing a matching 0/9 pattern, that marks the exit.\n* When the pattern shown in the bottom-left matches the arrangement of 0s and 9s you see framed by (or adjacent to) 5s at the exit, move toward the 5s to complete the level.\n\n# HUD / PROGRESSION\n* Visual score on the second-to-last grid row (row 62): it contains several 4-cell “slots”.\n  - Slots made of 3s represent UNFINISHED levels.\n  - When a slot changes from 3s to another color, that level is COMPLETE.\n* Track remaining MOVES/ENERGY by counting tiles with value 15.\n* Track LIVES by counting distinct 2×2 blocks of 8s.\n\n# GENERAL NOTES\n* The grid is a bird’s-eye view.\n* If the grid does not change after an action, you likely attempted an illegal move into 4s.\n* Favor routes marked by 3s; scan for 0/9 patches (generator) and confirm exit by nearby 5s; confirm the key by matching the bottom-left blueprint of 0s/9s.\n\n# EXAMPLE STRATEGY OBSERVATION\nThe 8×8 player (top rows 12s, bottom rows 9s) is flush against 4s on the left, so LEFT is blocked. I can see a 0/9 patch reachable via 3s to the right (likely the generator) and some 5s beyond it, so I should move RIGHT toward that corridor, cycling the key on the generator until the bottom-left key matches the one at the exit.\n\n# TURN:\nCall exactly one action.\n"

    "content": "\n# CONTEXT:\nYou are an agent playing a dynamic game. Your objective is to\nWIN and avoid GAME_OVER while minimizing actions.\n\nOne action produces one Frame. One Frame is made of one or more sequential\nGrids. Each Grid is a matrix size INT<0,63> by INT<0,63> filled with\nINT<0,15> values. Each value represents a different color and usually implies a different object.\n\nYou are playing a game called LockSmith.\n\n# CONTROLS\n* RESET: start over\n* ACTION1: move up\n* ACTION2: move down\n* ACTION3: move left\n* ACTION4: move right\n* ACTION5/ACTION6: no-ops\n\n# GOAL\nFind/generate a key that MATCHES the key pattern shown at the EXIT, then navigate to the EXIT to finish the level.\nThere are 6 levels total. Complete all levels to WIN.\n\n# TILE MEANINGS (important ones)\n* 0 = white cell (used in key patterns)\n* 3 = walkable path / corridor marker (often outlines routes to key/exit)\n* 4 = WALL (solid). You cannot enter 4s.\n* 5 = EXIT indicator (presence of 5s marks/frames the exit area)\n* 8 = LIFE token (count lives as the number of 2×2 blocks of 8s)\n* 9 = blue cells (used in player lower body; also appear elsewhere in the map and in key logic)\n* 12 = orange cells (used in player upper body)\n* 15 = MOVE counter (number of 15s ≈ moves/energy left)\n\n# PLAYER (sprite + movement legality)\n* The player is an 8×8 sprite made ONLY of 12s (top two rows) over 9s (bottom six rows).\n  - Concretely: rows 0–1 (relative to the sprite) are all 12s; rows 2–7 are all 9s.\n  - Other scattered 9s on the board are NOT the player—only the exact 8×8 (2×8 of 12s stacked on 6×8 of 9s) is the player.\n* Movement rules:\n  - You may move only through non-4 cells (i.e., never overlap a 4 after a move).\n  - If any part of your 8×8 sprite would overlap a 4 in the target direction (including cases where 4s lie “under” 9s), that move is ILLEGAL.\n  - If your sprite is already touching 4s on a side, you cannot move further in that touching direction until you have clearance.\n  - Practically: navigate corridors “between the 4s”.\n\n# KEYS, EXIT, AND HOW TO FIND THEM\n* The EXIT contains (or is adjacent to) the target key pattern and is marked by nearby 5s (it need not be fully surrounded; any 5s strongly indicate the exit region).\n* The bottom-left of the entire grid shows the REQUIRED KEY BLUEPRINT you must match: a specific layout of 0s (white) and 9s (blue).\n* Key generation mechanism (explicit):\n  - The KEY GENERATOR is a field/patch consisting of 0s and 9s that is NOT surrounded by 5s (i.e., not the exit).\n  - When any part of your 8×8 player walks onto this patch, a NEW candidate key is generated and displayed in the bottom-left.\n  - Step OFF the patch and then back ON to generate yet another candidate key; repeat to cycle through possibilities.\n  - You must keep cycling until the bottom-left candidate key EXACTLY matches the exit’s key (the same distribution of 0s and 9s seen within/adjacent to the 5s).\n* A reliable way to locate both the EXIT and the KEY GENERATOR area:\n  - Look for clusters of 0s and 9s reachable via 3s; if they are NOT framed by 5s, that area is most likely the generator. If you see 5s nearby framing a matching 0/9 pattern, that marks the exit.\n* When the pattern shown in the bottom-left matches the arrangement of 0s and 9s you see framed by (or adjacent to) 5s at the exit, move toward the 5s to complete the level.\n\n# HUD / PROGRESSION\n* Visual score on the second-to-last grid row (row 62): it contains several 4-cell “slots”.\n  - Slots made of 3s represent UNFINISHED levels.\n  - When a slot changes from 3s to another color, that level is COMPLETE.\n* Track remaining MOVES/ENERGY by counting tiles with value 15.\n* Track LIVES by counting distinct 2×2 blocks of 8s.\n\n# GENERAL NOTES\n* The grid is a bird’s-eye view.\n* If the grid does not change after an action, you likely attempted an illegal move into 4s.\n* Favor routes marked by 3s; scan for 0/9 patches (generator) and confirm exit by nearby 5s; confirm the key by matching the bottom-left blueprint of 0s/9s.\n\n# EXAMPLE STRATEGY OBSERVATION\nThe 8×8 player (top rows 12s, bottom rows 9s) is flush against 4s on the left, so LEFT is blocked. I can see a 0/9 patch reachable via 3s to the right (likely the generator) and some 5s beyond it, so I should move RIGHT toward that corridor, cycling the key on the generator until the bottom-left key matches the one at the exit.\n\n# TURN:\nCall exactly one action.\n"

    "content": "- The frame shows a dense wall field (4s) with several walkable corridors marked by 3s carving a path through the maze. There’s a cluster of 0s and 9s in the lower-left quadrant that likely represents the KEY GENERATOR patch (not surrounded by 5s).\n- The EXIT region is suggested by nearby 5s—there’s a noticeable block of 5s toward the central-to-lower area, which should mark where you’ll need to finish once a key matches.\n- To progress safely, aim to move along the available 3s corridors toward the bottom-left generator patch. Step onto the 0/9 patch to generate a candidate key, then step off and back onto the patch to cycle through options. Continue cycling until the bottom-left blueprint (the required key pattern of 0s and 9s) matches the candidate key.\n- Once the generated key matches the exit’s pattern, head toward the 5s near the exit and complete the level. Throughout, avoid overlapping any 4s by staying within the 3-marked corridors."

    "content": "\n# CONTEXT:\nYou are an agent playing a dynamic game. Your objective is to\nWIN and avoid GAME_OVER while minimizing actions.\n\nOne action produces one Frame. One Frame is made of one or more sequential\nGrids. Each Grid is a matrix size INT<0,63> by INT<0,63> filled with\nINT<0,15> values. Each value represents a different color and usually implies a different object.\n\nYou are playing a game called LockSmith.\n\n# CONTROLS\n* RESET: start over\n* ACTION1: move up\n* ACTION2: move down\n* ACTION3: move left\n* ACTION4: move right\n* ACTION5/ACTION6: no-ops\n\n# GOAL\nFind/generate a key that MATCHES the key pattern shown at the EXIT, then navigate to the EXIT to finish the level.\nThere are 6 levels total. Complete all levels to WIN.\n\n# TILE MEANINGS (important ones)\n* 0 = white cell (used in key patterns)\n* 3 = walkable path / corridor marker (often outlines routes to key/exit)\n* 4 = WALL (solid). You cannot enter 4s.\n* 5 = EXIT indicator (presence of 5s marks/frames the exit area)\n* 8 = LIFE token (count lives as the number of 2×2 blocks of 8s)\n* 9 = blue cells (used in player lower body; also appear elsewhere in the map and in key logic)\n* 12 = orange cells (used in player upper body)\n* 15 = MOVE counter (number of 15s ≈ moves/energy left)\n\n# PLAYER (sprite + movement legality)\n* The player is an 8×8 sprite made ONLY of 12s (top two rows) over 9s (bottom six rows).\n  - Concretely: rows 0–1 (relative to the sprite) are all 12s; rows 2–7 are all 9s.\n  - Other scattered 9s on the board are NOT the player—only the exact 8×8 (2×8 of 12s stacked on 6×8 of 9s) is the player.\n* Movement rules:\n  - You may move only through non-4 cells (i.e., never overlap a 4 after a move).\n  - If any part of your 8×8 sprite would overlap a 4 in the target direction (including cases where 4s lie “under” 9s), that move is ILLEGAL.\n  - If your sprite is already touching 4s on a side, you cannot move further in that touching direction until you have clearance.\n  - Practically: navigate corridors “between the 4s”.\n\n# KEYS, EXIT, AND HOW TO FIND THEM\n* The EXIT contains (or is adjacent to) the target key pattern and is marked by nearby 5s (it need not be fully surrounded; any 5s strongly indicate the exit region).\n* The bottom-left of the entire grid shows the REQUIRED KEY BLUEPRINT you must match: a specific layout of 0s (white) and 9s (blue).\n* Key generation mechanism (explicit):\n  - The KEY GENERATOR is a field/patch consisting of 0s and 9s that is NOT surrounded by 5s (i.e., not the exit).\n  - When any part of your 8×8 player walks onto this patch, a NEW candidate key is generated and displayed in the bottom-left.\n  - Step OFF the patch and then back ON to generate yet another candidate key; repeat to cycle through possibilities.\n  - You must keep cycling until the bottom-left candidate key EXACTLY matches the exit’s key (the same distribution of 0s and 9s seen within/adjacent to the 5s).\n* A reliable way to locate both the EXIT and the KEY GENERATOR area:\n  - Look for clusters of 0s and 9s reachable via 3s; if they are NOT framed by 5s, that area is most likely the generator. If you see 5s nearby framing a matching 0/9 pattern, that marks the exit.\n* When the pattern shown in the bottom-left matches the arrangement of 0s and 9s you see framed by (or adjacent to) 5s at the exit, move toward the 5s to complete the level.\n\n# HUD / PROGRESSION\n* Visual score on the second-to-last grid row (row 62): it contains several 4-cell “slots”.\n  - Slots made of 3s represent UNFINISHED levels.\n  - When a slot changes from 3s to another color, that level is COMPLETE.\n* Track remaining MOVES/ENERGY by counting tiles with value 15.\n* Track LIVES by counting distinct 2×2 blocks of 8s.\n\n# GENERAL NOTES\n* The grid is a bird’s-eye view.\n* If the grid does not change after an action, you likely attempted an illegal move into 4s.\n* Favor routes marked by 3s; scan for 0/9 patches (generator) and confirm exit by nearby 5s; confirm the key by matching the bottom-left blueprint of 0s/9s.\n\n# EXAMPLE STRATEGY OBSERVATION\nThe 8×8 player (top rows 12s, bottom rows 9s) is flush against 4s on the left, so LEFT is blocked. I can see a 0/9 patch reachable via 3s to the right (likely the generator) and some 5s beyond it, so I should move RIGHT toward that corridor, cycling the key on the generator until the bottom-left key matches the one at the exit.\n\n# TURN:\nCall exactly one action.\n"

The bottom area shows dense walls with a corridor left to right, and a patch of 0/9 patterns likely indicating the KEY GENERATOR vicinity.\n- The EXIT region is indicated by nearby 5s, visible in the lower-middle area, suggesting the exit is not far from the generator but separated by walls you must thread carefully.\n- Plan: navigate along available 3s corridors toward the generator patch (the 0/9 cluster). Step onto the 0/9 patch to generate a candidate key, then step off and back onto it to cycle through keys. Repeat until the bottom-left blueprint of 0s/9s matches the exit’s key pattern, then head to the 5s denoting the exit. Throughout, avoid overlapping any 4s by staying within the 3-marked corridors."

    "content": "\n# CONTEXT:\nYou are an agent playing a dynamic game. Your objective is to\nWIN and avoid GAME_OVER while minimizing actions.\n\nOne action produces one Frame. One Frame is made of one or more sequential\nGrids. Each Grid is a matrix size INT<0,63> by INT<0,63> filled with\nINT<0,15> values. Each value represents a different color and usually implies a different object.\n\nYou are playing a game called LockSmith.\n\n# CONTROLS\n* RESET: start over\n* ACTION1: move up\n* ACTION2: move down\n* ACTION3: move left\n* ACTION4: move right\n* ACTION5/ACTION6: no-ops\n\n# GOAL\nFind/generate a key that MATCHES the key pattern shown at the EXIT, then navigate to the EXIT to finish the level.\nThere are 6 levels total. Complete all levels to WIN.\n\n# TILE MEANINGS (important ones)\n* 0 = white cell (used in key patterns)\n* 3 = walkable path / corridor marker (often outlines routes to key/exit)\n* 4 = WALL (solid). You cannot enter 4s.\n* 5 = EXIT indicator (presence of 5s marks/frames the exit area)\n* 8 = LIFE token (count lives as the number of 2×2 blocks of 8s)\n* 9 = blue cells (used in player lower body; also appear elsewhere in the map and in key logic)\n* 12 = orange cells (used in player upper body)\n* 15 = MOVE counter (number of 15s ≈ moves/energy left)\n\n# PLAYER (sprite + movement legality)\n* The player is an 8×8 sprite made ONLY of 12s (top two rows) over 9s (bottom six rows).\n  - Concretely: rows 0–1 (relative to the sprite) are all 12s; rows 2–7 are all 9s.\n  - Other scattered 9s on the board are NOT the player—only the exact 8×8 (2×8 of 12s stacked on 6×8 of 9s) is the player.\n* Movement rules:\n  - You may move only through non-4 cells (i.e., never overlap a 4 after a move).\n  - If any part of your 8×8 sprite would overlap a 4 in the target direction (including cases where 4s lie “under” 9s), that move is ILLEGAL.\n  - If your sprite is already touching 4s on a side, you cannot move further in that touching direction until you have clearance.\n  - Practically: navigate corridors “between the 4s”.\n\n# KEYS, EXIT, AND HOW TO FIND THEM\n* The EXIT contains (or is adjacent to) the target key pattern and is marked by nearby 5s (it need not be fully surrounded; any 5s strongly indicate the exit region).\n* The bottom-left of the entire grid shows the REQUIRED KEY BLUEPRINT you must match: a specific layout of 0s (white) and 9s (blue).\n* Key generation mechanism (explicit):\n  - The KEY GENERATOR is a field/patch consisting of 0s and 9s that is NOT surrounded by 5s (i.e., not the exit).\n  - When any part of your 8×8 player walks onto this patch, a NEW candidate key is generated and displayed in the bottom-left.\n  - Step OFF the patch and then back ON to generate yet another candidate key; repeat to cycle through possibilities.\n  - You must keep cycling until the bottom-left candidate key EXACTLY matches the exit’s key (the same distribution of 0s and 9s seen within/adjacent to the 5s).\n* A reliable way to locate both the EXIT and the KEY GENERATOR area:\n  - Look for clusters of 0s and 9s reachable via 3s; if they are NOT framed by 5s, that area is most likely the generator. If you see 5s nearby framing a matching 0/9 pattern, that marks the exit.\n* When the pattern shown in the bottom-left matches the arrangement of 0s and 9s you see framed by (or adjacent to) 5s at the exit, move toward the 5s to complete the level.\n\n# HUD / PROGRESSION\n* Visual score on the second-to-last grid row (row 62): it contains several 4-cell “slots”.\n  - Slots made of 3s represent UNFINISHED levels.\n  - When a slot changes from 3s to another color, that level is COMPLETE.\n* Track remaining MOVES/ENERGY by counting tiles with value 15.\n* Track LIVES by counting distinct 2×2 blocks of 8s.\n\n# GENERAL NOTES\n* The grid is a bird’s-eye view.\n* If the grid does not change after an action, you likely attempted an illegal move into 4s.\n* Favor routes marked by 3s; scan for 0/9 patches (generator) and confirm exit by nearby 5s; confirm the key by matching the bottom-left blueprint of 0s/9s.\n\n# EXAMPLE STRATEGY OBSERVATION\nThe 8×8 player (top rows 12s, bottom rows 9s) is flush against 4s on the left, so LEFT is blocked. I can see a 0/9 patch reachable via 3s to the right (likely the generator) and some 5s beyond it, so I should move RIGHT toward that corridor, cycling the key on the generator until the bottom-left key matches the one at the exit.\n\n# TURN:\nCall exactly one action.\n"

    "content": "\n# CONTEXT:\nYou are an agent playing a dynamic game. Your objective is to\nWIN and avoid GAME_OVER while minimizing actions.\n\nOne action produces one Frame. One Frame is made of one or more sequential\nGrids. Each Grid is a matrix size INT<0,63> by INT<0,63> filled with\nINT<0,15> values. Each value represents a different color and usually implies a different object.\n\nYou are playing a game called LockSmith.\n\n# CONTROLS\n* RESET: start over\n* ACTION1: move up\n* ACTION2: move down\n* ACTION3: move left\n* ACTION4: move right\n* ACTION5/ACTION6: no-ops\n\n# GOAL\nFind/generate a key that MATCHES the key pattern shown at the EXIT, then navigate to the EXIT to finish the level.\nThere are 6 levels total.

The bottom area shows dense walls with a corridor left to right, and a patch of 0/9 patterns likely indicating the KEY GENERATOR vicinity.\n- The EXIT region is indicated by nearby 5s, visible in the lower-middle area, suggesting the exit is not far from the generator but separated by walls you must thread carefully.\n- Plan: navigate along available 3s corridors toward the generator patch (the 0/9 cluster). Step onto the 0/9 patch to generate a candidate key, then step off and back onto it to cycle through keys. Repeat until the bottom-left blueprint of 0s/9s matches the exit’s key pattern, then head to the 5s denoting the exit. Throughout, avoid overlapping any 4s by staying within the 3-marked corridors."

    "content": "\n# CONTEXT:\nYou are an agent playing a dynamic game. Your objective is to\nWIN and avoid GAME_OVER while minimizing actions.\n\nOne action produces one Frame. One Frame is made of one or more sequential\nGrids. Each Grid is a matrix size INT<0,63> by INT<0,63> filled with\nINT<0,15> values. Each value represents a different color and usually implies a different object.\n\nYou are playing a game called LockSmith.\n\n# CONTROLS\n* RESET: start over\n* ACTION1: move up\n* ACTION2: move down\n* ACTION3: move left\n* ACTION4: move right\n* ACTION5/ACTION6: no-ops\n\n# GOAL\nFind/generate a key that MATCHES the key pattern shown at the EXIT, then navigate to the EXIT to finish the level.\nThere are 6 levels total. Complete all levels to WIN.\n\n# TILE MEANINGS (important ones)\n* 0 = white cell (used in key patterns)\n* 3 = walkable path / corridor marker (often outlines routes to key/exit)\n* 4 = WALL (solid). You cannot enter 4s.\n* 5 = EXIT indicator (presence of 5s marks/frames the exit area)\n* 8 = LIFE token (count lives as the number of 2×2 blocks of 8s)\n* 9 = blue cells (used in player lower body; also appear elsewhere in the map and in key logic)\n* 12 = orange cells (used in player upper body)\n* 15 = MOVE counter (number of 15s ≈ moves/energy left)\n\n# PLAYER (sprite + movement legality)\n* The player is an 8×8 sprite made ONLY of 12s (top two rows) over 9s (bottom six rows).\n  - Concretely: rows 0–1 (relative to the sprite) are all 12s; rows 2–7 are all 9s.\n  - Other scattered 9s on the board are NOT the player—only the exact 8×8 (2×8 of 12s stacked on 6×8 of 9s) is the player.\n* Movement rules:\n  - You may move only through non-4 cells (i.e., never overlap a 4 after a move).\n  - If any part of your 8×8 sprite would overlap a 4 in the target direction (including cases where 4s lie “under” 9s), that move is ILLEGAL.\n  - If your sprite is already touching 4s on a side, you cannot move further in that touching direction until you have clearance.\n  - Practically: navigate corridors “between the 4s”.\n\n# KEYS, EXIT, AND HOW TO FIND THEM\n* The EXIT contains (or is adjacent to) the target key pattern and is marked by nearby 5s (it need not be fully surrounded; any 5s strongly indicate the exit region).\n* The bottom-left of the entire grid shows the REQUIRED KEY BLUEPRINT you must match: a specific layout of 0s (white) and 9s (blue).\n* Key generation mechanism (explicit):\n  - The KEY GENERATOR is a field/patch consisting of 0s and 9s that is NOT surrounded by 5s (i.e., not the exit).\n  - When any part of your 8×8 player walks onto this patch, a NEW candidate key is generated and displayed in the bottom-left.\n  - Step OFF the patch and then back ON to generate yet another candidate key; repeat to cycle through possibilities.\n  - You must keep cycling until the bottom-left candidate key EXACTLY matches the exit’s key (the same distribution of 0s and 9s seen within/adjacent to the 5s).\n* A reliable way to locate both the EXIT and the KEY GENERATOR area:\n  - Look for clusters of 0s and 9s reachable via 3s; if they are NOT framed by 5s, that area is most likely the generator. If you see 5s nearby framing a matching 0/9 pattern, that marks the exit.\n* When the pattern shown in the bottom-left matches the arrangement of 0s and 9s you see framed by (or adjacent to) 5s at the exit, move toward the 5s to complete the level.\n\n# HUD / PROGRESSION\n* Visual score on the second-to-last grid row (row 62): it contains several 4-cell “slots”.\n  - Slots made of 3s represent UNFINISHED levels.\n  - When a slot changes from 3s to another color, that level is COMPLETE.\n* Track remaining MOVES/ENERGY by counting tiles with value 15.\n* Track LIVES by counting distinct 2×2 blocks of 8s.\n\n# GENERAL NOTES\n* The grid is a bird’s-eye view.\n* If the grid does not change after an action, you likely attempted an illegal move into 4s.\n* Favor routes marked by 3s; scan for 0/9 patches (generator) and confirm exit by nearby 5s; confirm the key by matching the bottom-left blueprint of 0s/9s.\n\n# EXAMPLE STRATEGY OBSERVATION\nThe 8×8 player (top rows 12s, bottom rows 9s) is flush against 4s on the left, so LEFT is blocked. I can see a 0/9 patch reachable via 3s to the right (likely the generator) and some 5s beyond it, so I should move RIGHT toward that corridor, cycling the key on the generator until the bottom-left key matches the one at the exit.\n\n# TURN:\nCall exactly one action.\n"

    "content": "\n# CONTEXT:\nYou are an agent playing a dynamic game. Your objective is to\nWIN and avoid GAME_OVER while minimizing actions.\n\nOne action produces one Frame. One Frame is made of one or more sequential\nGrids. Each Grid is a matrix size INT<0,63> by INT<0,63> filled with\nINT<0,15> values. Each value represents a different color and usually implies a different object.\n\nYou are playing a game called LockSmith.\n\n# CONTROLS\n* RESET: start over\n* ACTION1: move up\n* ACTION2: move down\n* ACTION3: move left\n* ACTION4: move right\n* ACTION5/ACTION6: no-ops\n\n# GOAL\nFind/generate a key that MATCHES the key pattern shown at the EXIT, then navigate to the EXIT to finish the level.\nThere are 6 levels total. Complete all levels to WIN.\n\n# TILE MEANINGS (important ones)\n* 0 = white cell (used in key patterns)\n* 3 = walkable path / corridor marker (often outlines routes to key/exit)\n* 4 = WALL (solid). You cannot enter 4s.\n* 5 = EXIT indicator (presence of 5s marks/frames the exit area)\n* 8 = LIFE token (count lives as the number of 2×2 blocks of 8s)\n* 9 = blue cells (used in player lower body; also appear elsewhere in the map and in key logic)\n* 12 = orange cells (used in player upper body)\n* 15 = MOVE counter (number of 15s ≈ moves/energy left)\n\n# PLAYER (sprite + movement legality)\n* The player is an 8×8 sprite made ONLY of 12s (top two rows) over 9s (bottom six rows).\n  - Concretely: rows 0–1 (relative to the sprite) are all 12s; rows 2–7 are all 9s.\n  - Other scattered 9s on the board are NOT the player—only the exact 8×8 (2×8 of 12s stacked on 6×8 of 9s) is the player.\n* Movement rules:\n  - You may move only through non-4 cells (i.e., never overlap a 4 after a move).\n  - If any part of your 8×8 sprite would overlap a 4 in the target direction (including cases where 4s lie “under” 9s), that move is ILLEGAL.\n  - If your sprite is already touching 4s on a side, you cannot move further in that touching direction until you have clearance.\n  - Practically: navigate corridors “between the 4s”.\n\n# KEYS, EXIT, AND HOW TO FIND THEM\n* The EXIT contains (or is adjacent to) the target key pattern and is marked by nearby 5s (it need not be fully surrounded; any 5s strongly indicate the exit region).\n* The bottom-left of the entire grid shows the REQUIRED KEY BLUEPRINT you must match: a specific layout of 0s (white) and 9s (blue).\n* Key generation mechanism (explicit):\n  - The KEY GENERATOR is a field/patch consisting of 0s and 9s that is NOT surrounded by 5s (i.e., not the exit).\n  - When any part of your 8×8 player walks onto this patch, a NEW candidate key is generated and displayed in the bottom-left.\n  - Step OFF the patch and then back ON to generate yet another candidate key; repeat to cycle through possibilities.\n  - You must keep cycling until the bottom-left candidate key EXACTLY matches the exit’s key (the same distribution of 0s and 9s seen within/adjacent to the 5s).\n* A reliable way to locate both the EXIT and the KEY GENERATOR area:\n  - Look for clusters of 0s and 9s reachable via 3s; if they are NOT framed by 5s, that area is most likely the generator. If you see 5s nearby framing a matching 0/9 pattern, that marks the exit.\n* When the pattern shown in the bottom-left matches the arrangement of 0s and 9s you see framed by (or adjacent to) 5s at the exit, move toward the 5s to complete the level.\n\n# HUD / PROGRESSION\n* Visual score on the second-to-last grid row (row 62): it contains several 4-cell “slots”.\n  - Slots made of 3s represent UNFINISHED levels.\n  - When a slot changes from 3s to another color, that level is COMPLETE.\n* Track remaining MOVES/ENERGY by counting tiles with value 15.\n* Track LIVES by counting distinct 2×2 blocks of 8s.\n\n# GENERAL NOTES\n* The grid is a bird’s-eye view.\n* If the grid does not change after an action, you likely attempted an illegal move into 4s.\n* Favor routes marked by 3s; scan for 0/9 patches (generator) and confirm exit by nearby 5s; confirm the key by matching the bottom-left blueprint of 0s/9s.\n\n# EXAMPLE STRATEGY OBSERVATION\nThe 8×8 player (top rows 12s, bottom rows 9s) is flush against 4s on the left, so LEFT is blocked. I can see a 0/9 patch reachable via 3s to the right (likely the generator) and some 5s beyond it, so I should move RIGHT toward that corridor, cycling the key on the generator until the bottom-left key matches the one at the exit.\n\n# TURN:\nCall exactly one action.\n"

    "content": "\n# CONTEXT:\nYou are an agent playing a dynamic game. Your objective is to\nWIN and avoid GAME_OVER while minimizing actions.\n\nOne action produces one Frame. One Frame is made of one or more sequential\nGrids. Each Grid is a matrix size INT<0,63> by INT<0,63> filled with\nINT<0,15> values. Each value represents a different color and usually implies a different object.\n\nYou are playing a game called LockSmith.\n\n# CONTROLS\n* RESET: start over\n* ACTION1: move up\n* ACTION2: move down\n* ACTION3: move left\n* ACTION4: move right\n* ACTION5/ACTION6: no-ops\n\n# GOAL\nFind/generate a key that MATCHES the key pattern shown at the EXIT, then navigate to the EXIT to finish the level.\nThere are 6 levels total. Complete all levels to WIN.\n\n# TILE MEANINGS (important ones)\n* 0 = white cell (used in key patterns)\n* 3 = walkable path / corridor marker (often outlines routes to key/exit)\n* 4 = WALL (solid). You cannot enter 4s.\n* 5 = EXIT indicator (presence of 5s marks/frames the exit area)\n* 8 = LIFE token (count lives as the number of 2×2 blocks of 8s)\n* 9 = blue cells (used in player lower body; also appear elsewhere in the map and in key logic)\n* 12 = orange cells (used in player upper body)\n* 15 = MOVE counter (number of 15s ≈ moves/energy left)\n\n# PLAYER (sprite + movement legality)\n* The player is an 8×8 sprite made ONLY of 12s (top two rows) over 9s (bottom six rows).\n  - Concretely: rows 0–1 (relative to the sprite) are all 12s; rows 2–7 are all 9s.\n  - Other scattered 9s on the board are NOT the player—only the exact 8×8 (2×8 of 12s stacked on 6×8 of 9s) is the player.\n* Movement rules:\n  - You may move only through non-4 cells (i.e., never overlap a 4 after a move).\n  - If any part of your 8×8 sprite would overlap a 4 in the target direction (including cases where 4s lie “under” 9s), that move is ILLEGAL.\n  - If your sprite is already touching 4s on a side, you cannot move further in that touching direction until you have clearance.\n  - Practically: navigate corridors “between the 4s”.\n\n# KEYS, EXIT, AND HOW TO FIND THEM\n* The EXIT contains (or is adjacent to) the target key pattern and is marked by nearby 5s (it need not be fully surrounded; any 5s strongly indicate the exit region).\n* The bottom-left of the entire grid shows the REQUIRED KEY BLUEPRINT you must match: a specific layout of 0s (white) and 9s (blue).\n* Key generation mechanism (explicit):\n  - The KEY GENERATOR is a field/patch consisting of 0s and 9s that is NOT surrounded by 5s (i.e., not the exit).\n  - When any part of your 8×8 player walks onto this patch, a NEW candidate key is generated and displayed in the bottom-left.\n  - Step OFF the patch and then back ON to generate yet another candidate key; repeat to cycle through possibilities.\n  - You must keep cycling until the bottom-left candidate key EXACTLY matches the exit’s key (the same distribution of 0s and 9s seen within/adjacent to the 5s).\n* A reliable way to locate both the EXIT and the KEY GENERATOR area:\n  - Look for clusters of 0s and 9s reachable via 3s; if they are NOT framed by 5s, that area is most likely the generator. If you see 5s nearby framing a matching 0/9 pattern, that marks the exit.\n* When the pattern shown in the bottom-left matches the arrangement of 0s and 9s you see framed by (or adjacent to) 5s at the exit, move toward the 5s to complete the level.\n\n# HUD / PROGRESSION\n* Visual score on the second-to-last grid row (row 62): it contains several 4-cell “slots”.\n  - Slots made of 3s represent UNFINISHED levels.\n  - When a slot changes from 3s to another color, that level is COMPLETE.\n* Track remaining MOVES/ENERGY by counting tiles with value 15.\n* Track LIVES by counting distinct 2×2 blocks of 8s.\n\n# GENERAL NOTES\n* The grid is a bird’s-eye view.\n* If the grid does not change after an action, you likely attempted an illegal move into 4s.\n* Favor routes marked by 3s; scan for 0/9 patches (generator) and confirm exit by nearby 5s; confirm the key by matching the bottom-left blueprint of 0s/9s.\n\n# EXAMPLE STRATEGY OBSERVATION\nThe 8×8 player (top rows 12s, bottom rows 9s) is flush against 4s on the left, so LEFT is blocked. I can see a 0/9 patch reachable via 3s to the right (likely the generator) and some 5s beyond it, so I should move RIGHT toward that corridor, cycling the key on the generator until the bottom-left key matches the one at the exit.\n\n# TURN:\nCall exactly one action.\n"

    "content": "\n# CONTEXT:\nYou are an agent playing a dynamic game. Your objective is to\nWIN and avoid GAME_OVER while minimizing actions.\n\nOne action produces one Frame. One Frame is made of one or more sequential\nGrids. Each Grid is a matrix size INT<0,63> by INT<0,63> filled with\nINT<0,15> values. Each value represents a different color and usually implies a different object.\n\nYou are playing a game called LockSmith.\n\n# CONTROLS\n* RESET: start over\n* ACTION1: move up\n* ACTION2: move down\n* ACTION3: move left\n* ACTION4: move right\n* ACTION5/ACTION6: no-ops\n\n# GOAL\nFind/generate a key that MATCHES the key pattern shown at the EXIT, then navigate to the EXIT to finish the level.\nThere are 6 levels total. Complete all levels to WIN.\n\n# TILE MEANINGS (important ones)\n* 0 = white cell (used in key patterns)\n* 3 = walkable path / corridor marker (often outlines routes to key/exit)\n* 4 = WALL (solid). You cannot enter 4s.\n* 5 = EXIT indicator (presence of 5s marks/frames the exit area)\n* 8 = LIFE token (count lives as the number of 2×2 blocks of 8s)\n* 9 = blue cells (used in player lower body; also appear elsewhere in the map and in key logic)\n* 12 = orange cells (used in player upper body)\n* 15 = MOVE counter (number of 15s ≈ moves/energy left)\n\n# PLAYER (sprite + movement legality)\n* The player is an 8×8 sprite made ONLY of 12s (top two rows) over 9s (bottom six rows).\n  - Concretely: rows 0–1 (relative to the sprite) are all 12s; rows 2–7 are all 9s.\n  - Other scattered 9s on the board are NOT the player—only the exact 8×8 (2×8 of 12s stacked on 6×8 of 9s) is the player.\n* Movement rules:\n  - You may move only through non-4 cells (i.e., never overlap a 4 after a move).\n  - If any part of your 8×8 sprite would overlap a 4 in the target direction (including cases where 4s lie “under” 9s), that move is ILLEGAL.\n  - If your sprite is already touching 4s on a side, you cannot move further in that touching direction until you have clearance.\n  - Practically: navigate corridors “between the 4s”.\n\n# KEYS, EXIT, AND HOW TO FIND THEM\n* The EXIT contains (or is adjacent to) the target key pattern and is marked by nearby 5s (it need not be fully surrounded; any 5s strongly indicate the exit region).\n* The bottom-left of the entire grid shows the REQUIRED KEY BLUEPRINT you must match: a specific layout of 0s (white) and 9s (blue).\n* Key generation mechanism (explicit):\n  - The KEY GENERATOR is a field/patch consisting of 0s and 9s that is NOT surrounded by 5s (i.e., not the exit).\n  - When any part of your 8×8 player walks onto this patch, a NEW candidate key is generated and displayed in the bottom-left.\n  - Step OFF the patch and then back ON to generate yet another candidate key; repeat to cycle through possibilities.\n  - You must keep cycling until the bottom-left candidate key EXACTLY matches the exit’s key (the same distribution of 0s and 9s seen within/adjacent to the 5s).\n* A reliable way to locate both the EXIT and the KEY GENERATOR area:\n  - Look for clusters of 0s and 9s reachable via 3s; if they are NOT framed by 5s, that area is most likely the generator. If you see 5s nearby framing a matching 0/9 pattern, that marks the exit.\n* When the pattern shown in the bottom-left matches the arrangement of 0s and 9s you see framed by (or adjacent to) 5s at the exit, move toward the 5s to complete the level.\n\n# HUD / PROGRESSION\n* Visual score on the second-to-last grid row (row 62): it contains several 4-cell “slots”.\n  - Slots made of 3s represent UNFINISHED levels.\n  - When a slot changes from 3s to another color, that level is COMPLETE.\n* Track remaining MOVES/ENERGY by counting tiles with value 15.\n* Track LIVES by counting distinct 2×2 blocks of 8s.\n\n# GENERAL NOTES\n* The grid is a bird’s-eye view.\n* If the grid does not change after an action, you likely attempted an illegal move into 4s.\n* Favor routes marked by 3s; scan for 0/9 patches (generator) and confirm exit by nearby 5s; confirm the key by matching the bottom-left blueprint of 0s/9s.\n\n# EXAMPLE STRATEGY OBSERVATION\nThe 8×8 player (top rows 12s, bottom rows 9s) is flush against 4s on the left, so LEFT is blocked. I can see a 0/9 patch reachable via 3s to the right (likely the generator) and some 5s beyond it, so I should move RIGHT toward that corridor, cycling the key on the generator until the bottom-left key matches the one at the exit.\n\n# TURN:\nCall exactly one action.\n"

    "content": "\n# CONTEXT:\nYou are an agent playing a dynamic game. Your objective is to\nWIN and avoid GAME_OVER while minimizing actions.\n\nOne action produces one Frame. One Frame is made of one or more sequential\nGrids. Each Grid is a matrix size INT<0,63> by INT<0,63> filled with\nINT<0,15> values. Each value represents a different color and usually implies a different object.\n\nYou are playing a game called LockSmith.\n\n# CONTROLS\n* RESET: start over\n* ACTION1: move up\n* ACTION2: move down\n* ACTION3: move left\n* ACTION4: move right\n* ACTION5/ACTION6: no-ops\n\n# GOAL\nFind/generate a key that MATCHES the key pattern shown at the EXIT, then navigate to the EXIT to finish the level.\nThere are 6 levels total. Complete all levels to WIN.\n\n# TILE MEANINGS (important ones)\n* 0 = white cell (used in key patterns)\n* 3 = walkable path / corridor marker (often outlines routes to key/exit)\n* 4 = WALL (solid). You cannot enter 4s.\n* 5 = EXIT indicator (presence of 5s marks/frames the exit area)\n* 8 = LIFE token (count lives as the number of 2×2 blocks of 8s)\n* 9 = blue cells (used in player lower body; also appear elsewhere in the map and in key logic)\n* 12 = orange cells (used in player upper body)\n* 15 = MOVE counter (number of 15s ≈ moves/energy left)\n\n# PLAYER (sprite + movement legality)\n* The player is an 8×8 sprite made ONLY of 12s (top two rows) over 9s (bottom six rows).\n  - Concretely: rows 0–1 (relative to the sprite) are all 12s; rows 2–7 are all 9s.\n  - Other scattered 9s on the board are NOT the player—only the exact 8×8 (2×8 of 12s stacked on 6×8 of 9s) is the player.\n* Movement rules:\n  - You may move only through non-4 cells (i.e., never overlap a 4 after a move).\n  - If any part of your 8×8 sprite would overlap a 4 in the target direction (including cases where 4s lie “under” 9s), that move is ILLEGAL.\n  - If your sprite is already touching 4s on a side, you cannot move further in that touching direction until you have clearance.\n  - Practically: navigate corridors “between the 4s”.\n\n# KEYS, EXIT, AND HOW TO FIND THEM\n* The EXIT contains (or is adjacent to) the target key pattern and is marked by nearby 5s (it need not be fully surrounded; any 5s strongly indicate the exit region).\n* The bottom-left of the entire grid shows the REQUIRED KEY BLUEPRINT you must match: a specific layout of 0s (white) and 9s (blue).\n* Key generation mechanism (explicit):\n  - The KEY GENERATOR is a field/patch consisting of 0s and 9s that is NOT surrounded by 5s (i.e., not the exit).\n  - When any part of your 8×8 player walks onto this patch, a NEW candidate key is generated and displayed in the bottom-left.\n  - Step OFF the patch and then back ON to generate yet another candidate key; repeat to cycle through possibilities.\n  - You must keep cycling until the bottom-left candidate key EXACTLY matches the exit’s key (the same distribution of 0s and 9s seen within/adjacent to the 5s).\n* A reliable way to locate both the EXIT and the KEY GENERATOR area:\n  - Look for clusters of 0s and 9s reachable via 3s; if they are NOT framed by 5s, that area is most likely the generator. If you see 5s nearby framing a matching 0/9 pattern, that marks the exit.\n* When the pattern shown in the bottom-left matches the arrangement of 0s and 9s you see framed by (or adjacent to) 5s at the exit, move toward the 5s to complete the level.\n\n# HUD / PROGRESSION\n* Visual score on the second-to-last grid row (row 62): it contains several 4-cell “slots”.\n  - Slots made of 3s represent UNFINISHED levels.\n  - When a slot changes from 3s to another color, that level is COMPLETE.\n* Track remaining MOVES/ENERGY by counting tiles with value 15.\n* Track LIVES by counting distinct 2×2 blocks of 8s.\n\n# GENERAL NOTES\n* The grid is a bird’s-eye view.\n* If the grid does not change after an action, you likely attempted an illegal move into 4s.\n* Favor routes marked by 3s; scan for 0/9 patches (generator) and confirm exit by nearby 5s; confirm the key by matching the bottom-left blueprint of 0s/9s.\n\n# EXAMPLE STRATEGY OBSERVATION\nThe 8×8 player (top rows 12s, bottom rows 9s) is flush against 4s on the left, so LEFT is blocked. I can see a 0/9 patch reachable via 3s to the right (likely the generator) and some 5s beyond it, so I should move RIGHT toward that corridor, cycling the key on the generator until the bottom-left key matches the one at the exit.\n\n# TURN:\nCall exactly one action.\n"

I can see a 0/9 patch reachable via 3s to the right (likely the generator) and some 5s beyond it, so I should move RIGHT toward that corridor, cycling the key on the generator until the bottom-left key matches the one at the exit.\n\n# TURN:\nCall exactly one action.\n"

If you see 5s nearby framing a matching 0/9 pattern, that marks the exit.\n* When the pattern shown in the bottom-left matches the arrangement of 0s and 9s you see framed by (or adjacent to) 5s at the exit, move toward the 5s to complete the level.\n\n# HUD / PROGRESSION\n* Visual score on the second-to-last grid row (row 62): it contains several 4-cell “slots”.\n  - Slots made of 3s represent UNFINISHED levels.\n  - When a slot changes from 3s to another color, that level is COMPLETE.\n* Track remaining MOVES/ENERGY by counting tiles with value 15.\n* Track LIVES by counting distinct 2×2 blocks of 8s.\n\n# GENERAL NOTES\n* The grid is a bird’s-eye view.\n* If the grid does not change after an action, you likely attempted an illegal move into 4s.\n* Favor routes marked by 3s; scan for 0/9 patches (generator) and confirm exit by nearby 5s; confirm the key by matching the bottom-left blueprint of 0s/9s.\n\n# EXAMPLE STRATEGY OBSERVATION\nThe 8×8 player (top rows 12s, bottom rows 9s) is flush against 4s on the left, so LEFT is blocked. I can see a 0/9 patch reachable via 3s to the right (likely the generator) and some 5s beyond it, so I should move RIGHT toward that corridor, cycling the key on the generator until the bottom-left key matches the one at the exit.\n\n# TURN:\nCall exactly one action.\n"

  "content": "Observation: The frame shows a mostly walled map with a clear corridor of 3s forming a route toward an area likely hosting the KEY GENERATOR. There are clusters of 4s forming walls on sides, so horizontal movement along the 3s corridor to the right appears legal. The bottom-left area contains the generic patch of 0/9s (potential key grid) that cycles when stepped on, but it’s not yet at the patch. The EXIT region will be indicated by nearby 5s, and the bottom-left blueprint of 0s/9s must match that exit key. Strategy: keep moving along the visible 3s corridor toward the generator, then cycle the key on/off by stepping onto the patch to generate a candidate key until it matches the exit blueprint."

    "content": "\n# CONTEXT:\nYou are an agent playing a dynamic game. Your objective is to\nWIN and avoid GAME_OVER while minimizing actions.\n\nOne action produces one Frame. One Frame is made of one or more sequential\nGrids. Each Grid is a matrix size INT<0,63> by INT<0,63> filled with\nINT<0,15> values. Each value represents a different color and usually implies a different object.\n\nYou are playing a game called LockSmith.\n\n# CONTROLS\n* RESET: start over\n* ACTION1: move up\n* ACTION2: move down\n* ACTION3: move left\n* ACTION4: move right\n* ACTION5/ACTION6: no-ops\n\n# GOAL\nFind/generate a key that MATCHES the key pattern shown at the EXIT, then navigate to the EXIT to finish the level.\nThere are 6 levels total. Complete all levels to WIN.\n\n# TILE MEANINGS (important ones)\n* 0 = white cell (used in key patterns)\n* 3 = walkable path / corridor marker (often outlines routes to key/exit)\n* 4 = WALL (solid). You cannot enter 4s.\n* 5 = EXIT indicator (presence of 5s marks/frames the exit area)\n* 8 = LIFE token (count lives as the number of 2×2 blocks of 8s)\n* 9 = blue cells (used in player lower body; also appear elsewhere in the map and in key logic)\n* 12 = orange cells (used in player upper body)\n* 15 = MOVE counter (number of 15s ≈ moves/energy left)\n\n# PLAYER (sprite + movement legality)\n* The player is an 8×8 sprite made ONLY of 12s (top two rows) over 9s (bottom six rows).\n  - Concretely: rows 0–1 (relative to the sprite) are all 12s; rows 2–7 are all 9s.\n  - Other scattered 9s on the board are NOT the player—only the exact 8×8 (2×8 of 12s stacked on 6×8 of 9s) is the player.\n* Movement rules:\n  - You may move only through non-4 cells (i.e., never overlap a 4 after a move).\n  - If any part of your 8×8 sprite would overlap a 4 in the target direction (including cases where 4s lie “under” 9s), that move is ILLEGAL.\n  - If your sprite is already touching 4s on a side, you cannot move further in that touching direction until you have clearance.\n  - Practically: navigate corridors “between the 4s”.\n\n# KEYS, EXIT, AND HOW TO FIND THEM\n* The EXIT contains (or is adjacent to) the target key pattern and is marked by nearby 5s (it need not be fully surrounded; any 5s strongly indicate the exit region).\n* The bottom-left of the entire grid shows the REQUIRED KEY BLUEPRINT you must match: a specific layout of 0s (white) and 9s (blue).\n* Key generation mechanism (explicit):\n  - The KEY GENERATOR is a field/patch consisting of 0s and 9s that is NOT surrounded by 5s (i.e., not the exit).\n  - When any part of your 8×8 player walks onto this patch, a NEW candidate key is generated and displayed in the bottom-left.\n  - Step OFF the patch and then back ON to generate yet another candidate key; repeat to cycle through possibilities.\n  - You must keep cycling until the bottom-left candidate key EXACTLY matches the exit’s key (the same distribution of 0s and 9s seen within/adjacent to the 5s).\n* A reliable way to locate both the EXIT and the KEY GENERATOR area:\n  - Look for clusters of 0s and 9s reachable via 3s; if they are NOT framed by 5s, that area is most likely the generator. If you see 5s nearby framing a matching 0/9 pattern, that marks the exit.\n* When the pattern shown in the bottom-left matches the arrangement of 0s and 9s you see framed by (or adjacent to) 5s at the exit, move toward the 5s to complete the level.\n\n# HUD / PROGRESSION\n* Visual score on the second-to-last grid row (row 62): it contains several 4-cell “slots”.\n  - Slots made of 3s represent UNFINISHED levels.\n  - When a slot changes from 3s to another color, that level is COMPLETE.\n* Track remaining MOVES/ENERGY by counting tiles with value 15.\n* Track LIVES by counting distinct 2×2 blocks of 8s.\n\n# GENERAL NOTES\n* The grid is a bird’s-eye view.\n* If the grid does not change after an action, you likely attempted an illegal move into 4s.\n* Favor routes marked by 3s; scan for 0/9 patches (generator) and confirm exit by nearby 5s; confirm the key by matching the bottom-left blueprint of 0s/9s.\n\n# EXAMPLE STRATEGY OBSERVATION\nThe 8×8 player (top rows 12s, bottom rows 9s) is flush against 4s on the left, so LEFT is blocked. I can see a 0/9 patch reachable via 3s to the right (likely the generator) and some 5s beyond it, so I should move RIGHT toward that corridor, cycling the key on the generator until the bottom-left key matches the one at the exit.\n\n# TURN:\nCall exactly one action.\n"

    "content": "\n# CONTEXT:\nYou are an agent playing a dynamic game. Your objective is to\nWIN and avoid GAME_OVER while minimizing actions.\n\nOne action produces one Frame. One Frame is made of one or more sequential\nGrids. Each Grid is a matrix size INT<0,63> by INT<0,63> filled with\nINT<0,15> values. Each value represents a different color and usually implies a different object.\n\nYou are playing a game called LockSmith.\n\n# CONTROLS\n* RESET: start over\n* ACTION1: move up\n* ACTION2: move down\n* ACTION3: move left\n* ACTION4: move right\n* ACTION5/ACTION6: no-ops\n\n# GOAL\nFind/generate a key that MATCHES the key pattern shown at the EXIT, then navigate to the EXIT to finish the level.\nThere are 6 levels total. Complete all levels to WIN.\n\n# TILE MEANINGS (important ones)\n* 0 = white cell (used in key patterns)\n* 3 = walkable path / corridor marker (often outlines routes to key/exit)\n* 4 = WALL (solid). You cannot enter 4s.\n* 5 = EXIT indicator (presence of 5s marks/frames the exit area)\n* 8 = LIFE token (count lives as the number of 2×2 blocks of 8s)\n* 9 = blue cells (used in player lower body; also appear elsewhere in the map and in key logic)\n* 12 = orange cells (used in player upper body)\n* 15 = MOVE counter (number of 15s ≈ moves/energy left)\n\n# PLAYER (sprite + movement legality)\n* The player is an 8×8 sprite made ONLY of 12s (top two rows) over 9s (bottom six rows).\n  - Concretely: rows 0–1 (relative to the sprite) are all 12s; rows 2–7 are all 9s.\n  - Other scattered 9s on the board are NOT the player—only the exact 8×8 (2×8 of 12s stacked on 6×8 of 9s) is the player.\n* Movement rules:\n  - You may move only through non-4 cells (i.e., never overlap a 4 after a move).\n  - If any part of your 8×8 sprite would overlap a 4 in the target direction (including cases where 4s lie “under” 9s), that move is ILLEGAL.\n  - If your sprite is already touching 4s on a side, you cannot move further in that touching direction until you have clearance.\n  - Practically: navigate corridors “between the 4s”.\n\n# KEYS, EXIT, AND HOW TO FIND THEM\n* The EXIT contains (or is adjacent to) the target key pattern and is marked by nearby 5s (it need not be fully surrounded; any 5s strongly indicate the exit region).\n* The bottom-left of the entire grid shows the REQUIRED KEY BLUEPRINT you must match: a specific layout of 0s (white) and 9s (blue).\n* Key generation mechanism (explicit):\n  - The KEY GENERATOR is a field/patch consisting of 0s and 9s that is NOT surrounded by 5s (i.e., not the exit).\n  - When any part of your 8×8 player walks onto this patch, a NEW candidate key is generated and displayed in the bottom-left.\n  - Step OFF the patch and then back ON to generate yet another candidate key; repeat to cycle through possibilities.\n  - You must keep cycling until the bottom-left candidate key EXACTLY matches the exit’s key (the same distribution of 0s and 9s seen within/adjacent to the 5s).\n* A reliable way to locate both the EXIT and the KEY GENERATOR area:\n  - Look for clusters of 0s and 9s reachable via 3s; if they are NOT framed by 5s, that area is most likely the generator. If you see 5s nearby framing a matching 0/9 pattern, that marks the exit.\n* When the pattern shown in the bottom-left matches the arrangement of 0s and 9s you see framed by (or adjacent to) 5s at the exit, move toward the 5s to complete the level.\n\n# HUD / PROGRESSION\n* Visual score on the second-to-last grid row (row 62): it contains several 4-cell “slots”.\n  - Slots made of 3s represent UNFINISHED levels.\n  - When a slot changes from 3s to another color, that level is COMPLETE.\n* Track remaining MOVES/ENERGY by counting tiles with value 15.\n* Track LIVES by counting distinct 2×2 blocks of 8s.\n\n# GENERAL NOTES\n* The grid is a bird’s-eye view.\n* If the grid does not change after an action, you likely attempted an illegal move into 4s.\n* Favor routes marked by 3s; scan for 0/9 patches (generator) and confirm exit by nearby 5s; confirm the key by matching the bottom-left blueprint of 0s/9s.\n\n# EXAMPLE STRATEGY OBSERVATION\nThe 8×8 player (top rows 12s, bottom rows 9s) is flush against 4s on the left, so LEFT is blocked. I can see a 0/9 patch reachable via 3s to the right (likely the generator) and some 5s beyond it, so I should move RIGHT toward that corridor, cycling the key on the generator until the bottom-left key matches the one at the exit.\n\n# TURN:\nCall exactly one action.\n"

    "content": "\n# CONTEXT:\nYou are an agent playing a dynamic game. Your objective is to\nWIN and avoid GAME_OVER while minimizing actions.\n\nOne action produces one Frame. One Frame is made of one or more sequential\nGrids. Each Grid is a matrix size INT<0,63> by INT<0,63> filled with\nINT<0,15> values. Each value represents a different color and usually implies a different object.\n\nYou are playing a game called LockSmith.\n\n# CONTROLS\n* RESET: start over\n* ACTION1: move up\n* ACTION2: move down\n* ACTION3: move left\n* ACTION4: move right\n* ACTION5/ACTION6: no-ops\n\n# GOAL\nFind/generate a key that MATCHES the key pattern shown at the EXIT, then navigate to the EXIT to finish the level.\nThere are 6 levels total. Complete all levels to WIN.\n\n# TILE MEANINGS (important ones)\n* 0 = white cell (used in key patterns)\n* 3 = walkable path / corridor marker (often outlines routes to key/exit)\n* 4 = WALL (solid). You cannot enter 4s.\n* 5 = EXIT indicator (presence of 5s marks/frames the exit area)\n* 8 = LIFE token (count lives as the number of 2×2 blocks of 8s)\n* 9 = blue cells (used in player lower body; also appear elsewhere in the map and in key logic)\n* 12 = orange cells (used in player upper body)\n* 15 = MOVE counter (number of 15s ≈ moves/energy left)\n\n# PLAYER (sprite + movement legality)\n* The player is an 8×8 sprite made ONLY of 12s (top two rows) over 9s (bottom six rows).\n  - Concretely: rows 0–1 (relative to the sprite) are all 12s; rows 2–7 are all 9s.\n  - Other scattered 9s on the board are NOT the player—only the exact 8×8 (2×8 of 12s stacked on 6×8 of 9s) is the player.\n* Movement rules:\n  - You may move only through non-4 cells (i.e., never overlap a 4 after a move).\n  - If any part of your 8×8 sprite would overlap a 4 in the target direction (including cases where 4s lie “under” 9s), that move is ILLEGAL.\n  - If your sprite is already touching 4s on a side, you cannot move further in that touching direction until you have clearance.\n  - Practically: navigate corridors “between the 4s”.\n\n# KEYS, EXIT, AND HOW TO FIND THEM\n* The EXIT contains (or is adjacent to) the target key pattern and is marked by nearby 5s (it need not be fully surrounded; any 5s strongly indicate the exit region).\n* The bottom-left of the entire grid shows the REQUIRED KEY BLUEPRINT you must match: a specific layout of 0s (white) and 9s (blue).\n* Key generation mechanism (explicit):\n  - The KEY GENERATOR is a field/patch consisting of 0s and 9s that is NOT surrounded by 5s (i.e., not the exit).\n  - When any part of your 8×8 player walks onto this patch, a NEW candidate key is generated and displayed in the bottom-left.\n  - Step OFF the patch and then back ON to generate yet another candidate key; repeat to cycle through possibilities.\n  - You must keep cycling until the bottom-left candidate key EXACTLY matches the exit’s key (the same distribution of 0s and 9s seen within/adjacent to the 5s).\n* A reliable way to locate both the EXIT and the KEY GENERATOR area:\n  - Look for clusters of 0s and 9s reachable via 3s; if they are NOT framed by 5s, that area is most likely the generator. If you see 5s nearby framing a matching 0/9 pattern, that marks the exit.\n* When the pattern shown in the bottom-left matches the arrangement of 0s and 9s you see framed by (or adjacent to) 5s at the exit, move toward the 5s to complete the level.\n\n# HUD / PROGRESSION\n* Visual score on the second-to-last grid row (row 62): it contains several 4-cell “slots”.\n  - Slots made of 3s represent UNFINISHED levels.\n  - When a slot changes from 3s to another color, that level is COMPLETE.\n* Track remaining MOVES/ENERGY by counting tiles with value 15.\n* Track LIVES by counting distinct 2×2 blocks of 8s.\n\n# GENERAL NOTES\n* The grid is a bird’s-eye view.\n* If the grid does not change after an action, you likely attempted an illegal move into 4s.\n* Favor routes marked by 3s; scan for 0/9 patches (generator) and confirm exit by nearby 5s; confirm the key by matching the bottom-left blueprint of 0s/9s.\n\n# EXAMPLE STRATEGY OBSERVATION\nThe 8×8 player (top rows 12s, bottom rows 9s) is flush against 4s on the left, so LEFT is blocked. I can see a 0/9 patch reachable via 3s to the right (likely the generator) and some 5s beyond it, so I should move RIGHT toward that corridor, cycling the key on the generator until the bottom-left key matches the one at the exit.\n\n# TURN:\nCall exactly one action.\n"

There is a bottom-left region containing 9s and 0s that likely forms the key blueprint area, and a generator patch (0/9) somewhere reachable via the 3s corridor. The EXIT area is not yet clearly visible in this frame, but nearby 5s would indicate it when approached. Strategy: navigate along the 3s corridor toward the generator patch to cycle candidate keys, stepping off and back onto the patch to generate new keys until the bottom-left blueprint matches the exit key. Once a match is achieved, move toward the 5s (exit) to complete the level."

    "content": "\n# CONTEXT:\nYou are an agent playing a dynamic game. Your objective is to\nWIN and avoid GAME_OVER while minimizing actions.\n\nOne action produces one Frame. One Frame is made of one or more sequential\nGrids. Each Grid is a matrix size INT<0,63> by INT<0,63> filled with\nINT<0,15> values. Each value represents a different color and usually implies a different object.\n\nYou are playing a game called LockSmith.\n\n# CONTROLS\n* RESET: start over\n* ACTION1: move up\n* ACTION2: move down\n* ACTION3: move left\n* ACTION4: move right\n* ACTION5/ACTION6: no-ops\n\n# GOAL\nFind/generate a key that MATCHES the key pattern shown at the EXIT, then navigate to the EXIT to finish the level.\nThere are 6 levels total. Complete all levels to WIN.\n\n# TILE MEANINGS (important ones)\n* 0 = white cell (used in key patterns)\n* 3 = walkable path / corridor marker (often outlines routes to key/exit)\n* 4 = WALL (solid). You cannot enter 4s.\n* 5 = EXIT indicator (presence of 5s marks/frames the exit area)\n* 8 = LIFE token (count lives as the number of 2×2 blocks of 8s)\n* 9 = blue cells (used in player lower body; also appear elsewhere in the map and in key logic)\n* 12 = orange cells (used in player upper body)\n* 15 = MOVE counter (number of 15s ≈ moves/energy left)\n\n# PLAYER (sprite + movement legality)\n* The player is an 8×8 sprite made ONLY of 12s (top two rows) over 9s (bottom six rows).\n  - Concretely: rows 0–1 (relative to the sprite) are all 12s; rows 2–7 are all 9s.\n  - Other scattered 9s on the board are NOT the player—only the exact 8×8 (2×8 of 12s stacked on 6×8 of 9s) is the player.\n* Movement rules:\n  - You may move only through non-4 cells (i.e., never overlap a 4 after a move).\n  - If any part of your 8×8 sprite would overlap a 4 in the target direction (including cases where 4s lie “under” 9s), that move is ILLEGAL.\n  - If your sprite is already touching 4s on a side, you cannot move further in that touching direction until you have clearance.\n  - Practically: navigate corridors “between the 4s”.\n\n# KEYS, EXIT, AND HOW TO FIND THEM\n* The EXIT contains (or is adjacent to) the target key pattern and is marked by nearby 5s (it need not be fully surrounded; any 5s strongly indicate the exit region).\n* The bottom-left of the entire grid shows the REQUIRED KEY BLUEPRINT you must match: a specific layout of 0s (white) and 9s (blue).\n* Key generation mechanism (explicit):\n  - The KEY GENERATOR is a field/patch consisting of 0s and 9s that is NOT surrounded by 5s (i.e., not the exit).\n  - When any part of your 8×8 player walks onto this patch, a NEW candidate key is generated and displayed in the bottom-left.\n  - Step OFF the patch and then back ON to generate yet another candidate key; repeat to cycle through possibilities.\n  - You must keep cycling until the bottom-left candidate key EXACTLY matches the exit’s key (the same distribution of 0s and 9s seen within/adjacent to the 5s).\n* A reliable way to locate both the EXIT and the KEY GENERATOR area:\n  - Look for clusters of 0s and 9s reachable via 3s; if they are NOT framed by 5s, that area is most likely the generator. If you see 5s nearby framing a matching 0/9 pattern, that marks the exit.\n* When the pattern shown in the bottom-left matches the arrangement of 0s and 9s you see framed by (or adjacent to) 5s at the exit, move toward the 5s to complete the level.\n\n# HUD / PROGRESSION\n* Visual score on the second-to-last grid row (row 62): it contains several 4-cell “slots”.\n  - Slots made of 3s represent UNFINISHED levels.\n  - When a slot changes from 3s to another color, that level is COMPLETE.\n* Track remaining MOVES/ENERGY by counting tiles with value 15.\n* Track LIVES by counting distinct 2×2 blocks of 8s.\n\n# GENERAL NOTES\n* The grid is a bird’s-eye view.\n* If the grid does not change after an action, you likely attempted an illegal move into 4s.\n* Favor routes marked by 3s; scan for 0/9 patches (generator) and confirm exit by nearby 5s; confirm the key by matching the bottom-left blueprint of 0s/9s.\n\n# EXAMPLE STRATEGY OBSERVATION\nThe 8×8 player (top rows 12s, bottom rows 9s) is flush against 4s on the left, so LEFT is blocked. I can see a 0/9 patch reachable via 3s to the right (likely the generator) and some 5s beyond it, so I should move RIGHT toward that corridor, cycling the key on the generator until the bottom-left key matches the one at the exit.\n\n# TURN:\nCall exactly one action.\n"

There is a bottom-left region containing 9s and 0s that likely forms the key blueprint area, and a generator patch (0/9) somewhere reachable via the 3s corridor. The EXIT area is not yet clearly visible in this frame, but nearby 5s would indicate it when approached. Strategy: navigate along the 3s corridor toward the generator patch to cycle candidate keys, stepping off and back onto the patch to generate new keys until the bottom-left blueprint matches the exit key. Once a match is achieved, move toward the 5s (exit) to complete the level."

    "content": "\n# CONTEXT:\nYou are an agent playing a dynamic game. Your objective is to\nWIN and avoid GAME_OVER while minimizing actions.\n\nOne action produces one Frame. One Frame is made of one or more sequential\nGrids. Each Grid is a matrix size INT<0,63> by INT<0,63> filled with\nINT<0,15> values. Each value represents a different color and usually implies a different object.\n\nYou are playing a game called LockSmith.\n\n# CONTROLS\n* RESET: start over\n* ACTION1: move up\n* ACTION2: move down\n* ACTION3: move left\n* ACTION4: move right\n* ACTION5/ACTION6: no-ops\n\n# GOAL\nFind/generate a key that MATCHES the key pattern shown at the EXIT, then navigate to the EXIT to finish the level.\nThere are 6 levels total. Complete all levels to WIN.\n\n# TILE MEANINGS (important ones)\n* 0 = white cell (used in key patterns)\n* 3 = walkable path / corridor marker (often outlines routes to key/exit)\n* 4 = WALL (solid). You cannot enter 4s.\n* 5 = EXIT indicator (presence of 5s marks/frames the exit area)\n* 8 = LIFE token (count lives as the number of 2×2 blocks of 8s)\n* 9 = blue cells (used in player lower body; also appear elsewhere in the map and in key logic)\n* 12 = orange cells (used in player upper body)\n* 15 = MOVE counter (number of 15s ≈ moves/energy left)\n\n# PLAYER (sprite + movement legality)\n* The player is an 8×8 sprite made ONLY of 12s (top two rows) over 9s (bottom six rows).\n  - Concretely: rows 0–1 (relative to the sprite) are all 12s; rows 2–7 are all 9s.\n  - Other scattered 9s on the board are NOT the player—only the exact 8×8 (2×8 of 12s stacked on 6×8 of 9s) is the player.\n* Movement rules:\n  - You may move only through non-4 cells (i.e., never overlap a 4 after a move).\n  - If any part of your 8×8 sprite would overlap a 4 in the target direction (including cases where 4s lie “under” 9s), that move is ILLEGAL.\n  - If your sprite is already touching 4s on a side, you cannot move further in that touching direction until you have clearance.\n  - Practically: navigate corridors “between the 4s”.\n\n# KEYS, EXIT, AND HOW TO FIND THEM\n* The EXIT contains (or is adjacent to) the target key pattern and is marked by nearby 5s (it need not be fully surrounded; any 5s strongly indicate the exit region).\n* The bottom-left of the entire grid shows the REQUIRED KEY BLUEPRINT you must match: a specific layout of 0s (white) and 9s (blue).\n* Key generation mechanism (explicit):\n  - The KEY GENERATOR is a field/patch consisting of 0s and 9s that is NOT surrounded by 5s (i.e., not the exit).\n  - When any part of your 8×8 player walks onto this patch, a NEW candidate key is generated and displayed in the bottom-left.\n  - Step OFF the patch and then back ON to generate yet another candidate key; repeat to cycle through possibilities.\n  - You must keep cycling until the bottom-left candidate key EXACTLY matches the exit’s key (the same distribution of 0s and 9s seen within/adjacent to the 5s).\n* A reliable way to locate both the EXIT and the KEY GENERATOR area:\n  - Look for clusters of 0s and 9s reachable via 3s; if they are NOT framed by 5s, that area is most likely the generator. If you see 5s nearby framing a matching 0/9 pattern, that marks the exit.\n* When the pattern shown in the bottom-left matches the arrangement of 0s and 9s you see framed by (or adjacent to) 5s at the exit, move toward the 5s to complete the level.\n\n# HUD / PROGRESSION\n* Visual score on the second-to-last grid row (row 62): it contains several 4-cell “slots”.\n  - Slots made of 3s represent UNFINISHED levels.\n  - When a slot changes from 3s to another color, that level is COMPLETE.\n* Track remaining MOVES/ENERGY by counting tiles with value 15.\n* Track LIVES by counting distinct 2×2 blocks of 8s.\n\n# GENERAL NOTES\n* The grid is a bird’s-eye view.\n* If the grid does not change after an action, you likely attempted an illegal move into 4s.\n* Favor routes marked by 3s; scan for 0/9 patches (generator) and confirm exit by nearby 5s; confirm the key by matching the bottom-left blueprint of 0s/9s.\n\n# EXAMPLE STRATEGY OBSERVATION\nThe 8×8 player (top rows 12s, bottom rows 9s) is flush against 4s on the left, so LEFT is blocked. I can see a 0/9 patch reachable via 3s to the right (likely the generator) and some 5s beyond it, so I should move RIGHT toward that corridor, cycling the key on the generator until the bottom-left key matches the one at the exit.\n\n# TURN:\nCall exactly one action.\n"

    "content": "Observation: The frame is mostly surrounded by walls (4s) with a clear corridor pattern of 3s near the middle, suggesting a playable path. There is a bottom-left region containing 9s and 0s that likely forms the key blueprint area, and a generator patch (0/9) somewhere reachable via the 3s corridor. The EXIT area is not yet clearly visible in this frame, but nearby 5s would indicate it when approached. Strategy: navigate along the 3s corridor toward the generator patch to cycle candidate keys, stepping off and back onto the patch to generate new keys until the bottom-left blueprint matches the exit key. Once a match is achieved, move toward the 5s (exit) to complete the level."

    "content": "\n# CONTEXT:\nYou are an agent playing a dynamic game. Your objective is to\nWIN and avoid GAME_OVER while minimizing actions.\n\nOne action produces one Frame. One Frame is made of one or more sequential\nGrids. Each Grid is a matrix size INT<0,63> by INT<0,63> filled with\nINT<0,15> values. Each value represents a different color and usually implies a different object.\n\nYou are playing a game called LockSmith.\n\n# CONTROLS\n* RESET: start over\n* ACTION1: move up\n* ACTION2: move down\n* ACTION3: move left\n* ACTION4: move right\n* ACTION5/ACTION6: no-ops\n\n# GOAL\nFind/generate a key that MATCHES the key pattern shown at the EXIT, then navigate to the EXIT to finish the level.\nThere are 6 levels total. Complete all levels to WIN.\n\n# TILE MEANINGS (important ones)\n* 0 = white cell (used in key patterns)\n* 3 = walkable path / corridor marker (often outlines routes to key/exit)\n* 4 = WALL (solid). You cannot enter 4s.\n* 5 = EXIT indicator (presence of 5s marks/frames the exit area)\n* 8 = LIFE token (count lives as the number of 2×2 blocks of 8s)\n* 9 = blue cells (used in player lower body; also appear elsewhere in the map and in key logic)\n* 12 = orange cells (used in player upper body)\n* 15 = MOVE counter (number of 15s ≈ moves/energy left)\n\n# PLAYER (sprite + movement legality)\n* The player is an 8×8 sprite made ONLY of 12s (top two rows) over 9s (bottom six rows).\n  - Concretely: rows 0–1 (relative to the sprite) are all 12s; rows 2–7 are all 9s.\n  - Other scattered 9s on the board are NOT the player—only the exact 8×8 (2×8 of 12s stacked on 6×8 of 9s) is the player.\n* Movement rules:\n  - You may move only through non-4 cells (i.e., never overlap a 4 after a move).\n  - If any part of your 8×8 sprite would overlap a 4 in the target direction (including cases where 4s lie “under” 9s), that move is ILLEGAL.\n  - If your sprite is already touching 4s on a side, you cannot move further in that touching direction until you have clearance.\n  - Practically: navigate corridors “between the 4s”.\n\n# KEYS, EXIT, AND HOW TO FIND THEM\n* The EXIT contains (or is adjacent to) the target key pattern and is marked by nearby 5s (it need not be fully surrounded; any 5s strongly indicate the exit region).\n* The bottom-left of the entire grid shows the REQUIRED KEY BLUEPRINT you must match: a specific layout of 0s (white) and 9s (blue).\n* Key generation mechanism (explicit):\n  - The KEY GENERATOR is a field/patch consisting of 0s and 9s that is NOT surrounded by 5s (i.e., not the exit).\n  - When any part of your 8×8 player walks onto this patch, a NEW candidate key is generated and displayed in the bottom-left.\n  - Step OFF the patch and then back ON to generate yet another candidate key; repeat to cycle through possibilities.\n  - You must keep cycling until the bottom-left candidate key EXACTLY matches the exit’s key (the same distribution of 0s and 9s seen within/adjacent to the 5s).\n* A reliable way to locate both the EXIT and the KEY GENERATOR area:\n  - Look for clusters of 0s and 9s reachable via 3s; if they are NOT framed by 5s, that area is most likely the generator. If you see 5s nearby framing a matching 0/9 pattern, that marks the exit.\n* When the pattern shown in the bottom-left matches the arrangement of 0s and 9s you see framed by (or adjacent to) 5s at the exit, move toward the 5s to complete the level.\n\n# HUD / PROGRESSION\n* Visual score on the second-to-last grid row (row 62): it contains several 4-cell “slots”.\n  - Slots made of 3s represent UNFINISHED levels.\n  - When a slot changes from 3s to another color, that level is COMPLETE.\n* Track remaining MOVES/ENERGY by counting tiles with value 15.\n* Track LIVES by counting distinct 2×2 blocks of 8s.\n\n# GENERAL NOTES\n* The grid is a bird’s-eye view.\n* If the grid does not change after an action, you likely attempted an illegal move into 4s.\n* Favor routes marked by 3s; scan for 0/9 patches (generator) and confirm exit by nearby 5s; confirm the key by matching the bottom-left blueprint of 0s/9s.\n\n# EXAMPLE STRATEGY OBSERVATION\nThe 8×8 player (top rows 12s, bottom rows 9s) is flush against 4s on the left, so LEFT is blocked. I can see a 0/9 patch reachable via 3s to the right (likely the generator) and some 5s beyond it, so I should move RIGHT toward that corridor, cycling the key on the generator until the bottom-left key matches the one at the exit.\n\n# TURN:\nCall exactly one action.\n"

    "content": "\n# CONTEXT:\nYou are an agent playing a dynamic game. Your objective is to\nWIN and avoid GAME_OVER while minimizing actions.\n\nOne action produces one Frame. One Frame is made of one or more sequential\nGrids. Each Grid is a matrix size INT<0,63> by INT<0,63> filled with\nINT<0,15> values. Each value represents a different color and usually implies a different object.\n\nYou are playing a game called LockSmith.\n\n# CONTROLS\n* RESET: start over\n* ACTION1: move up\n* ACTION2: move down\n* ACTION3: move left\n* ACTION4: move right\n* ACTION5/ACTION6: no-ops\n\n# GOAL\nFind/generate a key that MATCHES the key pattern shown at the EXIT, then navigate to the EXIT to finish the level.\nThere are 6 levels total. Complete all levels to WIN.\n\n# TILE MEANINGS (important ones)\n* 0 = white cell (used in key patterns)\n* 3 = walkable path / corridor marker (often outlines routes to key/exit)\n* 4 = WALL (solid). You cannot enter 4s.\n* 5 = EXIT indicator (presence of 5s marks/frames the exit area)\n* 8 = LIFE token (count lives as the number of 2×2 blocks of 8s)\n* 9 = blue cells (used in player lower body; also appear elsewhere in the map and in key logic)\n* 12 = orange cells (used in player upper body)\n* 15 = MOVE counter (number of 15s ≈ moves/energy left)\n\n# PLAYER (sprite + movement legality)\n* The player is an 8×8 sprite made ONLY of 12s (top two rows) over 9s (bottom six rows).\n  - Concretely: rows 0–1 (relative to the sprite) are all 12s; rows 2–7 are all 9s.\n  - Other scattered 9s on the board are NOT the player—only the exact 8×8 (2×8 of 12s stacked on 6×8 of 9s) is the player.\n* Movement rules:\n  - You may move only through non-4 cells (i.e., never overlap a 4 after a move).\n  - If any part of your 8×8 sprite would overlap a 4 in the target direction (including cases where 4s lie “under” 9s), that move is ILLEGAL.\n  - If your sprite is already touching 4s on a side, you cannot move further in that touching direction until you have clearance.\n  - Practically: navigate corridors “between the 4s”.\n\n# KEYS, EXIT, AND HOW TO FIND THEM\n* The EXIT contains (or is adjacent to) the target key pattern and is marked by nearby 5s (it need not be fully surrounded; any 5s strongly indicate the exit region).\n* The bottom-left of the entire grid shows the REQUIRED KEY BLUEPRINT you must match: a specific layout of 0s (white) and 9s (blue).\n* Key generation mechanism (explicit):\n  - The KEY GENERATOR is a field/patch consisting of 0s and 9s that is NOT surrounded by 5s (i.e., not the exit).\n  - When any part of your 8×8 player walks onto this patch, a NEW candidate key is generated and displayed in the bottom-left.\n  - Step OFF the patch and then back ON to generate yet another candidate key; repeat to cycle through possibilities.\n  - You must keep cycling until the bottom-left candidate key EXACTLY matches the exit’s key (the same distribution of 0s and 9s seen within/adjacent to the 5s).\n* A reliable way to locate both the EXIT and the KEY GENERATOR area:\n  - Look for clusters of 0s and 9s reachable via 3s; if they are NOT framed by 5s, that area is most likely the generator. If you see 5s nearby framing a matching 0/9 pattern, that marks the exit.\n* When the pattern shown in the bottom-left matches the arrangement of 0s and 9s you see framed by (or adjacent to) 5s at the exit, move toward the 5s to complete the level.\n\n# HUD / PROGRESSION\n* Visual score on the second-to-last grid row (row 62): it contains several 4-cell “slots”.\n  - Slots made of 3s represent UNFINISHED levels.\n  - When a slot changes from 3s to another color, that level is COMPLETE.\n* Track remaining MOVES/ENERGY by counting tiles with value 15.\n* Track LIVES by counting distinct 2×2 blocks of 8s.\n\n# GENERAL NOTES\n* The grid is a bird’s-eye view.\n* If the grid does not change after an action, you likely attempted an illegal move into 4s.\n* Favor routes marked by 3s; scan for 0/9 patches (generator) and confirm exit by nearby 5s; confirm the key by matching the bottom-left blueprint of 0s/9s.\n\n# EXAMPLE STRATEGY OBSERVATION\nThe 8×8 player (top rows 12s, bottom rows 9s) is flush against 4s on the left, so LEFT is blocked. I can see a 0/9 patch reachable via 3s to the right (likely the generator) and some 5s beyond it, so I should move RIGHT toward that corridor, cycling the key on the generator until the bottom-left key matches the one at the exit.\n\n# TURN:\nCall exactly one action.\n"

    "content": "\n# CONTEXT:\nYou are an agent playing a dynamic game. Your objective is to\nWIN and avoid GAME_OVER while minimizing actions.\n\nOne action produces one Frame. One Frame is made of one or more sequential\nGrids. Each Grid is a matrix size INT<0,63> by INT<0,63> filled with\nINT<0,15> values. Each value represents a different color and usually implies a different object.\n\nYou are playing a game called LockSmith.\n\n# CONTROLS\n* RESET: start over\n* ACTION1: move up\n* ACTION2: move down\n* ACTION3: move left\n* ACTION4: move right\n* ACTION5/ACTION6: no-ops\n\n# GOAL\nFind/generate a key that MATCHES the key pattern shown at the EXIT, then navigate to the EXIT to finish the level.\nThere are 6 levels total. Complete all levels to WIN.\n\n# TILE MEANINGS (important ones)\n* 0 = white cell (used in key patterns)\n* 3 = walkable path / corridor marker (often outlines routes to key/exit)\n* 4 = WALL (solid). You cannot enter 4s.\n* 5 = EXIT indicator (presence of 5s marks/frames the exit area)\n* 8 = LIFE token (count lives as the number of 2×2 blocks of 8s)\n* 9 = blue cells (used in player lower body; also appear elsewhere in the map and in key logic)\n* 12 = orange cells (used in player upper body)\n* 15 = MOVE counter (number of 15s ≈ moves/energy left)\n\n# PLAYER (sprite + movement legality)\n* The player is an 8×8 sprite made ONLY of 12s (top two rows) over 9s (bottom six rows).\n  - Concretely: rows 0–1 (relative to the sprite) are all 12s; rows 2–7 are all 9s.\n  - Other scattered 9s on the board are NOT the player—only the exact 8×8 (2×8 of 12s stacked on 6×8 of 9s) is the player.\n* Movement rules:\n  - You may move only through non-4 cells (i.e., never overlap a 4 after a move).\n  - If any part of your 8×8 sprite would overlap a 4 in the target direction (including cases where 4s lie “under” 9s), that move is ILLEGAL.\n  - If your sprite is already touching 4s on a side, you cannot move further in that touching direction until you have clearance.\n  - Practically: navigate corridors “between the 4s”.\n\n# KEYS, EXIT, AND HOW TO FIND THEM\n* The EXIT contains (or is adjacent to) the target key pattern and is marked by nearby 5s (it need not be fully surrounded; any 5s strongly indicate the exit region).\n* The bottom-left of the entire grid shows the REQUIRED KEY BLUEPRINT you must match: a specific layout of 0s (white) and 9s (blue).\n* Key generation mechanism (explicit):\n  - The KEY GENERATOR is a field/patch consisting of 0s and 9s that is NOT surrounded by 5s (i.e., not the exit).\n  - When any part of your 8×8 player walks onto this patch, a NEW candidate key is generated and displayed in the bottom-left.\n  - Step OFF the patch and then back ON to generate yet another candidate key; repeat to cycle through possibilities.\n  - You must keep cycling until the bottom-left candidate key EXACTLY matches the exit’s key (the same distribution of 0s and 9s seen within/adjacent to the 5s).\n* A reliable way to locate both the EXIT and the KEY GENERATOR area:\n  - Look for clusters of 0s and 9s reachable via 3s; if they are NOT framed by 5s, that area is most likely the generator. If you see 5s nearby framing a matching 0/9 pattern, that marks the exit.\n* When the pattern shown in the bottom-left matches the arrangement of 0s and 9s you see framed by (or adjacent to) 5s at the exit, move toward the 5s to complete the level.\n\n# HUD / PROGRESSION\n* Visual score on the second-to-last grid row (row 62): it contains several 4-cell “slots”.\n  - Slots made of 3s represent UNFINISHED levels.\n  - When a slot changes from 3s to another color, that level is COMPLETE.\n* Track remaining MOVES/ENERGY by counting tiles with value 15.\n* Track LIVES by counting distinct 2×2 blocks of 8s.\n\n# GENERAL NOTES\n* The grid is a bird’s-eye view.\n* If the grid does not change after an action, you likely attempted an illegal move into 4s.\n* Favor routes marked by 3s; scan for 0/9 patches (generator) and confirm exit by nearby 5s; confirm the key by matching the bottom-left blueprint of 0s/9s.\n\n# EXAMPLE STRATEGY OBSERVATION\nThe 8×8 player (top rows 12s, bottom rows 9s) is flush against 4s on the left, so LEFT is blocked. I can see a 0/9 patch reachable via 3s to the right (likely the generator) and some 5s beyond it, so I should move RIGHT toward that corridor, cycling the key on the generator until the bottom-left key matches the one at the exit.\n\n# TURN:\nCall exactly one action.\n"

Use this corridor to step onto the patch, then step off and back onto it to cycle candidate keys.\n- The bottom-left shows the required key blueprint (a specific 0/9 pattern); you must keep cycling on the generator until that bottom-left pattern exactly matches the exit’s key (which sits near nearby 5s).\n- Keep a safe route between walls: avoid any moves that would cause the 8×8 sprite to overlap a 4. Use the 3s corridors as the primary navigation guide, and head toward the generator first, then sweep keys until a match appears, finally approach the 5s exit to finish."

    "content": "\n# CONTEXT:\nYou are an agent playing a dynamic game. Your objective is to\nWIN and avoid GAME_OVER while minimizing actions.\n\nOne action produces one Frame. One Frame is made of one or more sequential\nGrids. Each Grid is a matrix size INT<0,63> by INT<0,63> filled with\nINT<0,15> values. Each value represents a different color and usually implies a different object.\n\nYou are playing a game called LockSmith.\n\n# CONTROLS\n* RESET: start over\n* ACTION1: move up\n* ACTION2: move down\n* ACTION3: move left\n* ACTION4: move right\n* ACTION5/ACTION6: no-ops\n\n# GOAL\nFind/generate a key that MATCHES the key pattern shown at the EXIT, then navigate to the EXIT to finish the level.\nThere are 6 levels total. Complete all levels to WIN.\n\n# TILE MEANINGS (important ones)\n* 0 = white cell (used in key patterns)\n* 3 = walkable path / corridor marker (often outlines routes to key/exit)\n* 4 = WALL (solid). You cannot enter 4s.\n* 5 = EXIT indicator (presence of 5s marks/frames the exit area)\n* 8 = LIFE token (count lives as the number of 2×2 blocks of 8s)\n* 9 = blue cells (used in player lower body; also appear elsewhere in the map and in key logic)\n* 12 = orange cells (used in player upper body)\n* 15 = MOVE counter (number of 15s ≈ moves/energy left)\n\n# PLAYER (sprite + movement legality)\n* The player is an 8×8 sprite made ONLY of 12s (top two rows) over 9s (bottom six rows).\n  - Concretely: rows 0–1 (relative to the sprite) are all 12s; rows 2–7 are all 9s.\n  - Other scattered 9s on the board are NOT the player—only the exact 8×8 (2×8 of 12s stacked on 6×8 of 9s) is the player.\n* Movement rules:\n  - You may move only through non-4 cells (i.e., never overlap a 4 after a move).\n  - If any part of your 8×8 sprite would overlap a 4 in the target direction (including cases where 4s lie “under” 9s), that move is ILLEGAL.\n  - If your sprite is already touching 4s on a side, you cannot move further in that touching direction until you have clearance.\n  - Practically: navigate corridors “between the 4s”.\n\n# KEYS, EXIT, AND HOW TO FIND THEM\n* The EXIT contains (or is adjacent to) the target key pattern and is marked by nearby 5s (it need not be fully surrounded; any 5s strongly indicate the exit region).\n* The bottom-left of the entire grid shows the REQUIRED KEY BLUEPRINT you must match: a specific layout of 0s (white) and 9s (blue).\n* Key generation mechanism (explicit):\n  - The KEY GENERATOR is a field/patch consisting of 0s and 9s that is NOT surrounded by 5s (i.e., not the exit).\n  - When any part of your 8×8 player walks onto this patch, a NEW candidate key is generated and displayed in the bottom-left.\n  - Step OFF the patch and then back ON to generate yet another candidate key; repeat to cycle through possibilities.\n  - You must keep cycling until the bottom-left candidate key EXACTLY matches the exit’s key (the same distribution of 0s and 9s seen within/adjacent to the 5s).\n* A reliable way to locate both the EXIT and the KEY GENERATOR area:\n  - Look for clusters of 0s and 9s reachable via 3s; if they are NOT framed by 5s, that area is most likely the generator. If you see 5s nearby framing a matching 0/9 pattern, that marks the exit.\n* When the pattern shown in the bottom-left matches the arrangement of 0s and 9s you see framed by (or adjacent to) 5s at the exit, move toward the 5s to complete the level.\n\n# HUD / PROGRESSION\n* Visual score on the second-to-last grid row (row 62): it contains several 4-cell “slots”.\n  - Slots made of 3s represent UNFINISHED levels.\n  - When a slot changes from 3s to another color, that level is COMPLETE.\n* Track remaining MOVES/ENERGY by counting tiles with value 15.\n* Track LIVES by counting distinct 2×2 blocks of 8s.\n\n# GENERAL NOTES\n* The grid is a bird’s-eye view.\n* If the grid does not change after an action, you likely attempted an illegal move into 4s.\n* Favor routes marked by 3s; scan for 0/9 patches (generator) and confirm exit by nearby 5s; confirm the key by matching the bottom-left blueprint of 0s/9s.\n\n# EXAMPLE STRATEGY OBSERVATION\nThe 8×8 player (top rows 12s, bottom rows 9s) is flush against 4s on the left, so LEFT is blocked. I can see a 0/9 patch reachable via 3s to the right (likely the generator) and some 5s beyond it, so I should move RIGHT toward that corridor, cycling the key on the generator until the bottom-left key matches the one at the exit.\n\n# TURN:\nCall exactly one action.\n"

  "content": "Current frame shows dense walls (4) around most of the grid with narrow corridors marked by 3s. The playable path appears to be a rightward corridor section near the lower-right area, where 0s and 9s form a patch (likely the KEY GENERATOR) and there are nearby 5s indicating the EXIT region. The 8×8 player is not yet visible in this summary, so assume we need to reposition along the 3-corridor to reach the generator patch without crossing any 4s. Plan: move RIGHT to slide along the visible 3s toward the generator patch, then step onto the patch to cycle a candidate key, step off, and repeat until the bottom-left blueprint of 0/9 matches the exit’s key, then head toward the nearby 5s to exit. Ensure no part of the sprite overlaps any 4s during movement."

    "content": "\n# CONTEXT:\nYou are an agent playing a dynamic game. Your objective is to\nWIN and avoid GAME_OVER while minimizing actions.\n\nOne action produces one Frame. One Frame is made of one or more sequential\nGrids. Each Grid is a matrix size INT<0,63> by INT<0,63> filled with\nINT<0,15> values. Each value represents a different color and usually implies a different object.\n\nYou are playing a game called LockSmith.\n\n# CONTROLS\n* RESET: start over\n* ACTION1: move up\n* ACTION2: move down\n* ACTION3: move left\n* ACTION4: move right\n* ACTION5/ACTION6: no-ops\n\n# GOAL\nFind/generate a key that MATCHES the key pattern shown at the EXIT, then navigate to the EXIT to finish the level.\nThere are 6 levels total. Complete all levels to WIN.\n\n# TILE MEANINGS (important ones)\n* 0 = white cell (used in key patterns)\n* 3 = walkable path / corridor marker (often outlines routes to key/exit)\n* 4 = WALL (solid). You cannot enter 4s.\n* 5 = EXIT indicator (presence of 5s marks/frames the exit area)\n* 8 = LIFE token (count lives as the number of 2×2 blocks of 8s)\n* 9 = blue cells (used in player lower body; also appear elsewhere in the map and in key logic)\n* 12 = orange cells (used in player upper body)\n* 15 = MOVE counter (number of 15s ≈ moves/energy left)\n\n# PLAYER (sprite + movement legality)\n* The player is an 8×8 sprite made ONLY of 12s (top two rows) over 9s (bottom six rows).\n  - Concretely: rows 0–1 (relative to the sprite) are all 12s; rows 2–7 are all 9s.\n  - Other scattered 9s on the board are NOT the player—only the exact 8×8 (2×8 of 12s stacked on 6×8 of 9s) is the player.\n* Movement rules:\n  - You may move only through non-4 cells (i.e., never overlap a 4 after a move).\n  - If any part of your 8×8 sprite would overlap a 4 in the target direction (including cases where 4s lie “under” 9s), that move is ILLEGAL.\n  - If your sprite is already touching 4s on a side, you cannot move further in that touching direction until you have clearance.\n  - Practically: navigate corridors “between the 4s”.\n\n# KEYS, EXIT, AND HOW TO FIND THEM\n* The EXIT contains (or is adjacent to) the target key pattern and is marked by nearby 5s (it need not be fully surrounded; any 5s strongly indicate the exit region).\n* The bottom-left of the entire grid shows the REQUIRED KEY BLUEPRINT you must match: a specific layout of 0s (white) and 9s (blue).\n* Key generation mechanism (explicit):\n  - The KEY GENERATOR is a field/patch consisting of 0s and 9s that is NOT surrounded by 5s (i.e., not the exit).\n  - When any part of your 8×8 player walks onto this patch, a NEW candidate key is generated and displayed in the bottom-left.\n  - Step OFF the patch and then back ON to generate yet another candidate key; repeat to cycle through possibilities.\n  - You must keep cycling until the bottom-left candidate key EXACTLY matches the exit’s key (the same distribution of 0s and 9s seen within/adjacent to the 5s).\n* A reliable way to locate both the EXIT and the KEY GENERATOR area:\n  - Look for clusters of 0s and 9s reachable via 3s; if they are NOT framed by 5s, that area is most likely the generator. If you see 5s nearby framing a matching 0/9 pattern, that marks the exit.\n* When the pattern shown in the bottom-left matches the arrangement of 0s and 9s you see framed by (or adjacent to) 5s at the exit, move toward the 5s to complete the level.\n\n# HUD / PROGRESSION\n* Visual score on the second-to-last grid row (row 62): it contains several 4-cell “slots”.\n  - Slots made of 3s represent UNFINISHED levels.\n  - When a slot changes from 3s to another color, that level is COMPLETE.\n* Track remaining MOVES/ENERGY by counting tiles with value 15.\n* Track LIVES by counting distinct 2×2 blocks of 8s.\n\n# GENERAL NOTES\n* The grid is a bird’s-eye view.\n* If the grid does not change after an action, you likely attempted an illegal move into 4s.\n* Favor routes marked by 3s; scan for 0/9 patches (generator) and confirm exit by nearby 5s; confirm the key by matching the bottom-left blueprint of 0s/9s.\n\n# EXAMPLE STRATEGY OBSERVATION\nThe 8×8 player (top rows 12s, bottom rows 9s) is flush against 4s on the left, so LEFT is blocked. I can see a 0/9 patch reachable via 3s to the right (likely the generator) and some 5s beyond it, so I should move RIGHT toward that corridor, cycling the key on the generator until the bottom-left key matches the one at the exit.\n\n# TURN:\nCall exactly one action.\n"

    "content": "\n# CONTEXT:\nYou are an agent playing a dynamic game. Your objective is to\nWIN and avoid GAME_OVER while minimizing actions.\n\nOne action produces one Frame. One Frame is made of one or more sequential\nGrids. Each Grid is a matrix size INT<0,63> by INT<0,63> filled with\nINT<0,15> values. Each value represents a different color and usually implies a different object.\n\nYou are playing a game called LockSmith.\n\n# CONTROLS\n* RESET: start over\n* ACTION1: move up\n* ACTION2: move down\n* ACTION3: move left\n* ACTION4: move right\n* ACTION5/ACTION6: no-ops\n\n# GOAL\nFind/generate a key that MATCHES the key pattern shown at the EXIT, then navigate to the EXIT to finish the level.\nThere are 6 levels total. Complete all levels to WIN.\n\n# TILE MEANINGS (important ones)\n* 0 = white cell (used in key patterns)\n* 3 = walkable path / corridor marker (often outlines routes to key/exit)\n* 4 = WALL (solid). You cannot enter 4s.\n* 5 = EXIT indicator (presence of 5s marks/frames the exit area)\n* 8 = LIFE token (count lives as the number of 2×2 blocks of 8s)\n* 9 = blue cells (used in player lower body; also appear elsewhere in the map and in key logic)\n* 12 = orange cells (used in player upper body)\n* 15 = MOVE counter (number of 15s ≈ moves/energy left)\n\n# PLAYER (sprite + movement legality)\n* The player is an 8×8 sprite made ONLY of 12s (top two rows) over 9s (bottom six rows).\n  - Concretely: rows 0–1 (relative to the sprite) are all 12s; rows 2–7 are all 9s.\n  - Other scattered 9s on the board are NOT the player—only the exact 8×8 (2×8 of 12s stacked on 6×8 of 9s) is the player.\n* Movement rules:\n  - You may move only through non-4 cells (i.e., never overlap a 4 after a move).\n  - If any part of your 8×8 sprite would overlap a 4 in the target direction (including cases where 4s lie “under” 9s), that move is ILLEGAL.\n  - If your sprite is already touching 4s on a side, you cannot move further in that touching direction until you have clearance.\n  - Practically: navigate corridors “between the 4s”.\n\n# KEYS, EXIT, AND HOW TO FIND THEM\n* The EXIT contains (or is adjacent to) the target key pattern and is marked by nearby 5s (it need not be fully surrounded; any 5s strongly indicate the exit region).\n* The bottom-left of the entire grid shows the REQUIRED KEY BLUEPRINT you must match: a specific layout of 0s (white) and 9s (blue).\n* Key generation mechanism (explicit):\n  - The KEY GENERATOR is a field/patch consisting of 0s and 9s that is NOT surrounded by 5s (i.e., not the exit).\n  - When any part of your 8×8 player walks onto this patch, a NEW candidate key is generated and displayed in the bottom-left.\n  - Step OFF the patch and then back ON to generate yet another candidate key; repeat to cycle through possibilities.\n  - You must keep cycling until the bottom-left candidate key EXACTLY matches the exit’s key (the same distribution of 0s and 9s seen within/adjacent to the 5s).\n* A reliable way to locate both the EXIT and the KEY GENERATOR area:\n  - Look for clusters of 0s and 9s reachable via 3s; if they are NOT framed by 5s, that area is most likely the generator. If you see 5s nearby framing a matching 0/9 pattern, that marks the exit.\n* When the pattern shown in the bottom-left matches the arrangement of 0s and 9s you see framed by (or adjacent to) 5s at the exit, move toward the 5s to complete the level.\n\n# HUD / PROGRESSION\n* Visual score on the second-to-last grid row (row 62): it contains several 4-cell “slots”.\n  - Slots made of 3s represent UNFINISHED levels.\n  - When a slot changes from 3s to another color, that level is COMPLETE.\n* Track remaining MOVES/ENERGY by counting tiles with value 15.\n* Track LIVES by counting distinct 2×2 blocks of 8s.\n\n# GENERAL NOTES\n* The grid is a bird’s-eye view.\n* If the grid does not change after an action, you likely attempted an illegal move into 4s.\n* Favor routes marked by 3s; scan for 0/9 patches (generator) and confirm exit by nearby 5s; confirm the key by matching the bottom-left blueprint of 0s/9s.\n\n# EXAMPLE STRATEGY OBSERVATION\nThe 8×8 player (top rows 12s, bottom rows 9s) is flush against 4s on the left, so LEFT is blocked. I can see a 0/9 patch reachable via 3s to the right (likely the generator) and some 5s beyond it, so I should move RIGHT toward that corridor, cycling the key on the generator until the bottom-left key matches the one at the exit.\n\n# TURN:\nCall exactly one action.\n"

    "content": "Current frame shows dense walls (4) around most of the grid with narrow corridors marked by 3s. The playable path appears to be a rightward corridor section near the lower-right area, where 0s and 9s form a patch (likely the KEY GENERATOR) and there are nearby 5s indicating the EXIT region. The 8×8 player is not yet visible in this summary, so assume we need to reposition along the 3-corridor to reach the generator patch without crossing any 4s. Plan: move RIGHT to slide along the visible 3s toward the generator patch, then step onto the patch to cycle a candidate key, step off, and repeat until the bottom-left blueprint of 0/9 matches the exit’s key, then head toward the nearby 5s to exit. Ensure no part of the sprite overlaps any 4s during movement."

    "content": "\n# CONTEXT:\nYou are an agent playing a dynamic game. Your objective is to\nWIN and avoid GAME_OVER while minimizing actions.\n\nOne action produces one Frame. One Frame is made of one or more sequential\nGrids. Each Grid is a matrix size INT<0,63> by INT<0,63> filled with\nINT<0,15> values. Each value represents a different color and usually implies a different object.\n\nYou are playing a game called LockSmith.\n\n# CONTROLS\n* RESET: start over\n* ACTION1: move up\n* ACTION2: move down\n* ACTION3: move left\n* ACTION4: move right\n* ACTION5/ACTION6: no-ops\n\n# GOAL\nFind/generate a key that MATCHES the key pattern shown at the EXIT, then navigate to the EXIT to finish the level.\nThere are 6 levels total. Complete all levels to WIN.\n\n# TILE MEANINGS (important ones)\n* 0 = white cell (used in key patterns)\n* 3 = walkable path / corridor marker (often outlines routes to key/exit)\n* 4 = WALL (solid). You cannot enter 4s.\n* 5 = EXIT indicator (presence of 5s marks/frames the exit area)\n* 8 = LIFE token (count lives as the number of 2×2 blocks of 8s)\n* 9 = blue cells (used in player lower body; also appear elsewhere in the map and in key logic)\n* 12 = orange cells (used in player upper body)\n* 15 = MOVE counter (number of 15s ≈ moves/energy left)\n\n# PLAYER (sprite + movement legality)\n* The player is an 8×8 sprite made ONLY of 12s (top two rows) over 9s (bottom six rows).\n  - Concretely: rows 0–1 (relative to the sprite) are all 12s; rows 2–7 are all 9s.\n  - Other scattered 9s on the board are NOT the player—only the exact 8×8 (2×8 of 12s stacked on 6×8 of 9s) is the player.\n* Movement rules:\n  - You may move only through non-4 cells (i.e., never overlap a 4 after a move).\n  - If any part of your 8×8 sprite would overlap a 4 in the target direction (including cases where 4s lie “under” 9s), that move is ILLEGAL.\n  - If your sprite is already touching 4s on a side, you cannot move further in that touching direction until you have clearance.\n  - Practically: navigate corridors “between the 4s”.\n\n# KEYS, EXIT, AND HOW TO FIND THEM\n* The EXIT contains (or is adjacent to) the target key pattern and is marked by nearby 5s (it need not be fully surrounded; any 5s strongly indicate the exit region).\n* The bottom-left of the entire grid shows the REQUIRED KEY BLUEPRINT you must match: a specific layout of 0s (white) and 9s (blue).\n* Key generation mechanism (explicit):\n  - The KEY GENERATOR is a field/patch consisting of 0s and 9s that is NOT surrounded by 5s (i.e., not the exit).\n  - When any part of your 8×8 player walks onto this patch, a NEW candidate key is generated and displayed in the bottom-left.\n  - Step OFF the patch and then back ON to generate yet another candidate key; repeat to cycle through possibilities.\n  - You must keep cycling until the bottom-left candidate key EXACTLY matches the exit’s key (the same distribution of 0s and 9s seen within/adjacent to the 5s).\n* A reliable way to locate both the EXIT and the KEY GENERATOR area:\n  - Look for clusters of 0s and 9s reachable via 3s; if they are NOT framed by 5s, that area is most likely the generator. If you see 5s nearby framing a matching 0/9 pattern, that marks the exit.\n* When the pattern shown in the bottom-left matches the arrangement of 0s and 9s you see framed by (or adjacent to) 5s at the exit, move toward the 5s to complete the level.\n\n# HUD / PROGRESSION\n* Visual score on the second-to-last grid row (row 62): it contains several 4-cell “slots”.\n  - Slots made of 3s represent UNFINISHED levels.\n  - When a slot changes from 3s to another color, that level is COMPLETE.\n* Track remaining MOVES/ENERGY by counting tiles with value 15.\n* Track LIVES by counting distinct 2×2 blocks of 8s.\n\n# GENERAL NOTES\n* The grid is a bird’s-eye view.\n* If the grid does not change after an action, you likely attempted an illegal move into 4s.\n* Favor routes marked by 3s; scan for 0/9 patches (generator) and confirm exit by nearby 5s; confirm the key by matching the bottom-left blueprint of 0s/9s.\n\n# EXAMPLE STRATEGY OBSERVATION\nThe 8×8 player (top rows 12s, bottom rows 9s) is flush against 4s on the left, so LEFT is blocked. I can see a 0/9 patch reachable via 3s to the right (likely the generator) and some 5s beyond it, so I should move RIGHT toward that corridor, cycling the key on the generator until the bottom-left key matches the one at the exit.\n\n# TURN:\nCall exactly one action.\n"

A 0/9 patch (generator) should be reachable along the rightward corridor, and there are 5s indicating the exit region nearby beyond that corridor. Plan: move right along the 3s toward the generator patch, stepping onto it to cycle a candidate key, then step off and back on to generate new keys until the bottom-left blueprint matches the exit key, then head toward the 5s/exit.\n\nAction: ACTION4 (move right)"

    "content": "\n# CONTEXT:\nYou are an agent playing a dynamic game. Your objective is to\nWIN and avoid GAME_OVER while minimizing actions.\n\nOne action produces one Frame. One Frame is made of one or more sequential\nGrids. Each Grid is a matrix size INT<0,63> by INT<0,63> filled with\nINT<0,15> values. Each value represents a different color and usually implies a different object.\n\nYou are playing a game called LockSmith.\n\n# CONTROLS\n* RESET: start over\n* ACTION1: move up\n* ACTION2: move down\n* ACTION3: move left\n* ACTION4: move right\n* ACTION5/ACTION6: no-ops\n\n# GOAL\nFind/generate a key that MATCHES the key pattern shown at the EXIT, then navigate to the EXIT to finish the level.\nThere are 6 levels total. Complete all levels to WIN.\n\n# TILE MEANINGS (important ones)\n* 0 = white cell (used in key patterns)\n* 3 = walkable path / corridor marker (often outlines routes to key/exit)\n* 4 = WALL (solid). You cannot enter 4s.\n* 5 = EXIT indicator (presence of 5s marks/frames the exit area)\n* 8 = LIFE token (count lives as the number of 2×2 blocks of 8s)\n* 9 = blue cells (used in player lower body; also appear elsewhere in the map and in key logic)\n* 12 = orange cells (used in player upper body)\n* 15 = MOVE counter (number of 15s ≈ moves/energy left)\n\n# PLAYER (sprite + movement legality)\n* The player is an 8×8 sprite made ONLY of 12s (top two rows) over 9s (bottom six rows).\n  - Concretely: rows 0–1 (relative to the sprite) are all 12s; rows 2–7 are all 9s.\n  - Other scattered 9s on the board are NOT the player—only the exact 8×8 (2×8 of 12s stacked on 6×8 of 9s) is the player.\n* Movement rules:\n  - You may move only through non-4 cells (i.e., never overlap a 4 after a move).\n  - If any part of your 8×8 sprite would overlap a 4 in the target direction (including cases where 4s lie “under” 9s), that move is ILLEGAL.\n  - If your sprite is already touching 4s on a side, you cannot move further in that touching direction until you have clearance.\n  - Practically: navigate corridors “between the 4s”.\n\n# KEYS, EXIT, AND HOW TO FIND THEM\n* The EXIT contains (or is adjacent to) the target key pattern and is marked by nearby 5s (it need not be fully surrounded; any 5s strongly indicate the exit region).\n* The bottom-left of the entire grid shows the REQUIRED KEY BLUEPRINT you must match: a specific layout of 0s (white) and 9s (blue).\n* Key generation mechanism (explicit):\n  - The KEY GENERATOR is a field/patch consisting of 0s and 9s that is NOT surrounded by 5s (i.e., not the exit).\n  - When any part of your 8×8 player walks onto this patch, a NEW candidate key is generated and displayed in the bottom-left.\n  - Step OFF the patch and then back ON to generate yet another candidate key; repeat to cycle through possibilities.\n  - You must keep cycling until the bottom-left candidate key EXACTLY matches the exit’s key (the same distribution of 0s and 9s seen within/adjacent to the 5s).\n* A reliable way to locate both the EXIT and the KEY GENERATOR area:\n  - Look for clusters of 0s and 9s reachable via 3s; if they are NOT framed by 5s, that area is most likely the generator. If you see 5s nearby framing a matching 0/9 pattern, that marks the exit.\n* When the pattern shown in the bottom-left matches the arrangement of 0s and 9s you see framed by (or adjacent to) 5s at the exit, move toward the 5s to complete the level.\n\n# HUD / PROGRESSION\n* Visual score on the second-to-last grid row (row 62): it contains several 4-cell “slots”.\n  - Slots made of 3s represent UNFINISHED levels.\n  - When a slot changes from 3s to another color, that level is COMPLETE.\n* Track remaining MOVES/ENERGY by counting tiles with value 15.\n* Track LIVES by counting distinct 2×2 blocks of 8s.\n\n# GENERAL NOTES\n* The grid is a bird’s-eye view.\n* If the grid does not change after an action, you likely attempted an illegal move into 4s.\n* Favor routes marked by 3s; scan for 0/9 patches (generator) and confirm exit by nearby 5s; confirm the key by matching the bottom-left blueprint of 0s/9s.\n\n# EXAMPLE STRATEGY OBSERVATION\nThe 8×8 player (top rows 12s, bottom rows 9s) is flush against 4s on the left, so LEFT is blocked. I can see a 0/9 patch reachable via 3s to the right (likely the generator) and some 5s beyond it, so I should move RIGHT toward that corridor, cycling the key on the generator until the bottom-left key matches the one at the exit.\n\n# TURN:\nCall exactly one action.\n"

One Frame is made of one or more sequential\nGrids. Each Grid is a matrix size INT<0,63> by INT<0,63> filled with\nINT<0,15> values. Each value represents a different color and usually implies a different object.\n\nYou are playing a game called LockSmith.\n\n# CONTROLS\n* RESET: start over\n* ACTION1: move up\n* ACTION2: move down\n* ACTION3: move left\n* ACTION4: move right\n* ACTION5/ACTION6: no-ops\n\n# GOAL\nFind/generate a key that MATCHES the key pattern shown at the EXIT, then navigate to the EXIT to finish the level.\nThere are 6 levels total. Complete all levels to WIN.\n\n# TILE MEANINGS (important ones)\n* 0 = white cell (used in key patterns)\n* 3 = walkable path / corridor marker (often outlines routes to key/exit)\n* 4 = WALL (solid).

    "content": "\n# CONTEXT:\nYou are an agent playing a dynamic game. Your objective is to\nWIN and avoid GAME_OVER while minimizing actions.\n\nOne action produces one Frame. One Frame is made of one or more sequential\nGrids. Each Grid is a matrix size INT<0,63> by INT<0,63> filled with\nINT<0,15> values. Each value represents a different color and usually implies a different object.\n\nYou are playing a game called LockSmith.\n\n# CONTROLS\n* RESET: start over\n* ACTION1: move up\n* ACTION2: move down\n* ACTION3: move left\n* ACTION4: move right\n* ACTION5/ACTION6: no-ops\n\n# GOAL\nFind/generate a key that MATCHES the key pattern shown at the EXIT, then navigate to the EXIT to finish the level.\nThere are 6 levels total. Complete all levels to WIN.\n\n# TILE MEANINGS (important ones)\n* 0 = white cell (used in key patterns)\n* 3 = walkable path / corridor marker (often outlines routes to key/exit)\n* 4 = WALL (solid). You cannot enter 4s.\n* 5 = EXIT indicator (presence of 5s marks/frames the exit area)\n* 8 = LIFE token (count lives as the number of 2×2 blocks of 8s)\n* 9 = blue cells (used in player lower body; also appear elsewhere in the map and in key logic)\n* 12 = orange cells (used in player upper body)\n* 15 = MOVE counter (number of 15s ≈ moves/energy left)\n\n# PLAYER (sprite + movement legality)\n* The player is an 8×8 sprite made ONLY of 12s (top two rows) over 9s (bottom six rows).\n  - Concretely: rows 0–1 (relative to the sprite) are all 12s; rows 2–7 are all 9s.\n  - Other scattered 9s on the board are NOT the player—only the exact 8×8 (2×8 of 12s stacked on 6×8 of 9s) is the player.\n* Movement rules:\n  - You may move only through non-4 cells (i.e., never overlap a 4 after a move).\n  - If any part of your 8×8 sprite would overlap a 4 in the target direction (including cases where 4s lie “under” 9s), that move is ILLEGAL.\n  - If your sprite is already touching 4s on a side, you cannot move further in that touching direction until you have clearance.\n  - Practically: navigate corridors “between the 4s”.\n\n# KEYS, EXIT, AND HOW TO FIND THEM\n* The EXIT contains (or is adjacent to) the target key pattern and is marked by nearby 5s (it need not be fully surrounded; any 5s strongly indicate the exit region).\n* The bottom-left of the entire grid shows the REQUIRED KEY BLUEPRINT you must match: a specific layout of 0s (white) and 9s (blue).\n* Key generation mechanism (explicit):\n  - The KEY GENERATOR is a field/patch consisting of 0s and 9s that is NOT surrounded by 5s (i.e., not the exit).\n  - When any part of your 8×8 player walks onto this patch, a NEW candidate key is generated and displayed in the bottom-left.\n  - Step OFF the patch and then back ON to generate yet another candidate key; repeat to cycle through possibilities.\n  - You must keep cycling until the bottom-left candidate key EXACTLY matches the exit’s key (the same distribution of 0s and 9s seen within/adjacent to the 5s).\n* A reliable way to locate both the EXIT and the KEY GENERATOR area:\n  - Look for clusters of 0s and 9s reachable via 3s; if they are NOT framed by 5s, that area is most likely the generator. If you see 5s nearby framing a matching 0/9 pattern, that marks the exit.\n* When the pattern shown in the bottom-left matches the arrangement of 0s and 9s you see framed by (or adjacent to) 5s at the exit, move toward the 5s to complete the level.\n\n# HUD / PROGRESSION\n* Visual score on the second-to-last grid row (row 62): it contains several 4-cell “slots”.\n  - Slots made of 3s represent UNFINISHED levels.\n  - When a slot changes from 3s to another color, that level is COMPLETE.\n* Track remaining MOVES/ENERGY by counting tiles with value 15.\n* Track LIVES by counting distinct 2×2 blocks of 8s.\n\n# GENERAL NOTES\n* The grid is a bird’s-eye view.\n* If the grid does not change after an action, you likely attempted an illegal move into 4s.\n* Favor routes marked by 3s; scan for 0/9 patches (generator) and confirm exit by nearby 5s; confirm the key by matching the bottom-left blueprint of 0s/9s.\n\n# EXAMPLE STRATEGY OBSERVATION\nThe 8×8 player (top rows 12s, bottom rows 9s) is flush against 4s on the left, so LEFT is blocked. I can see a 0/9 patch reachable via 3s to the right (likely the generator) and some 5s beyond it, so I should move RIGHT toward that corridor, cycling the key on the generator until the bottom-left key matches the one at the exit.\n\n# TURN:\nCall exactly one action.\n"

  "content": "Observations:\n- The frame shows a dense wall of 4s outlining the map edges, with several 3-path corridors cutting through, which likely lead to a generator patch (0s/9s) and the exit region marked by nearby 5s.\n- There is at least one visible cluster of 0s and 9s along a corridor to the right of the center, suggesting a candidate generator area. The exit (5s) appears to be somewhere beyond that area but still reachable via 3s.\n- The bottom-left blueprint (the required key pattern) will be revealed once we cycle keys by stepping on/off the generator patch. We should aim to step onto a 0/9 patch via a reachable 3-path and repeatedly toggle the patch to generate new candidate keys until the bottom-left matches the exit key.\nPlan:\n- Move along the accessible 3-path toward the right-side generator patch, avoiding any 4s.\n- Once on the patch, step off, then step back on to cycle candidate keys, watching the bottom-left display for an exact match to the exit key.\n- When a match occurs, navigate toward the nearby 5s to reach the exit and complete the level."

    "content": "\n# CONTEXT:\nYou are an agent playing a dynamic game. Your objective is to\nWIN and avoid GAME_OVER while minimizing actions.\n\nOne action produces one Frame. One Frame is made of one or more sequential\nGrids. Each Grid is a matrix size INT<0,63> by INT<0,63> filled with\nINT<0,15> values. Each value represents a different color and usually implies a different object.\n\nYou are playing a game called LockSmith.\n\n# CONTROLS\n* RESET: start over\n* ACTION1: move up\n* ACTION2: move down\n* ACTION3: move left\n* ACTION4: move right\n* ACTION5/ACTION6: no-ops\n\n# GOAL\nFind/generate a key that MATCHES the key pattern shown at the EXIT, then navigate to the EXIT to finish the level.\nThere are 6 levels total. Complete all levels to WIN.\n\n# TILE MEANINGS (important ones)\n* 0 = white cell (used in key patterns)\n* 3 = walkable path / corridor marker (often outlines routes to key/exit)\n* 4 = WALL (solid). You cannot enter 4s.\n* 5 = EXIT indicator (presence of 5s marks/frames the exit area)\n* 8 = LIFE token (count lives as the number of 2×2 blocks of 8s)\n* 9 = blue cells (used in player lower body; also appear elsewhere in the map and in key logic)\n* 12 = orange cells (used in player upper body)\n* 15 = MOVE counter (number of 15s ≈ moves/energy left)\n\n# PLAYER (sprite + movement legality)\n* The player is an 8×8 sprite made ONLY of 12s (top two rows) over 9s (bottom six rows).\n  - Concretely: rows 0–1 (relative to the sprite) are all 12s; rows 2–7 are all 9s.\n  - Other scattered 9s on the board are NOT the player—only the exact 8×8 (2×8 of 12s stacked on 6×8 of 9s) is the player.\n* Movement rules:\n  - You may move only through non-4 cells (i.e., never overlap a 4 after a move).\n  - If any part of your 8×8 sprite would overlap a 4 in the target direction (including cases where 4s lie “under” 9s), that move is ILLEGAL.\n  - If your sprite is already touching 4s on a side, you cannot move further in that touching direction until you have clearance.\n  - Practically: navigate corridors “between the 4s”.\n\n# KEYS, EXIT, AND HOW TO FIND THEM\n* The EXIT contains (or is adjacent to) the target key pattern and is marked by nearby 5s (it need not be fully surrounded; any 5s strongly indicate the exit region).\n* The bottom-left of the entire grid shows the REQUIRED KEY BLUEPRINT you must match: a specific layout of 0s (white) and 9s (blue).\n* Key generation mechanism (explicit):\n  - The KEY GENERATOR is a field/patch consisting of 0s and 9s that is NOT surrounded by 5s (i.e., not the exit).\n  - When any part of your 8×8 player walks onto this patch, a NEW candidate key is generated and displayed in the bottom-left.\n  - Step OFF the patch and then back ON to generate yet another candidate key; repeat to cycle through possibilities.\n  - You must keep cycling until the bottom-left candidate key EXACTLY matches the exit’s key (the same distribution of 0s and 9s seen within/adjacent to the 5s).\n* A reliable way to locate both the EXIT and the KEY GENERATOR area:\n  - Look for clusters of 0s and 9s reachable via 3s; if they are NOT framed by 5s, that area is most likely the generator. If you see 5s nearby framing a matching 0/9 pattern, that marks the exit.\n* When the pattern shown in the bottom-left matches the arrangement of 0s and 9s you see framed by (or adjacent to) 5s at the exit, move toward the 5s to complete the level.\n\n# HUD / PROGRESSION\n* Visual score on the second-to-last grid row (row 62): it contains several 4-cell “slots”.\n  - Slots made of 3s represent UNFINISHED levels.\n  - When a slot changes from 3s to another color, that level is COMPLETE.\n* Track remaining MOVES/ENERGY by counting tiles with value 15.\n* Track LIVES by counting distinct 2×2 blocks of 8s.\n\n# GENERAL NOTES\n* The grid is a bird’s-eye view.\n* If the grid does not change after an action, you likely attempted an illegal move into 4s.\n* Favor routes marked by 3s; scan for 0/9 patches (generator) and confirm exit by nearby 5s; confirm the key by matching the bottom-left blueprint of 0s/9s.\n\n# EXAMPLE STRATEGY OBSERVATION\nThe 8×8 player (top rows 12s, bottom rows 9s) is flush against 4s on the left, so LEFT is blocked. I can see a 0/9 patch reachable via 3s to the right (likely the generator) and some 5s beyond it, so I should move RIGHT toward that corridor, cycling the key on the generator until the bottom-left key matches the one at the exit.\n\n# TURN:\nCall exactly one action.\n"

    "content": "\n# CONTEXT:\nYou are an agent playing a dynamic game. Your objective is to\nWIN and avoid GAME_OVER while minimizing actions.\n\nOne action produces one Frame. One Frame is made of one or more sequential\nGrids. Each Grid is a matrix size INT<0,63> by INT<0,63> filled with\nINT<0,15> values. Each value represents a different color and usually implies a different object.\n\nYou are playing a game called LockSmith.\n\n# CONTROLS\n* RESET: start over\n* ACTION1: move up\n* ACTION2: move down\n* ACTION3: move left\n* ACTION4: move right\n* ACTION5/ACTION6: no-ops\n\n# GOAL\nFind/generate a key that MATCHES the key pattern shown at the EXIT, then navigate to the EXIT to finish the level.\nThere are 6 levels total. Complete all levels to WIN.\n\n# TILE MEANINGS (important ones)\n* 0 = white cell (used in key patterns)\n* 3 = walkable path / corridor marker (often outlines routes to key/exit)\n* 4 = WALL (solid). You cannot enter 4s.\n* 5 = EXIT indicator (presence of 5s marks/frames the exit area)\n* 8 = LIFE token (count lives as the number of 2×2 blocks of 8s)\n* 9 = blue cells (used in player lower body; also appear elsewhere in the map and in key logic)\n* 12 = orange cells (used in player upper body)\n* 15 = MOVE counter (number of 15s ≈ moves/energy left)\n\n# PLAYER (sprite + movement legality)\n* The player is an 8×8 sprite made ONLY of 12s (top two rows) over 9s (bottom six rows).\n  - Concretely: rows 0–1 (relative to the sprite) are all 12s; rows 2–7 are all 9s.\n  - Other scattered 9s on the board are NOT the player—only the exact 8×8 (2×8 of 12s stacked on 6×8 of 9s) is the player.\n* Movement rules:\n  - You may move only through non-4 cells (i.e., never overlap a 4 after a move).\n  - If any part of your 8×8 sprite would overlap a 4 in the target direction (including cases where 4s lie “under” 9s), that move is ILLEGAL.\n  - If your sprite is already touching 4s on a side, you cannot move further in that touching direction until you have clearance.\n  - Practically: navigate corridors “between the 4s”.\n\n# KEYS, EXIT, AND HOW TO FIND THEM\n* The EXIT contains (or is adjacent to) the target key pattern and is marked by nearby 5s (it need not be fully surrounded; any 5s strongly indicate the exit region).\n* The bottom-left of the entire grid shows the REQUIRED KEY BLUEPRINT you must match: a specific layout of 0s (white) and 9s (blue).\n* Key generation mechanism (explicit):\n  - The KEY GENERATOR is a field/patch consisting of 0s and 9s that is NOT surrounded by 5s (i.e., not the exit).\n  - When any part of your 8×8 player walks onto this patch, a NEW candidate key is generated and displayed in the bottom-left.\n  - Step OFF the patch and then back ON to generate yet another candidate key; repeat to cycle through possibilities.\n  - You must keep cycling until the bottom-left candidate key EXACTLY matches the exit’s key (the same distribution of 0s and 9s seen within/adjacent to the 5s).\n* A reliable way to locate both the EXIT and the KEY GENERATOR area:\n  - Look for clusters of 0s and 9s reachable via 3s; if they are NOT framed by 5s, that area is most likely the generator. If you see 5s nearby framing a matching 0/9 pattern, that marks the exit.\n* When the pattern shown in the bottom-left matches the arrangement of 0s and 9s you see framed by (or adjacent to) 5s at the exit, move toward the 5s to complete the level.\n\n# HUD / PROGRESSION\n* Visual score on the second-to-last grid row (row 62): it contains several 4-cell “slots”.\n  - Slots made of 3s represent UNFINISHED levels.\n  - When a slot changes from 3s to another color, that level is COMPLETE.\n* Track remaining MOVES/ENERGY by counting tiles with value 15.\n* Track LIVES by counting distinct 2×2 blocks of 8s.\n\n# GENERAL NOTES\n* The grid is a bird’s-eye view.\n* If the grid does not change after an action, you likely attempted an illegal move into 4s.\n* Favor routes marked by 3s; scan for 0/9 patches (generator) and confirm exit by nearby 5s; confirm the key by matching the bottom-left blueprint of 0s/9s.\n\n# EXAMPLE STRATEGY OBSERVATION\nThe 8×8 player (top rows 12s, bottom rows 9s) is flush against 4s on the left, so LEFT is blocked. I can see a 0/9 patch reachable via 3s to the right (likely the generator) and some 5s beyond it, so I should move RIGHT toward that corridor, cycling the key on the generator until the bottom-left key matches the one at the exit.\n\n# TURN:\nCall exactly one action.\n"

There is a prominent cluster of 5s near the right-to-center area indicating the exit region, and there are patches of 0/9 that likely serve as the KEY GENERATOR when touched by the 8×8 player.\n- The generator patch must be touched (step on and off) to cycle candidate keys, and we must match the bottom-left key blueprint (0s vs 9s) that is shown as the target.\n- Strategy: head along the visible rightward corridor (through 3s) to reach a generator patch, then repeatedly move off/on to cycle keys until the bottom-left blueprint exactly matches the exit’s key. Once matched, approach the 5s exit area to finish.\n\nRecommended next action: move RIGHT (ACTION4) to reach the generator/patch area and begin cycling the key."

    "content": "\n# CONTEXT:\nYou are an agent playing a dynamic game. Your objective is to\nWIN and avoid GAME_OVER while minimizing actions.\n\nOne action produces one Frame. One Frame is made of one or more sequential\nGrids. Each Grid is a matrix size INT<0,63> by INT<0,63> filled with\nINT<0,15> values. Each value represents a different color and usually implies a different object.\n\nYou are playing a game called LockSmith.\n\n# CONTROLS\n* RESET: start over\n* ACTION1: move up\n* ACTION2: move down\n* ACTION3: move left\n* ACTION4: move right\n* ACTION5/ACTION6: no-ops\n\n# GOAL\nFind/generate a key that MATCHES the key pattern shown at the EXIT, then navigate to the EXIT to finish the level.\nThere are 6 levels total. Complete all levels to WIN.\n\n# TILE MEANINGS (important ones)\n* 0 = white cell (used in key patterns)\n* 3 = walkable path / corridor marker (often outlines routes to key/exit)\n* 4 = WALL (solid). You cannot enter 4s.\n* 5 = EXIT indicator (presence of 5s marks/frames the exit area)\n* 8 = LIFE token (count lives as the number of 2×2 blocks of 8s)\n* 9 = blue cells (used in player lower body; also appear elsewhere in the map and in key logic)\n* 12 = orange cells (used in player upper body)\n* 15 = MOVE counter (number of 15s ≈ moves/energy left)\n\n# PLAYER (sprite + movement legality)\n* The player is an 8×8 sprite made ONLY of 12s (top two rows) over 9s (bottom six rows).\n  - Concretely: rows 0–1 (relative to the sprite) are all 12s; rows 2–7 are all 9s.\n  - Other scattered 9s on the board are NOT the player—only the exact 8×8 (2×8 of 12s stacked on 6×8 of 9s) is the player.\n* Movement rules:\n  - You may move only through non-4 cells (i.e., never overlap a 4 after a move).\n  - If any part of your 8×8 sprite would overlap a 4 in the target direction (including cases where 4s lie “under” 9s), that move is ILLEGAL.\n  - If your sprite is already touching 4s on a side, you cannot move further in that touching direction until you have clearance.\n  - Practically: navigate corridors “between the 4s”.\n\n# KEYS, EXIT, AND HOW TO FIND THEM\n* The EXIT contains (or is adjacent to) the target key pattern and is marked by nearby 5s (it need not be fully surrounded; any 5s strongly indicate the exit region).\n* The bottom-left of the entire grid shows the REQUIRED KEY BLUEPRINT you must match: a specific layout of 0s (white) and 9s (blue).\n* Key generation mechanism (explicit):\n  - The KEY GENERATOR is a field/patch consisting of 0s and 9s that is NOT surrounded by 5s (i.e., not the exit).\n  - When any part of your 8×8 player walks onto this patch, a NEW candidate key is generated and displayed in the bottom-left.\n  - Step OFF the patch and then back ON to generate yet another candidate key; repeat to cycle through possibilities.\n  - You must keep cycling until the bottom-left candidate key EXACTLY matches the exit’s key (the same distribution of 0s and 9s seen within/adjacent to the 5s).\n* A reliable way to locate both the EXIT and the KEY GENERATOR area:\n  - Look for clusters of 0s and 9s reachable via 3s; if they are NOT framed by 5s, that area is most likely the generator. If you see 5s nearby framing a matching 0/9 pattern, that marks the exit.\n* When the pattern shown in the bottom-left matches the arrangement of 0s and 9s you see framed by (or adjacent to) 5s at the exit, move toward the 5s to complete the level.\n\n# HUD / PROGRESSION\n* Visual score on the second-to-last grid row (row 62): it contains several 4-cell “slots”.\n  - Slots made of 3s represent UNFINISHED levels.\n  - When a slot changes from 3s to another color, that level is COMPLETE.\n* Track remaining MOVES/ENERGY by counting tiles with value 15.\n* Track LIVES by counting distinct 2×2 blocks of 8s.\n\n# GENERAL NOTES\n* The grid is a bird’s-eye view.\n* If the grid does not change after an action, you likely attempted an illegal move into 4s.\n* Favor routes marked by 3s; scan for 0/9 patches (generator) and confirm exit by nearby 5s; confirm the key by matching the bottom-left blueprint of 0s/9s.\n\n# EXAMPLE STRATEGY OBSERVATION\nThe 8×8 player (top rows 12s, bottom rows 9s) is flush against 4s on the left, so LEFT is blocked. I can see a 0/9 patch reachable via 3s to the right (likely the generator) and some 5s beyond it, so I should move RIGHT toward that corridor, cycling the key on the generator until the bottom-left key matches the one at the exit.\n\n# TURN:\nCall exactly one action.\n"

Once a matching key pattern is shown near the exit, proceed to the 5s exit to finish."

    "content": "\n# CONTEXT:\nYou are an agent playing a dynamic game. Your objective is to\nWIN and avoid GAME_OVER while minimizing actions.\n\nOne action produces one Frame. One Frame is made of one or more sequential\nGrids. Each Grid is a matrix size INT<0,63> by INT<0,63> filled with\nINT<0,15> values. Each value represents a different color and usually implies a different object.\n\nYou are playing a game called LockSmith.\n\n# CONTROLS\n* RESET: start over\n* ACTION1: move up\n* ACTION2: move down\n* ACTION3: move left\n* ACTION4: move right\n* ACTION5/ACTION6: no-ops\n\n# GOAL\nFind/generate a key that MATCHES the key pattern shown at the EXIT, then navigate to the EXIT to finish the level.\nThere are 6 levels total. Complete all levels to WIN.\n\n# TILE MEANINGS (important ones)\n* 0 = white cell (used in key patterns)\n* 3 = walkable path / corridor marker (often outlines routes to key/exit)\n* 4 = WALL (solid). You cannot enter 4s.\n* 5 = EXIT indicator (presence of 5s marks/frames the exit area)\n* 8 = LIFE token (count lives as the number of 2×2 blocks of 8s)\n* 9 = blue cells (used in player lower body; also appear elsewhere in the map and in key logic)\n* 12 = orange cells (used in player upper body)\n* 15 = MOVE counter (number of 15s ≈ moves/energy left)\n\n# PLAYER (sprite + movement legality)\n* The player is an 8×8 sprite made ONLY of 12s (top two rows) over 9s (bottom six rows).\n  - Concretely: rows 0–1 (relative to the sprite) are all 12s; rows 2–7 are all 9s.\n  - Other scattered 9s on the board are NOT the player—only the exact 8×8 (2×8 of 12s stacked on 6×8 of 9s) is the player.\n* Movement rules:\n  - You may move only through non-4 cells (i.e., never overlap a 4 after a move).\n  - If any part of your 8×8 sprite would overlap a 4 in the target direction (including cases where 4s lie “under” 9s), that move is ILLEGAL.\n  - If your sprite is already touching 4s on a side, you cannot move further in that touching direction until you have clearance.\n  - Practically: navigate corridors “between the 4s”.\n\n# KEYS, EXIT, AND HOW TO FIND THEM\n* The EXIT contains (or is adjacent to) the target key pattern and is marked by nearby 5s (it need not be fully surrounded; any 5s strongly indicate the exit region).\n* The bottom-left of the entire grid shows the REQUIRED KEY BLUEPRINT you must match: a specific layout of 0s (white) and 9s (blue).\n* Key generation mechanism (explicit):\n  - The KEY GENERATOR is a field/patch consisting of 0s and 9s that is NOT surrounded by 5s (i.e., not the exit).\n  - When any part of your 8×8 player walks onto this patch, a NEW candidate key is generated and displayed in the bottom-left.\n  - Step OFF the patch and then back ON to generate yet another candidate key; repeat to cycle through possibilities.\n  - You must keep cycling until the bottom-left candidate key EXACTLY matches the exit’s key (the same distribution of 0s and 9s seen within/adjacent to the 5s).\n* A reliable way to locate both the EXIT and the KEY GENERATOR area:\n  - Look for clusters of 0s and 9s reachable via 3s; if they are NOT framed by 5s, that area is most likely the generator. If you see 5s nearby framing a matching 0/9 pattern, that marks the exit.\n* When the pattern shown in the bottom-left matches the arrangement of 0s and 9s you see framed by (or adjacent to) 5s at the exit, move toward the 5s to complete the level.\n\n# HUD / PROGRESSION\n* Visual score on the second-to-last grid row (row 62): it contains several 4-cell “slots”.\n  - Slots made of 3s represent UNFINISHED levels.\n  - When a slot changes from 3s to another color, that level is COMPLETE.\n* Track remaining MOVES/ENERGY by counting tiles with value 15.\n* Track LIVES by counting distinct 2×2 blocks of 8s.\n\n# GENERAL NOTES\n* The grid is a bird’s-eye view.\n* If the grid does not change after an action, you likely attempted an illegal move into 4s.\n* Favor routes marked by 3s; scan for 0/9 patches (generator) and confirm exit by nearby 5s; confirm the key by matching the bottom-left blueprint of 0s/9s.\n\n# EXAMPLE STRATEGY OBSERVATION\nThe 8×8 player (top rows 12s, bottom rows 9s) is flush against 4s on the left, so LEFT is blocked. I can see a 0/9 patch reachable via 3s to the right (likely the generator) and some 5s beyond it, so I should move RIGHT toward that corridor, cycling the key on the generator until the bottom-left key matches the one at the exit.\n\n# TURN:\nCall exactly one action.\n"

One Frame is made of one or more sequential\nGrids. Each Grid is a matrix size INT<0,63> by INT<0,63> filled with\nINT<0,15> values. Each value represents a different color and usually implies a different object.\n\nYou are playing a game called LockSmith.\n\n# CONTROLS\n* RESET: start over\n* ACTION1: move up\n* ACTION2: move down\n* ACTION3: move left\n* ACTION4: move right\n* ACTION5/ACTION6: no-ops\n\n# GOAL\nFind/generate a key that MATCHES the key pattern shown at the EXIT, then navigate to the EXIT to finish the level.\nThere are 6 levels total. Complete all levels to WIN.\n\n# TILE MEANINGS (important ones)\n* 0 = white cell (used in key patterns)\n* 3 = walkable path / corridor marker (often outlines routes to key/exit)\n* 4 = WALL (solid). You cannot enter 4s.\n* 5 = EXIT indicator (presence of 5s marks/frames the exit area)\n* 8 = LIFE token (count lives as the number of 2×2 blocks of 8s)\n* 9 = blue cells (used in player lower body; also appear elsewhere in the map and in key logic)\n* 12 = orange cells (used in player upper body)\n* 15 = MOVE counter (number of 15s ≈ moves/energy left)\n\n# PLAYER (sprite + movement legality)\n* The player is an 8×8 sprite made ONLY of 12s (top two rows) over 9s (bottom six rows).\n  - Concretely: rows 0–1 (relative to the sprite) are all 12s; rows 2–7 are all 9s.\n  - Other scattered 9s on the board are NOT the player—only the exact 8×8 (2×8 of 12s stacked on 6×8 of 9s) is the player.\n* Movement rules:\n  - You may move only through non-4 cells (i.e., never overlap a 4 after a move).\n  - If any part of your 8×8 sprite would overlap a 4 in the target direction (including cases where 4s lie “under” 9s), that move is ILLEGAL.\n  - If your sprite is already touching 4s on a side, you cannot move further in that touching direction until you have clearance.\n  - Practically: navigate corridors “between the 4s”.\n\n# KEYS, EXIT, AND HOW TO FIND THEM\n* The EXIT contains (or is adjacent to) the target key pattern and is marked by nearby 5s (it need not be fully surrounded; any 5s strongly indicate the exit region).\n* The bottom-left of the entire grid shows the REQUIRED KEY BLUEPRINT you must match: a specific layout of 0s (white) and 9s (blue).\n* Key generation mechanism (explicit):\n  - The KEY GENERATOR is a field/patch consisting of 0s and 9s that is NOT surrounded by 5s (i.e., not the exit).\n  - When any part of your 8×8 player walks onto this patch, a NEW candidate key is generated and displayed in the bottom-left.\n  - Step OFF the patch and then back ON to generate yet another candidate key; repeat to cycle through possibilities.\n  - You must keep cycling until the bottom-left candidate key EXACTLY matches the exit’s key (the same distribution of 0s and 9s seen within/adjacent to the 5s).\n* A reliable way to locate both the EXIT and the KEY GENERATOR area:\n  - Look for clusters of 0s and 9s reachable via 3s; if they are NOT framed by 5s, that area is most likely the generator. If you see 5s nearby framing a matching 0/9 pattern, that marks the exit.\n* When the pattern shown in the bottom-left matches the arrangement of 0s and 9s you see framed by (or adjacent to) 5s at the exit, move toward the 5s to complete the level.\n\n# HUD / PROGRESSION\n* Visual score on the second-to-last grid row (row 62): it contains several 4-cell “slots”.\n  - Slots made of 3s represent UNFINISHED levels.\n  - When a slot changes from 3s to another color, that level is COMPLETE.\n* Track remaining MOVES/ENERGY by counting tiles with value 15.\n* Track LIVES by counting distinct 2×2 blocks of 8s.\n\n# GENERAL NOTES\n* The grid is a bird’s-eye view.\n* If the grid does not change after an action, you likely attempted an illegal move into 4s.\n* Favor routes marked by 3s; scan for 0/9 patches (generator) and confirm exit by nearby 5s; confirm the key by matching the bottom-left blueprint of 0s/9s.\n\n# EXAMPLE STRATEGY OBSERVATION\nThe 8×8 player (top rows 12s, bottom rows 9s) is flush against 4s on the left, so LEFT is blocked. I can see a 0/9 patch reachable via 3s to the right (likely the generator) and some 5s beyond it, so I should move RIGHT toward that corridor, cycling the key on the generator until the bottom-left key matches the one at the exit.\n\n# TURN:\nCall exactly one action.\n"

You cannot enter 4s.\n* 5 = EXIT indicator (presence of 5s marks/frames the exit area)\n* 8 = LIFE token (count lives as the number of 2×2 blocks of 8s)\n* 9 = blue cells (used in player lower body; also appear elsewhere in the map and in key logic)\n* 12 = orange cells (used in player upper body)\n* 15 = MOVE counter (number of 15s ≈ moves/energy left)\n\n# PLAYER (sprite + movement legality)\n* The player is an 8×8 sprite made ONLY of 12s (top two rows) over 9s (bottom six rows).\n  - Concretely: rows 0–1 (relative to the sprite) are all 12s; rows 2–7 are all 9s.\n  - Other scattered 9s on the board are NOT the player—only the exact 8×8 (2×8 of 12s stacked on 6×8 of 9s) is the player.\n* Movement rules:\n  - You may move only through non-4 cells (i.e., never overlap a 4 after a move).\n  - If any part of your 8×8 sprite would overlap a 4 in the target direction (including cases where 4s lie “under” 9s), that move is ILLEGAL.\n  - If your sprite is already touching 4s on a side, you cannot move further in that touching direction until you have clearance.\n  - Practically: navigate corridors “between the 4s”.\n\n# KEYS, EXIT, AND HOW TO FIND THEM\n* The EXIT contains (or is adjacent to) the target key pattern and is marked by nearby 5s (it need not be fully surrounded; any 5s strongly indicate the exit region).\n* The bottom-left of the entire grid shows the REQUIRED KEY BLUEPRINT you must match: a specific layout of 0s (white) and 9s (blue).\n* Key generation mechanism (explicit):\n  - The KEY GENERATOR is a field/patch consisting of 0s and 9s that is NOT surrounded by 5s (i.e., not the exit).\n  - When any part of your 8×8 player walks onto this patch, a NEW candidate key is generated and displayed in the bottom-left.\n  - Step OFF the patch and then back ON to generate yet another candidate key; repeat to cycle through possibilities.\n  - You must keep cycling until the bottom-left candidate key EXACTLY matches the exit’s key (the same distribution of 0s and 9s seen within/adjacent to the 5s).\n* A reliable way to locate both the EXIT and the KEY GENERATOR area:\n  - Look for clusters of 0s and 9s reachable via 3s; if they are NOT framed by 5s, that area is most likely the generator. If you see 5s nearby framing a matching 0/9 pattern, that marks the exit.\n* When the pattern shown in the bottom-left matches the arrangement of 0s and 9s you see framed by (or adjacent to) 5s at the exit, move toward the 5s to complete the level.\n\n# HUD / PROGRESSION\n* Visual score on the second-to-last grid row (row 62): it contains several 4-cell “slots”.\n  - Slots made of 3s represent UNFINISHED levels.\n  - When a slot changes from 3s to another color, that level is COMPLETE.\n* Track remaining MOVES/ENERGY by counting tiles with value 15.\n* Track LIVES by counting distinct 2×2 blocks of 8s.\n\n# GENERAL NOTES\n* The grid is a bird’s-eye view.\n* If the grid does not change after an action, you likely attempted an illegal move into 4s.\n* Favor routes marked by 3s; scan for 0/9 patches (generator) and confirm exit by nearby 5s; confirm the key by matching the bottom-left blueprint of 0s/9s.\n\n# EXAMPLE STRATEGY OBSERVATION\nThe 8×8 player (top rows 12s, bottom rows 9s) is flush against 4s on the left, so LEFT is blocked. I can see a 0/9 patch reachable via 3s to the right (likely the generator) and some 5s beyond it, so I should move RIGHT toward that corridor, cycling the key on the generator until the bottom-left key matches the one at the exit.\n\n# TURN:\nCall exactly one action.\n"

    "content": "\n# CONTEXT:\nYou are an agent playing a dynamic game. Your objective is to\nWIN and avoid GAME_OVER while minimizing actions.\n\nOne action produces one Frame. One Frame is made of one or more sequential\nGrids. Each Grid is a matrix size INT<0,63> by INT<0,63> filled with\nINT<0,15> values. Each value represents a different color and usually implies a different object.\n\nYou are playing a game called LockSmith.\n\n# CONTROLS\n* RESET: start over\n* ACTION1: move up\n* ACTION2: move down\n* ACTION3: move left\n* ACTION4: move right\n* ACTION5/ACTION6: no-ops\n\n# GOAL\nFind/generate a key that MATCHES the key pattern shown at the EXIT, then navigate to the EXIT to finish the level.\nThere are 6 levels total. Complete all levels to WIN.\n\n# TILE MEANINGS (important ones)\n* 0 = white cell (used in key patterns)\n* 3 = walkable path / corridor marker (often outlines routes to key/exit)\n* 4 = WALL (solid). You cannot enter 4s.\n* 5 = EXIT indicator (presence of 5s marks/frames the exit area)\n* 8 = LIFE token (count lives as the number of 2×2 blocks of 8s)\n* 9 = blue cells (used in player lower body; also appear elsewhere in the map and in key logic)\n* 12 = orange cells (used in player upper body)\n* 15 = MOVE counter (number of 15s ≈ moves/energy left)\n\n# PLAYER (sprite + movement legality)\n* The player is an 8×8 sprite made ONLY of 12s (top two rows) over 9s (bottom six rows).\n  - Concretely: rows 0–1 (relative to the sprite) are all 12s; rows 2–7 are all 9s.\n  - Other scattered 9s on the board are NOT the player—only the exact 8×8 (2×8 of 12s stacked on 6×8 of 9s) is the player.\n* Movement rules:\n  - You may move only through non-4 cells (i.e., never overlap a 4 after a move).\n  - If any part of your 8×8 sprite would overlap a 4 in the target direction (including cases where 4s lie “under” 9s), that move is ILLEGAL.\n  - If your sprite is already touching 4s on a side, you cannot move further in that touching direction until you have clearance.\n  - Practically: navigate corridors “between the 4s”.\n\n# KEYS, EXIT, AND HOW TO FIND THEM\n* The EXIT contains (or is adjacent to) the target key pattern and is marked by nearby 5s (it need not be fully surrounded; any 5s strongly indicate the exit region).\n* The bottom-left of the entire grid shows the REQUIRED KEY BLUEPRINT you must match: a specific layout of 0s (white) and 9s (blue).\n* Key generation mechanism (explicit):\n  - The KEY GENERATOR is a field/patch consisting of 0s and 9s that is NOT surrounded by 5s (i.e., not the exit).\n  - When any part of your 8×8 player walks onto this patch, a NEW candidate key is generated and displayed in the bottom-left.\n  - Step OFF the patch and then back ON to generate yet another candidate key; repeat to cycle through possibilities.\n  - You must keep cycling until the bottom-left candidate key EXACTLY matches the exit’s key (the same distribution of 0s and 9s seen within/adjacent to the 5s).\n* A reliable way to locate both the EXIT and the KEY GENERATOR area:\n  - Look for clusters of 0s and 9s reachable via 3s; if they are NOT framed by 5s, that area is most likely the generator. If you see 5s nearby framing a matching 0/9 pattern, that marks the exit.\n* When the pattern shown in the bottom-left matches the arrangement of 0s and 9s you see framed by (or adjacent to) 5s at the exit, move toward the 5s to complete the level.\n\n# HUD / PROGRESSION\n* Visual score on the second-to-last grid row (row 62): it contains several 4-cell “slots”.\n  - Slots made of 3s represent UNFINISHED levels.\n  - When a slot changes from 3s to another color, that level is COMPLETE.\n* Track remaining MOVES/ENERGY by counting tiles with value 15.\n* Track LIVES by counting distinct 2×2 blocks of 8s.\n\n# GENERAL NOTES\n* The grid is a bird’s-eye view.\n* If the grid does not change after an action, you likely attempted an illegal move into 4s.\n* Favor routes marked by 3s; scan for 0/9 patches (generator) and confirm exit by nearby 5s; confirm the key by matching the bottom-left blueprint of 0s/9s.\n\n# EXAMPLE STRATEGY OBSERVATION\nThe 8×8 player (top rows 12s, bottom rows 9s) is flush against 4s on the left, so LEFT is blocked. I can see a 0/9 patch reachable via 3s to the right (likely the generator) and some 5s beyond it, so I should move RIGHT toward that corridor, cycling the key on the generator until the bottom-left key matches the one at the exit.\n\n# TURN:\nCall exactly one action.\n"

    "role": "user",
    "content": "\n# CONTEXT:\nYou are an agent playing a dynamic game. Your objective is to\nWIN and avoid GAME_OVER while minimizing actions.\n\nOne action produces one Frame. One Frame is made of one or more sequential\nGrids. Each Grid is a matrix size INT<0,63> by INT<0,63> filled with\nINT<0,15> values. Each value represents a different color and usually implies a different object.\n\nYou are playing a game called LockSmith.\n\n# CONTROLS\n* RESET: start over\n* ACTION1: move up\n* ACTION2: move down\n* ACTION3: move left\n* ACTION4: move right\n* ACTION5/ACTION6: no-ops\n\n# GOAL\nFind/generate a key that MATCHES the key pattern shown at the EXIT, then navigate to the EXIT to finish the level.\nThere are 6 levels total. Complete all levels to WIN.\n\n# TILE MEANINGS (important ones)\n* 0 = white cell (used in key patterns)\n* 3 = walkable path / corridor marker (often outlines routes to key/exit)\n* 4 = WALL (solid). You cannot enter 4s.\n* 5 = EXIT indicator (presence of 5s marks/frames the exit area)\n* 8 = LIFE token (count lives as the number of 2×2 blocks of 8s)\n* 9 = blue cells (used in player lower body; also appear elsewhere in the map and in key logic)\n* 12 = orange cells (used in player upper body)\n* 15 = MOVE counter (number of 15s ≈ moves/energy left)\n\n# PLAYER (sprite + movement legality)\n* The player is an 8×8 sprite made ONLY of 12s (top two rows) over 9s (bottom six rows).\n  - Concretely: rows 0–1 (relative to the sprite) are all 12s; rows 2–7 are all 9s.\n  - Other scattered 9s on the board are NOT the player—only the exact 8×8 (2×8 of 12s stacked on 6×8 of 9s) is the player.\n* Movement rules:\n  - You may move only through non-4 cells (i.e., never overlap a 4 after a move).\n  - If any part of your 8×8 sprite would overlap a 4 in the target direction (including cases where 4s lie “under” 9s), that move is ILLEGAL.\n  - If your sprite is already touching 4s on a side, you cannot move further in that touching direction until you have clearance.\n  - Practically: navigate corridors “between the 4s”.\n\n# KEYS, EXIT, AND HOW TO FIND THEM\n* The EXIT contains (or is adjacent to) the target key pattern and is marked by nearby 5s (it need not be fully surrounded; any 5s strongly indicate the exit region).\n* The bottom-left of the entire grid shows the REQUIRED KEY BLUEPRINT you must match: a specific layout of 0s (white) and 9s (blue).\n* Key generation mechanism (explicit):\n  - The KEY GENERATOR is a field/patch consisting of 0s and 9s that is NOT surrounded by 5s (i.e., not the exit).\n  - When any part of your 8×8 player walks onto this patch, a NEW candidate key is generated and displayed in the bottom-left.\n  - Step OFF the patch and then back ON to generate yet another candidate key; repeat to cycle through possibilities.\n  - You must keep cycling until the bottom-left candidate key EXACTLY matches the exit’s key (the same distribution of 0s and 9s seen within/adjacent to the 5s).\n* A reliable way to locate both the EXIT and the KEY GENERATOR area:\n  - Look for clusters of 0s and 9s reachable via 3s; if they are NOT framed by 5s, that area is most likely the generator. If you see 5s nearby framing a matching 0/9 pattern, that marks the exit.\n* When the pattern shown in the bottom-left matches the arrangement of 0s and 9s you see framed by (or adjacent to) 5s at the exit, move toward the 5s to complete the level.\n\n# HUD / PROGRESSION\n* Visual score on the second-to-last grid row (row 62): it contains several 4-cell “slots”.\n  - Slots made of 3s represent UNFINISHED levels.\n  - When a slot changes from 3s to another color, that level is COMPLETE.\n* Track remaining MOVES/ENERGY by counting tiles with value 15.\n* Track LIVES by counting distinct 2×2 blocks of 8s.\n\n# GENERAL NOTES\n* The grid is a bird’s-eye view.\n* If the grid does not change after an action, you likely attempted an illegal move into 4s.\n* Favor routes marked by 3s; scan for 0/9 patches (generator) and confirm exit by nearby 5s; confirm the key by matching the bottom-left blueprint of 0s/9s.\n\n# EXAMPLE STRATEGY OBSERVATION\nThe 8×8 player (top rows 12s, bottom rows 9s) is flush against 4s on the left, so LEFT is blocked. I can see a 0/9 patch reachable via 3s to the right (likely the generator) and some 5s beyond it, so I should move RIGHT toward that corridor, cycling the key on the generator until the bottom-left key matches the one at the exit.\n\n# TURN:\nCall exactly one action.\n"

    "content": "\n# CONTEXT:\nYou are an agent playing a dynamic game. Your objective is to\nWIN and avoid GAME_OVER while minimizing actions.\n\nOne action produces one Frame. One Frame is made of one or more sequential\nGrids. Each Grid is a matrix size INT<0,63> by INT<0,63> filled with\nINT<0,15> values. Each value represents a different color and usually implies a different object.\n\nYou are playing a game called LockSmith.\n\n# CONTROLS\n* RESET: start over\n* ACTION1: move up\n* ACTION2: move down\n* ACTION3: move left\n* ACTION4: move right\n* ACTION5/ACTION6: no-ops\n\n# GOAL\nFind/generate a key that MATCHES the key pattern shown at the EXIT, then navigate to the EXIT to finish the level.\nThere are 6 levels total. Complete all levels to WIN.\n\n# TILE MEANINGS (important ones)\n* 0 = white cell (used in key patterns)\n* 3 = walkable path / corridor marker (often outlines routes to key/exit)\n* 4 = WALL (solid). You cannot enter 4s.\n* 5 = EXIT indicator (presence of 5s marks/frames the exit area)\n* 8 = LIFE token (count lives as the number of 2×2 blocks of 8s)\n* 9 = blue cells (used in player lower body; also appear elsewhere in the map and in key logic)\n* 12 = orange cells (used in player upper body)\n* 15 = MOVE counter (number of 15s ≈ moves/energy left)\n\n# PLAYER (sprite + movement legality)\n* The player is an 8×8 sprite made ONLY of 12s (top two rows) over 9s (bottom six rows).\n  - Concretely: rows 0–1 (relative to the sprite) are all 12s; rows 2–7 are all 9s.\n  - Other scattered 9s on the board are NOT the player—only the exact 8×8 (2×8 of 12s stacked on 6×8 of 9s) is the player.\n* Movement rules:\n  - You may move only through non-4 cells (i.e., never overlap a 4 after a move).\n  - If any part of your 8×8 sprite would overlap a 4 in the target direction (including cases where 4s lie “under” 9s), that move is ILLEGAL.\n  - If your sprite is already touching 4s on a side, you cannot move further in that touching direction until you have clearance.\n  - Practically: navigate corridors “between the 4s”.\n\n# KEYS, EXIT, AND HOW TO FIND THEM\n* The EXIT contains (or is adjacent to) the target key pattern and is marked by nearby 5s (it need not be fully surrounded; any 5s strongly indicate the exit region).\n* The bottom-left of the entire grid shows the REQUIRED KEY BLUEPRINT you must match: a specific layout of 0s (white) and 9s (blue).\n* Key generation mechanism (explicit):\n  - The KEY GENERATOR is a field/patch consisting of 0s and 9s that is NOT surrounded by 5s (i.e., not the exit).\n  - When any part of your 8×8 player walks onto this patch, a NEW candidate key is generated and displayed in the bottom-left.\n  - Step OFF the patch and then back ON to generate yet another candidate key; repeat to cycle through possibilities.\n  - You must keep cycling until the bottom-left candidate key EXACTLY matches the exit’s key (the same distribution of 0s and 9s seen within/adjacent to the 5s).\n* A reliable way to locate both the EXIT and the KEY GENERATOR area:\n  - Look for clusters of 0s and 9s reachable via 3s; if they are NOT framed by 5s, that area is most likely the generator. If you see 5s nearby framing a matching 0/9 pattern, that marks the exit.\n* When the pattern shown in the bottom-left matches the arrangement of 0s and 9s you see framed by (or adjacent to) 5s at the exit, move toward the 5s to complete the level.\n\n# HUD / PROGRESSION\n* Visual score on the second-to-last grid row (row 62): it contains several 4-cell “slots”.\n  - Slots made of 3s represent UNFINISHED levels.\n  - When a slot changes from 3s to another color, that level is COMPLETE.\n* Track remaining MOVES/ENERGY by counting tiles with value 15.\n* Track LIVES by counting distinct 2×2 blocks of 8s.\n\n# GENERAL NOTES\n* The grid is a bird’s-eye view.\n* If the grid does not change after an action, you likely attempted an illegal move into 4s.\n* Favor routes marked by 3s; scan for 0/9 patches (generator) and confirm exit by nearby 5s; confirm the key by matching the bottom-left blueprint of 0s/9s.\n\n# EXAMPLE STRATEGY OBSERVATION\nThe 8×8 player (top rows 12s, bottom rows 9s) is flush against 4s on the left, so LEFT is blocked. I can see a 0/9 patch reachable via 3s to the right (likely the generator) and some 5s beyond it, so I should move RIGHT toward that corridor, cycling the key on the generator until the bottom-left key matches the one at the exit.\n\n# TURN:\nCall exactly one action.\n"

    "content": "\n# CONTEXT:\nYou are an agent playing a dynamic game. Your objective is to\nWIN and avoid GAME_OVER while minimizing actions.\n\nOne action produces one Frame. One Frame is made of one or more sequential\nGrids. Each Grid is a matrix size INT<0,63> by INT<0,63> filled with\nINT<0,15> values. Each value represents a different color and usually implies a different object.\n\nYou are playing a game called LockSmith.\n\n# CONTROLS\n* RESET: start over\n* ACTION1: move up\n* ACTION2: move down\n* ACTION3: move left\n* ACTION4: move right\n* ACTION5/ACTION6: no-ops\n\n# GOAL\nFind/generate a key that MATCHES the key pattern shown at the EXIT, then navigate to the EXIT to finish the level.\nThere are 6 levels total. Complete all levels to WIN.\n\n# TILE MEANINGS (important ones)\n* 0 = white cell (used in key patterns)\n* 3 = walkable path / corridor marker (often outlines routes to key/exit)\n* 4 = WALL (solid). You cannot enter 4s.\n* 5 = EXIT indicator (presence of 5s marks/frames the exit area)\n* 8 = LIFE token (count lives as the number of 2×2 blocks of 8s)\n* 9 = blue cells (used in player lower body; also appear elsewhere in the map and in key logic)\n* 12 = orange cells (used in player upper body)\n* 15 = MOVE counter (number of 15s ≈ moves/energy left)\n\n# PLAYER (sprite + movement legality)\n* The player is an 8×8 sprite made ONLY of 12s (top two rows) over 9s (bottom six rows).\n  - Concretely: rows 0–1 (relative to the sprite) are all 12s; rows 2–7 are all 9s.\n  - Other scattered 9s on the board are NOT the player—only the exact 8×8 (2×8 of 12s stacked on 6×8 of 9s) is the player.\n* Movement rules:\n  - You may move only through non-4 cells (i.e., never overlap a 4 after a move).\n  - If any part of your 8×8 sprite would overlap a 4 in the target direction (including cases where 4s lie “under” 9s), that move is ILLEGAL.\n  - If your sprite is already touching 4s on a side, you cannot move further in that touching direction until you have clearance.\n  - Practically: navigate corridors “between the 4s”.\n\n# KEYS, EXIT, AND HOW TO FIND THEM\n* The EXIT contains (or is adjacent to) the target key pattern and is marked by nearby 5s (it need not be fully surrounded; any 5s strongly indicate the exit region).\n* The bottom-left of the entire grid shows the REQUIRED KEY BLUEPRINT you must match: a specific layout of 0s (white) and 9s (blue).\n* Key generation mechanism (explicit):\n  - The KEY GENERATOR is a field/patch consisting of 0s and 9s that is NOT surrounded by 5s (i.e., not the exit).\n  - When any part of your 8×8 player walks onto this patch, a NEW candidate key is generated and displayed in the bottom-left.\n  - Step OFF the patch and then back ON to generate yet another candidate key; repeat to cycle through possibilities.\n  - You must keep cycling until the bottom-left candidate key EXACTLY matches the exit’s key (the same distribution of 0s and 9s seen within/adjacent to the 5s).\n* A reliable way to locate both the EXIT and the KEY GENERATOR area:\n  - Look for clusters of 0s and 9s reachable via 3s; if they are NOT framed by 5s, that area is most likely the generator. If you see 5s nearby framing a matching 0/9 pattern, that marks the exit.\n* When the pattern shown in the bottom-left matches the arrangement of 0s and 9s you see framed by (or adjacent to) 5s at the exit, move toward the 5s to complete the level.\n\n# HUD / PROGRESSION\n* Visual score on the second-to-last grid row (row 62): it contains several 4-cell “slots”.\n  - Slots made of 3s represent UNFINISHED levels.\n  - When a slot changes from 3s to another color, that level is COMPLETE.\n* Track remaining MOVES/ENERGY by counting tiles with value 15.\n* Track LIVES by counting distinct 2×2 blocks of 8s.\n\n# GENERAL NOTES\n* The grid is a bird’s-eye view.\n* If the grid does not change after an action, you likely attempted an illegal move into 4s.\n* Favor routes marked by 3s; scan for 0/9 patches (generator) and confirm exit by nearby 5s; confirm the key by matching the bottom-left blueprint of 0s/9s.\n\n# EXAMPLE STRATEGY OBSERVATION\nThe 8×8 player (top rows 12s, bottom rows 9s) is flush against 4s on the left, so LEFT is blocked. I can see a 0/9 patch reachable via 3s to the right (likely the generator) and some 5s beyond it, so I should move RIGHT toward that corridor, cycling the key on the generator until the bottom-left key matches the one at the exit.\n\n# TURN:\nCall exactly one action.\n"

One Frame is made of one or more sequential\nGrids. Each Grid is a matrix size INT<0,63> by INT<0,63> filled with\nINT<0,15> values. Each value represents a different color and usually implies a different object.\n\nYou are playing a game called LockSmith.\n\n# CONTROLS\n* RESET: start over\n* ACTION1: move up\n* ACTION2: move down\n* ACTION3: move left\n* ACTION4: move right\n* ACTION5/ACTION6: no-ops\n\n# GOAL\nFind/generate a key that MATCHES the key pattern shown at the EXIT, then navigate to the EXIT to finish the level.\nThere are 6 levels total. Complete all levels to WIN.\n\n# TILE MEANINGS (important ones)\n* 0 = white cell (used in key patterns)\n* 3 = walkable path / corridor marker (often outlines routes to key/exit)\n* 4 = WALL (solid). You cannot enter 4s.\n* 5 = EXIT indicator (presence of 5s marks/frames the exit area)\n* 8 = LIFE token (count lives as the number of 2×2 blocks of 8s)\n* 9 = blue cells (used in player lower body; also appear elsewhere in the map and in key logic)\n* 12 = orange cells (used in player upper body)\n* 15 = MOVE counter (number of 15s ≈ moves/energy left)\n\n# PLAYER (sprite + movement legality)\n* The player is an 8×8 sprite made ONLY of 12s (top two rows) over 9s (bottom six rows).\n  - Concretely: rows 0–1 (relative to the sprite) are all 12s; rows 2–7 are all 9s.\n  - Other scattered 9s on the board are NOT the player—only the exact 8×8 (2×8 of 12s stacked on 6×8 of 9s) is the player.\n* Movement rules:\n  - You may move only through non-4 cells (i.e., never overlap a 4 after a move).\n  - If any part of your 8×8 sprite would overlap a 4 in the target direction (including cases where 4s lie “under” 9s), that move is ILLEGAL.\n  - If your sprite is already touching 4s on a side, you cannot move further in that touching direction until you have clearance.\n  - Practically: navigate corridors “between the 4s”.\n\n# KEYS, EXIT, AND HOW TO FIND THEM\n* The EXIT contains (or is adjacent to) the target key pattern and is marked by nearby 5s (it need not be fully surrounded; any 5s strongly indicate the exit region).\n* The bottom-left of the entire grid shows the REQUIRED KEY BLUEPRINT you must match: a specific layout of 0s (white) and 9s (blue).\n* Key generation mechanism (explicit):\n  - The KEY GENERATOR is a field/patch consisting of 0s and 9s that is NOT surrounded by 5s (i.e., not the exit).\n  - When any part of your 8×8 player walks onto this patch, a NEW candidate key is generated and displayed in the bottom-left.\n  - Step OFF the patch and then back ON to generate yet another candidate key; repeat to cycle through possibilities.\n  - You must keep cycling until the bottom-left candidate key EXACTLY matches the exit’s key (the same distribution of 0s and 9s seen within/adjacent to the 5s).\n* A reliable way to locate both the EXIT and the KEY GENERATOR area:\n  - Look for clusters of 0s and 9s reachable via 3s; if they are NOT framed by 5s, that area is most likely the generator. If you see 5s nearby framing a matching 0/9 pattern, that marks the exit.\n* When the pattern shown in the bottom-left matches the arrangement of 0s and 9s you see framed by (or adjacent to) 5s at the exit, move toward the 5s to complete the level.\n\n# HUD / PROGRESSION\n* Visual score on the second-to-last grid row (row 62): it contains several 4-cell “slots”.\n  - Slots made of 3s represent UNFINISHED levels.\n  - When a slot changes from 3s to another color, that level is COMPLETE.\n* Track remaining MOVES/ENERGY by counting tiles with value 15.\n* Track LIVES by counting distinct 2×2 blocks of 8s.\n\n# GENERAL NOTES\n* The grid is a bird’s-eye view.\n* If the grid does not change after an action, you likely attempted an illegal move into 4s.\n* Favor routes marked by 3s; scan for 0/9 patches (generator) and confirm exit by nearby 5s; confirm the key by matching the bottom-left blueprint of 0s/9s.\n\n# EXAMPLE STRATEGY OBSERVATION\nThe 8×8 player (top rows 12s, bottom rows 9s) is flush against 4s on the left, so LEFT is blocked. I can see a 0/9 patch reachable via 3s to the right (likely the generator) and some 5s beyond it, so I should move RIGHT toward that corridor, cycling the key on the generator until the bottom-left key matches the one at the exit.\n\n# TURN:\nCall exactly one action.\n"

Each value represents a different color and usually implies a different object.\n\nYou are playing a game called LockSmith.\n\n# CONTROLS\n* RESET: start over\n* ACTION1: move up\n* ACTION2: move down\n* ACTION3: move left\n* ACTION4: move right\n* ACTION5/ACTION6: no-ops\n\n# GOAL\nFind/generate a key that MATCHES the key pattern shown at the EXIT, then navigate to the EXIT to finish the level.\nThere are 6 levels total. Complete all levels to WIN.\n\n# TILE MEANINGS (important ones)\n* 0 = white cell (used in key patterns)\n* 3 = walkable path / corridor marker (often outlines routes to key/exit)\n* 4 = WALL (solid). You cannot enter 4s.\n* 5 = EXIT indicator (presence of 5s marks/frames the exit area)\n* 8 = LIFE token (count lives as the number of 2×2 blocks of 8s)\n* 9 = blue cells (used in player lower body; also appear elsewhere in the map and in key logic)\n* 12 = orange cells (used in player upper body)\n* 15 = MOVE counter (number of 15s ≈ moves/energy left)\n\n# PLAYER (sprite + movement legality)\n* The player is an 8×8 sprite made ONLY of 12s (top two rows) over 9s (bottom six rows).\n  - Concretely: rows 0–1 (relative to the sprite) are all 12s; rows 2–7 are all 9s.\n  - Other scattered 9s on the board are NOT the player—only the exact 8×8 (2×8 of 12s stacked on 6×8 of 9s) is the player.\n* Movement rules:\n  - You may move only through non-4 cells (i.e., never overlap a 4 after a move).\n  - If any part of your 8×8 sprite would overlap a 4 in the target direction (including cases where 4s lie “under” 9s), that move is ILLEGAL.\n  - If your sprite is already touching 4s on a side, you cannot move further in that touching direction until you have clearance.\n  - Practically: navigate corridors “between the 4s”.\n\n# KEYS, EXIT, AND HOW TO FIND THEM\n* The EXIT contains (or is adjacent to) the target key pattern and is marked by nearby 5s (it need not be fully surrounded; any 5s strongly indicate the exit region).\n* The bottom-left of the entire grid shows the REQUIRED KEY BLUEPRINT you must match: a specific layout of 0s (white) and 9s (blue).\n* Key generation mechanism (explicit):\n  - The KEY GENERATOR is a field/patch consisting of 0s and 9s that is NOT surrounded by 5s (i.e., not the exit).\n  - When any part of your 8×8 player walks onto this patch, a NEW candidate key is generated and displayed in the bottom-left.\n  - Step OFF the patch and then back ON to generate yet another candidate key; repeat to cycle through possibilities.\n  - You must keep cycling until the bottom-left candidate key EXACTLY matches the exit’s key (the same distribution of 0s and 9s seen within/adjacent to the 5s).\n* A reliable way to locate both the EXIT and the KEY GENERATOR area:\n  - Look for clusters of 0s and 9s reachable via 3s; if they are NOT framed by 5s, that area is most likely the generator. If you see 5s nearby framing a matching 0/9 pattern, that marks the exit.\n* When the pattern shown in the bottom-left matches the arrangement of 0s and 9s you see framed by (or adjacent to) 5s at the exit, move toward the 5s to complete the level.\n\n# HUD / PROGRESSION\n* Visual score on the second-to-last grid row (row 62): it contains several 4-cell “slots”.\n  - Slots made of 3s represent UNFINISHED levels.\n  - When a slot changes from 3s to another color, that level is COMPLETE.\n* Track remaining MOVES/ENERGY by counting tiles with value 15.\n* Track LIVES by counting distinct 2×2 blocks of 8s.\n\n# GENERAL NOTES\n* The grid is a bird’s-eye view.\n* If the grid does not change after an action, you likely attempted an illegal move into 4s.\n* Favor routes marked by 3s; scan for 0/9 patches (generator) and confirm exit by nearby 5s; confirm the key by matching the bottom-left blueprint of 0s/9s.\n\n# EXAMPLE STRATEGY OBSERVATION\nThe 8×8 player (top rows 12s, bottom rows 9s) is flush against 4s on the left, so LEFT is blocked. I can see a 0/9 patch reachable via 3s to the right (likely the generator) and some 5s beyond it, so I should move RIGHT toward that corridor, cycling the key on the generator until the bottom-left key matches the one at the exit.\n\n# TURN:\nCall exactly one action.\n"

    "content": "\n# CONTEXT:\nYou are an agent playing a dynamic game. Your objective is to\nWIN and avoid GAME_OVER while minimizing actions.\n\nOne action produces one Frame. One Frame is made of one or more sequential\nGrids. Each Grid is a matrix size INT<0,63> by INT<0,63> filled with\nINT<0,15> values. Each value represents a different color and usually implies a different object.\n\nYou are playing a game called LockSmith.\n\n# CONTROLS\n* RESET: start over\n* ACTION1: move up\n* ACTION2: move down\n* ACTION3: move left\n* ACTION4: move right\n* ACTION5/ACTION6: no-ops\n\n# GOAL\nFind/generate a key that MATCHES the key pattern shown at the EXIT, then navigate to the EXIT to finish the level.\nThere are 6 levels total. Complete all levels to WIN.\n\n# TILE MEANINGS (important ones)\n* 0 = white cell (used in key patterns)\n* 3 = walkable path / corridor marker (often outlines routes to key/exit)\n* 4 = WALL (solid). You cannot enter 4s.\n* 5 = EXIT indicator (presence of 5s marks/frames the exit area)\n* 8 = LIFE token (count lives as the number of 2×2 blocks of 8s)\n* 9 = blue cells (used in player lower body; also appear elsewhere in the map and in key logic)\n* 12 = orange cells (used in player upper body)\n* 15 = MOVE counter (number of 15s ≈ moves/energy left)\n\n# PLAYER (sprite + movement legality)\n* The player is an 8×8 sprite made ONLY of 12s (top two rows) over 9s (bottom six rows).\n  - Concretely: rows 0–1 (relative to the sprite) are all 12s; rows 2–7 are all 9s.\n  - Other scattered 9s on the board are NOT the player—only the exact 8×8 (2×8 of 12s stacked on 6×8 of 9s) is the player.\n* Movement rules:\n  - You may move only through non-4 cells (i.e., never overlap a 4 after a move).\n  - If any part of your 8×8 sprite would overlap a 4 in the target direction (including cases where 4s lie “under” 9s), that move is ILLEGAL.\n  - If your sprite is already touching 4s on a side, you cannot move further in that touching direction until you have clearance.\n  - Practically: navigate corridors “between the 4s”.\n\n# KEYS, EXIT, AND HOW TO FIND THEM\n* The EXIT contains (or is adjacent to) the target key pattern and is marked by nearby 5s (it need not be fully surrounded; any 5s strongly indicate the exit region).\n* The bottom-left of the entire grid shows the REQUIRED KEY BLUEPRINT you must match: a specific layout of 0s (white) and 9s (blue).\n* Key generation mechanism (explicit):\n  - The KEY GENERATOR is a field/patch consisting of 0s and 9s that is NOT surrounded by 5s (i.e., not the exit).\n  - When any part of your 8×8 player walks onto this patch, a NEW candidate key is generated and displayed in the bottom-left.\n  - Step OFF the patch and then back ON to generate yet another candidate key; repeat to cycle through possibilities.\n  - You must keep cycling until the bottom-left candidate key EXACTLY matches the exit’s key (the same distribution of 0s and 9s seen within/adjacent to the 5s).\n* A reliable way to locate both the EXIT and the KEY GENERATOR area:\n  - Look for clusters of 0s and 9s reachable via 3s; if they are NOT framed by 5s, that area is most likely the generator. If you see 5s nearby framing a matching 0/9 pattern, that marks the exit.\n* When the pattern shown in the bottom-left matches the arrangement of 0s and 9s you see framed by (or adjacent to) 5s at the exit, move toward the 5s to complete the level.\n\n# HUD / PROGRESSION\n* Visual score on the second-to-last grid row (row 62): it contains several 4-cell “slots”.\n  - Slots made of 3s represent UNFINISHED levels.\n  - When a slot changes from 3s to another color, that level is COMPLETE.\n* Track remaining MOVES/ENERGY by counting tiles with value 15.\n* Track LIVES by counting distinct 2×2 blocks of 8s.\n\n# GENERAL NOTES\n* The grid is a bird’s-eye view.\n* If the grid does not change after an action, you likely attempted an illegal move into 4s.\n* Favor routes marked by 3s; scan for 0/9 patches (generator) and confirm exit by nearby 5s; confirm the key by matching the bottom-left blueprint of 0s/9s.\n\n# EXAMPLE STRATEGY OBSERVATION\nThe 8×8 player (top rows 12s, bottom rows 9s) is flush against 4s on the left, so LEFT is blocked. I can see a 0/9 patch reachable via 3s to the right (likely the generator) and some 5s beyond it, so I should move RIGHT toward that corridor, cycling the key on the generator until the bottom-left key matches the one at the exit.\n\n# TURN:\nCall exactly one action.\n"

    "content": "\n# CONTEXT:\nYou are an agent playing a dynamic game. Your objective is to\nWIN and avoid GAME_OVER while minimizing actions.\n\nOne action produces one Frame. One Frame is made of one or more sequential\nGrids. Each Grid is a matrix size INT<0,63> by INT<0,63> filled with\nINT<0,15> values. Each value represents a different color and usually implies a different object.\n\nYou are playing a game called LockSmith.\n\n# CONTROLS\n* RESET: start over\n* ACTION1: move up\n* ACTION2: move down\n* ACTION3: move left\n* ACTION4: move right\n* ACTION5/ACTION6: no-ops\n\n# GOAL\nFind/generate a key that MATCHES the key pattern shown at the EXIT, then navigate to the EXIT to finish the level.\nThere are 6 levels total. Complete all levels to WIN.\n\n# TILE MEANINGS (important ones)\n* 0 = white cell (used in key patterns)\n* 3 = walkable path / corridor marker (often outlines routes to key/exit)\n* 4 = WALL (solid). You cannot enter 4s.\n* 5 = EXIT indicator (presence of 5s marks/frames the exit area)\n* 8 = LIFE token (count lives as the number of 2×2 blocks of 8s)\n* 9 = blue cells (used in player lower body; also appear elsewhere in the map and in key logic)\n* 12 = orange cells (used in player upper body)\n* 15 = MOVE counter (number of 15s ≈ moves/energy left)\n\n# PLAYER (sprite + movement legality)\n* The player is an 8×8 sprite made ONLY of 12s (top two rows) over 9s (bottom six rows).\n  - Concretely: rows 0–1 (relative to the sprite) are all 12s; rows 2–7 are all 9s.\n  - Other scattered 9s on the board are NOT the player—only the exact 8×8 (2×8 of 12s stacked on 6×8 of 9s) is the player.\n* Movement rules:\n  - You may move only through non-4 cells (i.e., never overlap a 4 after a move).\n  - If any part of your 8×8 sprite would overlap a 4 in the target direction (including cases where 4s lie “under” 9s), that move is ILLEGAL.\n  - If your sprite is already touching 4s on a side, you cannot move further in that touching direction until you have clearance.\n  - Practically: navigate corridors “between the 4s”.\n\n# KEYS, EXIT, AND HOW TO FIND THEM\n* The EXIT contains (or is adjacent to) the target key pattern and is marked by nearby 5s (it need not be fully surrounded; any 5s strongly indicate the exit region).\n* The bottom-left of the entire grid shows the REQUIRED KEY BLUEPRINT you must match: a specific layout of 0s (white) and 9s (blue).\n* Key generation mechanism (explicit):\n  - The KEY GENERATOR is a field/patch consisting of 0s and 9s that is NOT surrounded by 5s (i.e., not the exit).\n  - When any part of your 8×8 player walks onto this patch, a NEW candidate key is generated and displayed in the bottom-left.\n  - Step OFF the patch and then back ON to generate yet another candidate key; repeat to cycle through possibilities.\n  - You must keep cycling until the bottom-left candidate key EXACTLY matches the exit’s key (the same distribution of 0s and 9s seen within/adjacent to the 5s).\n* A reliable way to locate both the EXIT and the KEY GENERATOR area:\n  - Look for clusters of 0s and 9s reachable via 3s; if they are NOT framed by 5s, that area is most likely the generator. If you see 5s nearby framing a matching 0/9 pattern, that marks the exit.\n* When the pattern shown in the bottom-left matches the arrangement of 0s and 9s you see framed by (or adjacent to) 5s at the exit, move toward the 5s to complete the level.\n\n# HUD / PROGRESSION\n* Visual score on the second-to-last grid row (row 62): it contains several 4-cell “slots”.\n  - Slots made of 3s represent UNFINISHED levels.\n  - When a slot changes from 3s to another color, that level is COMPLETE.\n* Track remaining MOVES/ENERGY by counting tiles with value 15.\n* Track LIVES by counting distinct 2×2 blocks of 8s.\n\n# GENERAL NOTES\n* The grid is a bird’s-eye view.\n* If the grid does not change after an action, you likely attempted an illegal move into 4s.\n* Favor routes marked by 3s; scan for 0/9 patches (generator) and confirm exit by nearby 5s; confirm the key by matching the bottom-left blueprint of 0s/9s.\n\n# EXAMPLE STRATEGY OBSERVATION\nThe 8×8 player (top rows 12s, bottom rows 9s) is flush against 4s on the left, so LEFT is blocked. I can see a 0/9 patch reachable via 3s to the right (likely the generator) and some 5s beyond it, so I should move RIGHT toward that corridor, cycling the key on the generator until the bottom-left key matches the one at the exit.\n\n# TURN:\nCall exactly one action.\n"

Large clusters of 0/9 near the bottom-left region hint at a candidate generator patch, which is how you cycle keys.\n- There are visible 5s marking an exit region but not fully enclosed, so the exit area is likely just beyond a corridor.\n- The actual player sprite (12s over 9s) appears near the lower portion of the frame, with a clear route to a 0/9 patch if you follow available 3s corridors.\n- Plan: move along the reachable 3s toward the bottom-left generator patch, step onto it to generate a candidate key, then step off and back onto it to cycle through keys until the bottom-left key matches the exit’s 0/9 pattern. Once matched, head toward the nearby 5s to finish."

    "content": "\n# CONTEXT:\nYou are an agent playing a dynamic game. Your objective is to\nWIN and avoid GAME_OVER while minimizing actions.\n\nOne action produces one Frame. One Frame is made of one or more sequential\nGrids. Each Grid is a matrix size INT<0,63> by INT<0,63> filled with\nINT<0,15> values. Each value represents a different color and usually implies a different object.\n\nYou are playing a game called LockSmith.\n\n# CONTROLS\n* RESET: start over\n* ACTION1: move up\n* ACTION2: move down\n* ACTION3: move left\n* ACTION4: move right\n* ACTION5/ACTION6: no-ops\n\n# GOAL\nFind/generate a key that MATCHES the key pattern shown at the EXIT, then navigate to the EXIT to finish the level.\nThere are 6 levels total. Complete all levels to WIN.\n\n# TILE MEANINGS (important ones)\n* 0 = white cell (used in key patterns)\n* 3 = walkable path / corridor marker (often outlines routes to key/exit)\n* 4 = WALL (solid). You cannot enter 4s.\n* 5 = EXIT indicator (presence of 5s marks/frames the exit area)\n* 8 = LIFE token (count lives as the number of 2×2 blocks of 8s)\n* 9 = blue cells (used in player lower body; also appear elsewhere in the map and in key logic)\n* 12 = orange cells (used in player upper body)\n* 15 = MOVE counter (number of 15s ≈ moves/energy left)\n\n# PLAYER (sprite + movement legality)\n* The player is an 8×8 sprite made ONLY of 12s (top two rows) over 9s (bottom six rows).\n  - Concretely: rows 0–1 (relative to the sprite) are all 12s; rows 2–7 are all 9s.\n  - Other scattered 9s on the board are NOT the player—only the exact 8×8 (2×8 of 12s stacked on 6×8 of 9s) is the player.\n* Movement rules:\n  - You may move only through non-4 cells (i.e., never overlap a 4 after a move).\n  - If any part of your 8×8 sprite would overlap a 4 in the target direction (including cases where 4s lie “under” 9s), that move is ILLEGAL.\n  - If your sprite is already touching 4s on a side, you cannot move further in that touching direction until you have clearance.\n  - Practically: navigate corridors “between the 4s”.\n\n# KEYS, EXIT, AND HOW TO FIND THEM\n* The EXIT contains (or is adjacent to) the target key pattern and is marked by nearby 5s (it need not be fully surrounded; any 5s strongly indicate the exit region).\n* The bottom-left of the entire grid shows the REQUIRED KEY BLUEPRINT you must match: a specific layout of 0s (white) and 9s (blue).\n* Key generation mechanism (explicit):\n  - The KEY GENERATOR is a field/patch consisting of 0s and 9s that is NOT surrounded by 5s (i.e., not the exit).\n  - When any part of your 8×8 player walks onto this patch, a NEW candidate key is generated and displayed in the bottom-left.\n  - Step OFF the patch and then back ON to generate yet another candidate key; repeat to cycle through possibilities.\n  - You must keep cycling until the bottom-left candidate key EXACTLY matches the exit’s key (the same distribution of 0s and 9s seen within/adjacent to the 5s).\n* A reliable way to locate both the EXIT and the KEY GENERATOR area:\n  - Look for clusters of 0s and 9s reachable via 3s; if they are NOT framed by 5s, that area is most likely the generator. If you see 5s nearby framing a matching 0/9 pattern, that marks the exit.\n* When the pattern shown in the bottom-left matches the arrangement of 0s and 9s you see framed by (or adjacent to) 5s at the exit, move toward the 5s to complete the level.\n\n# HUD / PROGRESSION\n* Visual score on the second-to-last grid row (row 62): it contains several 4-cell “slots”.\n  - Slots made of 3s represent UNFINISHED levels.\n  - When a slot changes from 3s to another color, that level is COMPLETE.\n* Track remaining MOVES/ENERGY by counting tiles with value 15.\n* Track LIVES by counting distinct 2×2 blocks of 8s.\n\n# GENERAL NOTES\n* The grid is a bird’s-eye view.\n* If the grid does not change after an action, you likely attempted an illegal move into 4s.\n* Favor routes marked by 3s; scan for 0/9 patches (generator) and confirm exit by nearby 5s; confirm the key by matching the bottom-left blueprint of 0s/9s.\n\n# EXAMPLE STRATEGY OBSERVATION\nThe 8×8 player (top rows 12s, bottom rows 9s) is flush against 4s on the left, so LEFT is blocked. I can see a 0/9 patch reachable via 3s to the right (likely the generator) and some 5s beyond it, so I should move RIGHT toward that corridor, cycling the key on the generator until the bottom-left key matches the one at the exit.\n\n# TURN:\nCall exactly one action.\n"

    "content": "\n# CONTEXT:\nYou are an agent playing a dynamic game. Your objective is to\nWIN and avoid GAME_OVER while minimizing actions.\n\nOne action produces one Frame. One Frame is made of one or more sequential\nGrids. Each Grid is a matrix size INT<0,63> by INT<0,63> filled with\nINT<0,15> values. Each value represents a different color and usually implies a different object.\n\nYou are playing a game called LockSmith.\n\n# CONTROLS\n* RESET: start over\n* ACTION1: move up\n* ACTION2: move down\n* ACTION3: move left\n* ACTION4: move right\n* ACTION5/ACTION6: no-ops\n\n# GOAL\nFind/generate a key that MATCHES the key pattern shown at the EXIT, then navigate to the EXIT to finish the level.\nThere are 6 levels total. Complete all levels to WIN.\n\n# TILE MEANINGS (important ones)\n* 0 = white cell (used in key patterns)\n* 3 = walkable path / corridor marker (often outlines routes to key/exit)\n* 4 = WALL (solid). You cannot enter 4s.\n* 5 = EXIT indicator (presence of 5s marks/frames the exit area)\n* 8 = LIFE token (count lives as the number of 2×2 blocks of 8s)\n* 9 = blue cells (used in player lower body; also appear elsewhere in the map and in key logic)\n* 12 = orange cells (used in player upper body)\n* 15 = MOVE counter (number of 15s ≈ moves/energy left)\n\n# PLAYER (sprite + movement legality)\n* The player is an 8×8 sprite made ONLY of 12s (top two rows) over 9s (bottom six rows).\n  - Concretely: rows 0–1 (relative to the sprite) are all 12s; rows 2–7 are all 9s.\n  - Other scattered 9s on the board are NOT the player—only the exact 8×8 (2×8 of 12s stacked on 6×8 of 9s) is the player.\n* Movement rules:\n  - You may move only through non-4 cells (i.e., never overlap a 4 after a move).\n  - If any part of your 8×8 sprite would overlap a 4 in the target direction (including cases where 4s lie “under” 9s), that move is ILLEGAL.\n  - If your sprite is already touching 4s on a side, you cannot move further in that touching direction until you have clearance.\n  - Practically: navigate corridors “between the 4s”.\n\n# KEYS, EXIT, AND HOW TO FIND THEM\n* The EXIT contains (or is adjacent to) the target key pattern and is marked by nearby 5s (it need not be fully surrounded; any 5s strongly indicate the exit region).\n* The bottom-left of the entire grid shows the REQUIRED KEY BLUEPRINT you must match: a specific layout of 0s (white) and 9s (blue).\n* Key generation mechanism (explicit):\n  - The KEY GENERATOR is a field/patch consisting of 0s and 9s that is NOT surrounded by 5s (i.e., not the exit).\n  - When any part of your 8×8 player walks onto this patch, a NEW candidate key is generated and displayed in the bottom-left.\n  - Step OFF the patch and then back ON to generate yet another candidate key; repeat to cycle through possibilities.\n  - You must keep cycling until the bottom-left candidate key EXACTLY matches the exit’s key (the same distribution of 0s and 9s seen within/adjacent to the 5s).\n* A reliable way to locate both the EXIT and the KEY GENERATOR area:\n  - Look for clusters of 0s and 9s reachable via 3s; if they are NOT framed by 5s, that area is most likely the generator. If you see 5s nearby framing a matching 0/9 pattern, that marks the exit.\n* When the pattern shown in the bottom-left matches the arrangement of 0s and 9s you see framed by (or adjacent to) 5s at the exit, move toward the 5s to complete the level.\n\n# HUD / PROGRESSION\n* Visual score on the second-to-last grid row (row 62): it contains several 4-cell “slots”.\n  - Slots made of 3s represent UNFINISHED levels.\n  - When a slot changes from 3s to another color, that level is COMPLETE.\n* Track remaining MOVES/ENERGY by counting tiles with value 15.\n* Track LIVES by counting distinct 2×2 blocks of 8s.\n\n# GENERAL NOTES\n* The grid is a bird’s-eye view.\n* If the grid does not change after an action, you likely attempted an illegal move into 4s.\n* Favor routes marked by 3s; scan for 0/9 patches (generator) and confirm exit by nearby 5s; confirm the key by matching the bottom-left blueprint of 0s/9s.\n\n# EXAMPLE STRATEGY OBSERVATION\nThe 8×8 player (top rows 12s, bottom rows 9s) is flush against 4s on the left, so LEFT is blocked. I can see a 0/9 patch reachable via 3s to the right (likely the generator) and some 5s beyond it, so I should move RIGHT toward that corridor, cycling the key on the generator until the bottom-left key matches the one at the exit.\n\n# TURN:\nCall exactly one action.\n"

One Frame is made of one or more sequential\nGrids. Each Grid is a matrix size INT<0,63> by INT<0,63> filled with\nINT<0,15> values. Each value represents a different color and usually implies a different object.\n\nYou are playing a game called LockSmith.\n\n# CONTROLS\n* RESET: start over\n* ACTION1: move up\n* ACTION2: move down\n* ACTION3: move left\n* ACTION4: move right\n* ACTION5/ACTION6: no-ops\n\n# GOAL\nFind/generate a key that MATCHES the key pattern shown at the EXIT, then navigate to the EXIT to finish the level.\nThere are 6 levels total. Complete all levels to WIN.\n\n# TILE MEANINGS (important ones)\n* 0 = white cell (used in key patterns)\n* 3 = walkable path / corridor marker (often outlines routes to key/exit)\n* 4 = WALL (solid). You cannot enter 4s.\n* 5 = EXIT indicator (presence of 5s marks/frames the exit area)\n* 8 = LIFE token (count lives as the number of 2×2 blocks of 8s)\n* 9 = blue cells (used in player lower body; also appear elsewhere in the map and in key logic)\n* 12 = orange cells (used in player upper body)\n* 15 = MOVE counter (number of 15s ≈ moves/energy left)\n\n# PLAYER (sprite + movement legality)\n* The player is an 8×8 sprite made ONLY of 12s (top two rows) over 9s (bottom six rows).\n  - Concretely: rows 0–1 (relative to the sprite) are all 12s; rows 2–7 are all 9s.\n  - Other scattered 9s on the board are NOT the player—only the exact 8×8 (2×8 of 12s stacked on 6×8 of 9s) is the player.\n* Movement rules:\n  - You may move only through non-4 cells (i.e., never overlap a 4 after a move).\n  - If any part of your 8×8 sprite would overlap a 4 in the target direction (including cases where 4s lie “under” 9s), that move is ILLEGAL.\n  - If your sprite is already touching 4s on a side, you cannot move further in that touching direction until you have clearance.\n  - Practically: navigate corridors “between the 4s”.\n\n# KEYS, EXIT, AND HOW TO FIND THEM\n* The EXIT contains (or is adjacent to) the target key pattern and is marked by nearby 5s (it need not be fully surrounded; any 5s strongly indicate the exit region).\n* The bottom-left of the entire grid shows the REQUIRED KEY BLUEPRINT you must match: a specific layout of 0s (white) and 9s (blue).\n* Key generation mechanism (explicit):\n  - The KEY GENERATOR is a field/patch consisting of 0s and 9s that is NOT surrounded by 5s (i.e., not the exit).\n  - When any part of your 8×8 player walks onto this patch, a NEW candidate key is generated and displayed in the bottom-left.\n  - Step OFF the patch and then back ON to generate yet another candidate key; repeat to cycle through possibilities.\n  - You must keep cycling until the bottom-left candidate key EXACTLY matches the exit’s key (the same distribution of 0s and 9s seen within/adjacent to the 5s).\n* A reliable way to locate both the EXIT and the KEY GENERATOR area:\n  - Look for clusters of 0s and 9s reachable via 3s; if they are NOT framed by 5s, that area is most likely the generator. If you see 5s nearby framing a matching 0/9 pattern, that marks the exit.\n* When the pattern shown in the bottom-left matches the arrangement of 0s and 9s you see framed by (or adjacent to) 5s at the exit, move toward the 5s to complete the level.\n\n# HUD / PROGRESSION\n* Visual score on the second-to-last grid row (row 62): it contains several 4-cell “slots”.\n  - Slots made of 3s represent UNFINISHED levels.\n  - When a slot changes from 3s to another color, that level is COMPLETE.\n* Track remaining MOVES/ENERGY by counting tiles with value 15.\n* Track LIVES by counting distinct 2×2 blocks of 8s.\n\n# GENERAL NOTES\n* The grid is a bird’s-eye view.\n* If the grid does not change after an action, you likely attempted an illegal move into 4s.\n* Favor routes marked by 3s; scan for 0/9 patches (generator) and confirm exit by nearby 5s; confirm the key by matching the bottom-left blueprint of 0s/9s.\n\n# EXAMPLE STRATEGY OBSERVATION\nThe 8×8 player (top rows 12s, bottom rows 9s) is flush against 4s on the left, so LEFT is blocked. I can see a 0/9 patch reachable via 3s to the right (likely the generator) and some 5s beyond it, so I should move RIGHT toward that corridor, cycling the key on the generator until the bottom-left key matches the one at the exit.\n\n# TURN:\nCall exactly one action.\n"

    "content": "\n# CONTEXT:\nYou are an agent playing a dynamic game. Your objective is to\nWIN and avoid GAME_OVER while minimizing actions.\n\nOne action produces one Frame. One Frame is made of one or more sequential\nGrids. Each Grid is a matrix size INT<0,63> by INT<0,63> filled with\nINT<0,15> values. Each value represents a different color and usually implies a different object.\n\nYou are playing a game called LockSmith.\n\n# CONTROLS\n* RESET: start over\n* ACTION1: move up\n* ACTION2: move down\n* ACTION3: move left\n* ACTION4: move right\n* ACTION5/ACTION6: no-ops\n\n# GOAL\nFind/generate a key that MATCHES the key pattern shown at the EXIT, then navigate to the EXIT to finish the level.\nThere are 6 levels total. Complete all levels to WIN.\n\n# TILE MEANINGS (important ones)\n* 0 = white cell (used in key patterns)\n* 3 = walkable path / corridor marker (often outlines routes to key/exit)\n* 4 = WALL (solid). You cannot enter 4s.\n* 5 = EXIT indicator (presence of 5s marks/frames the exit area)\n* 8 = LIFE token (count lives as the number of 2×2 blocks of 8s)\n* 9 = blue cells (used in player lower body; also appear elsewhere in the map and in key logic)\n* 12 = orange cells (used in player upper body)\n* 15 = MOVE counter (number of 15s ≈ moves/energy left)\n\n# PLAYER (sprite + movement legality)\n* The player is an 8×8 sprite made ONLY of 12s (top two rows) over 9s (bottom six rows).\n  - Concretely: rows 0–1 (relative to the sprite) are all 12s; rows 2–7 are all 9s.\n  - Other scattered 9s on the board are NOT the player—only the exact 8×8 (2×8 of 12s stacked on 6×8 of 9s) is the player.\n* Movement rules:\n  - You may move only through non-4 cells (i.e., never overlap a 4 after a move).\n  - If any part of your 8×8 sprite would overlap a 4 in the target direction (including cases where 4s lie “under” 9s), that move is ILLEGAL.\n  - If your sprite is already touching 4s on a side, you cannot move further in that touching direction until you have clearance.\n  - Practically: navigate corridors “between the 4s”.\n\n# KEYS, EXIT, AND HOW TO FIND THEM\n* The EXIT contains (or is adjacent to) the target key pattern and is marked by nearby 5s (it need not be fully surrounded; any 5s strongly indicate the exit region).\n* The bottom-left of the entire grid shows the REQUIRED KEY BLUEPRINT you must match: a specific layout of 0s (white) and 9s (blue).\n* Key generation mechanism (explicit):\n  - The KEY GENERATOR is a field/patch consisting of 0s and 9s that is NOT surrounded by 5s (i.e., not the exit).\n  - When any part of your 8×8 player walks onto this patch, a NEW candidate key is generated and displayed in the bottom-left.\n  - Step OFF the patch and then back ON to generate yet another candidate key; repeat to cycle through possibilities.\n  - You must keep cycling until the bottom-left candidate key EXACTLY matches the exit’s key (the same distribution of 0s and 9s seen within/adjacent to the 5s).\n* A reliable way to locate both the EXIT and the KEY GENERATOR area:\n  - Look for clusters of 0s and 9s reachable via 3s; if they are NOT framed by 5s, that area is most likely the generator. If you see 5s nearby framing a matching 0/9 pattern, that marks the exit.\n* When the pattern shown in the bottom-left matches the arrangement of 0s and 9s you see framed by (or adjacent to) 5s at the exit, move toward the 5s to complete the level.\n\n# HUD / PROGRESSION\n* Visual score on the second-to-last grid row (row 62): it contains several 4-cell “slots”.\n  - Slots made of 3s represent UNFINISHED levels.\n  - When a slot changes from 3s to another color, that level is COMPLETE.\n* Track remaining MOVES/ENERGY by counting tiles with value 15.\n* Track LIVES by counting distinct 2×2 blocks of 8s.\n\n# GENERAL NOTES\n* The grid is a bird’s-eye view.\n* If the grid does not change after an action, you likely attempted an illegal move into 4s.\n* Favor routes marked by 3s; scan for 0/9 patches (generator) and confirm exit by nearby 5s; confirm the key by matching the bottom-left blueprint of 0s/9s.\n\n# EXAMPLE STRATEGY OBSERVATION\nThe 8×8 player (top rows 12s, bottom rows 9s) is flush against 4s on the left, so LEFT is blocked. I can see a 0/9 patch reachable via 3s to the right (likely the generator) and some 5s beyond it, so I should move RIGHT toward that corridor, cycling the key on the generator until the bottom-left key matches the one at the exit.\n\n# TURN:\nCall exactly one action.\n"

Once matched, head to the 5s exit."

You cannot enter 4s.\n* 5 = EXIT indicator (presence of 5s marks/frames the exit area)\n* 8 = LIFE token (count lives as the number of 2×2 blocks of 8s)\n* 9 = blue cells (used in player lower body; also appear elsewhere in the map and in key logic)\n* 12 = orange cells (used in player upper body)\n* 15 = MOVE counter (number of 15s ≈ moves/energy left)\n\n# PLAYER (sprite + movement legality)\n* The player is an 8×8 sprite made ONLY of 12s (top two rows) over 9s (bottom six rows).\n  - Concretely: rows 0–1 (relative to the sprite) are all 12s; rows 2–7 are all 9s.\n  - Other scattered 9s on the board are NOT the player—only the exact 8×8 (2×8 of 12s stacked on 6×8 of 9s) is the player.\n* Movement rules:\n  - You may move only through non-4 cells (i.e., never overlap a 4 after a move).\n  - If any part of your 8×8 sprite would overlap a 4 in the target direction (including cases where 4s lie “under” 9s), that move is ILLEGAL.\n  - If your sprite is already touching 4s on a side, you cannot move further in that touching direction until you have clearance.\n  - Practically: navigate corridors “between the 4s”.\n\n# KEYS, EXIT, AND HOW TO FIND THEM\n* The EXIT contains (or is adjacent to) the target key pattern and is marked by nearby 5s (it need not be fully surrounded; any 5s strongly indicate the exit region).\n* The bottom-left of the entire grid shows the REQUIRED KEY BLUEPRINT you must match: a specific layout of 0s (white) and 9s (blue).\n* Key generation mechanism (explicit):\n  - The KEY GENERATOR is a field/patch consisting of 0s and 9s that is NOT surrounded by 5s (i.e., not the exit).\n  - When any part of your 8×8 player walks onto this patch, a NEW candidate key is generated and displayed in the bottom-left.\n  - Step OFF the patch and then back ON to generate yet another candidate key; repeat to cycle through possibilities.\n  - You must keep cycling until the bottom-left candidate key EXACTLY matches the exit’s key (the same distribution of 0s and 9s seen within/adjacent to the 5s).\n* A reliable way to locate both the EXIT and the KEY GENERATOR area:\n  - Look for clusters of 0s and 9s reachable via 3s; if they are NOT framed by 5s, that area is most likely the generator. If you see 5s nearby framing a matching 0/9 pattern, that marks the exit.\n* When the pattern shown in the bottom-left matches the arrangement of 0s and 9s you see framed by (or adjacent to) 5s at the exit, move toward the 5s to complete the level.\n\n# HUD / PROGRESSION\n* Visual score on the second-to-last grid row (row 62): it contains several 4-cell “slots”.\n  - Slots made of 3s represent UNFINISHED levels.\n  - When a slot changes from 3s to another color, that level is COMPLETE.\n* Track remaining MOVES/ENERGY by counting tiles with value 15.\n* Track LIVES by counting distinct 2×2 blocks of 8s.\n\n# GENERAL NOTES\n* The grid is a bird’s-eye view.\n* If the grid does not change after an action, you likely attempted an illegal move into 4s.\n* Favor routes marked by 3s; scan for 0/9 patches (generator) and confirm exit by nearby 5s; confirm the key by matching the bottom-left blueprint of 0s/9s.\n\n# EXAMPLE STRATEGY OBSERVATION\nThe 8×8 player (top rows 12s, bottom rows 9s) is flush against 4s on the left, so LEFT is blocked. I can see a 0/9 patch reachable via 3s to the right (likely the generator) and some 5s beyond it, so I should move RIGHT toward that corridor, cycling the key on the generator until the bottom-left key matches the one at the exit.\n\n# TURN:\nCall exactly one action.\n"

    "content": "\n# CONTEXT:\nYou are an agent playing a dynamic game. Your objective is to\nWIN and avoid GAME_OVER while minimizing actions.\n\nOne action produces one Frame. One Frame is made of one or more sequential\nGrids. Each Grid is a matrix size INT<0,63> by INT<0,63> filled with\nINT<0,15> values. Each value represents a different color and usually implies a different object.\n\nYou are playing a game called LockSmith.\n\n# CONTROLS\n* RESET: start over\n* ACTION1: move up\n* ACTION2: move down\n* ACTION3: move left\n* ACTION4: move right\n* ACTION5/ACTION6: no-ops\n\n# GOAL\nFind/generate a key that MATCHES the key pattern shown at the EXIT, then navigate to the EXIT to finish the level.\nThere are 6 levels total. Complete all levels to WIN.\n\n# TILE MEANINGS (important ones)\n* 0 = white cell (used in key patterns)\n* 3 = walkable path / corridor marker (often outlines routes to key/exit)\n* 4 = WALL (solid). You cannot enter 4s.\n* 5 = EXIT indicator (presence of 5s marks/frames the exit area)\n* 8 = LIFE token (count lives as the number of 2×2 blocks of 8s)\n* 9 = blue cells (used in player lower body; also appear elsewhere in the map and in key logic)\n* 12 = orange cells (used in player upper body)\n* 15 = MOVE counter (number of 15s ≈ moves/energy left)\n\n# PLAYER (sprite + movement legality)\n* The player is an 8×8 sprite made ONLY of 12s (top two rows) over 9s (bottom six rows).\n  - Concretely: rows 0–1 (relative to the sprite) are all 12s; rows 2–7 are all 9s.\n  - Other scattered 9s on the board are NOT the player—only the exact 8×8 (2×8 of 12s stacked on 6×8 of 9s) is the player.\n* Movement rules:\n  - You may move only through non-4 cells (i.e., never overlap a 4 after a move).\n  - If any part of your 8×8 sprite would overlap a 4 in the target direction (including cases where 4s lie “under” 9s), that move is ILLEGAL.\n  - If your sprite is already touching 4s on a side, you cannot move further in that touching direction until you have clearance.\n  - Practically: navigate corridors “between the 4s”.\n\n# KEYS, EXIT, AND HOW TO FIND THEM\n* The EXIT contains (or is adjacent to) the target key pattern and is marked by nearby 5s (it need not be fully surrounded; any 5s strongly indicate the exit region).\n* The bottom-left of the entire grid shows the REQUIRED KEY BLUEPRINT you must match: a specific layout of 0s (white) and 9s (blue).\n* Key generation mechanism (explicit):\n  - The KEY GENERATOR is a field/patch consisting of 0s and 9s that is NOT surrounded by 5s (i.e., not the exit).\n  - When any part of your 8×8 player walks onto this patch, a NEW candidate key is generated and displayed in the bottom-left.\n  - Step OFF the patch and then back ON to generate yet another candidate key; repeat to cycle through possibilities.\n  - You must keep cycling until the bottom-left candidate key EXACTLY matches the exit’s key (the same distribution of 0s and 9s seen within/adjacent to the 5s).\n* A reliable way to locate both the EXIT and the KEY GENERATOR area:\n  - Look for clusters of 0s and 9s reachable via 3s; if they are NOT framed by 5s, that area is most likely the generator. If you see 5s nearby framing a matching 0/9 pattern, that marks the exit.\n* When the pattern shown in the bottom-left matches the arrangement of 0s and 9s you see framed by (or adjacent to) 5s at the exit, move toward the 5s to complete the level.\n\n# HUD / PROGRESSION\n* Visual score on the second-to-last grid row (row 62): it contains several 4-cell “slots”.\n  - Slots made of 3s represent UNFINISHED levels.\n  - When a slot changes from 3s to another color, that level is COMPLETE.\n* Track remaining MOVES/ENERGY by counting tiles with value 15.\n* Track LIVES by counting distinct 2×2 blocks of 8s.\n\n# GENERAL NOTES\n* The grid is a bird’s-eye view.\n* If the grid does not change after an action, you likely attempted an illegal move into 4s.\n* Favor routes marked by 3s; scan for 0/9 patches (generator) and confirm exit by nearby 5s; confirm the key by matching the bottom-left blueprint of 0s/9s.\n\n# EXAMPLE STRATEGY OBSERVATION\nThe 8×8 player (top rows 12s, bottom rows 9s) is flush against 4s on the left, so LEFT is blocked. I can see a 0/9 patch reachable via 3s to the right (likely the generator) and some 5s beyond it, so I should move RIGHT toward that corridor, cycling the key on the generator until the bottom-left key matches the one at the exit.\n\n# TURN:\nCall exactly one action.\n"

Once matched, head to the 5s exit."

    "content": "\n# CONTEXT:\nYou are an agent playing a dynamic game. Your objective is to\nWIN and avoid GAME_OVER while minimizing actions.\n\nOne action produces one Frame. One Frame is made of one or more sequential\nGrids. Each Grid is a matrix size INT<0,63> by INT<0,63> filled with\nINT<0,15> values. Each value represents a different color and usually implies a different object.\n\nYou are playing a game called LockSmith.\n\n# CONTROLS\n* RESET: start over\n* ACTION1: move up\n* ACTION2: move down\n* ACTION3: move left\n* ACTION4: move right\n* ACTION5/ACTION6: no-ops\n\n# GOAL\nFind/generate a key that MATCHES the key pattern shown at the EXIT, then navigate to the EXIT to finish the level.\nThere are 6 levels total. Complete all levels to WIN.\n\n# TILE MEANINGS (important ones)\n* 0 = white cell (used in key patterns)\n* 3 = walkable path / corridor marker (often outlines routes to key/exit)\n* 4 = WALL (solid). You cannot enter 4s.\n* 5 = EXIT indicator (presence of 5s marks/frames the exit area)\n* 8 = LIFE token (count lives as the number of 2×2 blocks of 8s)\n* 9 = blue cells (used in player lower body; also appear elsewhere in the map and in key logic)\n* 12 = orange cells (used in player upper body)\n* 15 = MOVE counter (number of 15s ≈ moves/energy left)\n\n# PLAYER (sprite + movement legality)\n* The player is an 8×8 sprite made ONLY of 12s (top two rows) over 9s (bottom six rows).\n  - Concretely: rows 0–1 (relative to the sprite) are all 12s; rows 2–7 are all 9s.\n  - Other scattered 9s on the board are NOT the player—only the exact 8×8 (2×8 of 12s stacked on 6×8 of 9s) is the player.\n* Movement rules:\n  - You may move only through non-4 cells (i.e., never overlap a 4 after a move).\n  - If any part of your 8×8 sprite would overlap a 4 in the target direction (including cases where 4s lie “under” 9s), that move is ILLEGAL.\n  - If your sprite is already touching 4s on a side, you cannot move further in that touching direction until you have clearance.\n  - Practically: navigate corridors “between the 4s”.\n\n# KEYS, EXIT, AND HOW TO FIND THEM\n* The EXIT contains (or is adjacent to) the target key pattern and is marked by nearby 5s (it need not be fully surrounded; any 5s strongly indicate the exit region).\n* The bottom-left of the entire grid shows the REQUIRED KEY BLUEPRINT you must match: a specific layout of 0s (white) and 9s (blue).\n* Key generation mechanism (explicit):\n  - The KEY GENERATOR is a field/patch consisting of 0s and 9s that is NOT surrounded by 5s (i.e., not the exit).\n  - When any part of your 8×8 player walks onto this patch, a NEW candidate key is generated and displayed in the bottom-left.\n  - Step OFF the patch and then back ON to generate yet another candidate key; repeat to cycle through possibilities.\n  - You must keep cycling until the bottom-left candidate key EXACTLY matches the exit’s key (the same distribution of 0s and 9s seen within/adjacent to the 5s).\n* A reliable way to locate both the EXIT and the KEY GENERATOR area:\n  - Look for clusters of 0s and 9s reachable via 3s; if they are NOT framed by 5s, that area is most likely the generator. If you see 5s nearby framing a matching 0/9 pattern, that marks the exit.\n* When the pattern shown in the bottom-left matches the arrangement of 0s and 9s you see framed by (or adjacent to) 5s at the exit, move toward the 5s to complete the level.\n\n# HUD / PROGRESSION\n* Visual score on the second-to-last grid row (row 62): it contains several 4-cell “slots”.\n  - Slots made of 3s represent UNFINISHED levels.\n  - When a slot changes from 3s to another color, that level is COMPLETE.\n* Track remaining MOVES/ENERGY by counting tiles with value 15.\n* Track LIVES by counting distinct 2×2 blocks of 8s.\n\n# GENERAL NOTES\n* The grid is a bird’s-eye view.\n* If the grid does not change after an action, you likely attempted an illegal move into 4s.\n* Favor routes marked by 3s; scan for 0/9 patches (generator) and confirm exit by nearby 5s; confirm the key by matching the bottom-left blueprint of 0s/9s.\n\n# EXAMPLE STRATEGY OBSERVATION\nThe 8×8 player (top rows 12s, bottom rows 9s) is flush against 4s on the left, so LEFT is blocked. I can see a 0/9 patch reachable via 3s to the right (likely the generator) and some 5s beyond it, so I should move RIGHT toward that corridor, cycling the key on the generator until the bottom-left key matches the one at the exit.\n\n# TURN:\nCall exactly one action.\n"

There is a noticeable cluster of 0/9 pattern toward the lower-right area that likely corresponds to the KEY GENERATOR region, and there are nearby 5s indicating the EXIT region. The bottom-left blueprint of 0/9 will be our target key to match at the exit.

One Frame is made of one or more sequential\nGrids. Each Grid is a matrix size INT<0,63> by INT<0,63> filled with\nINT<0,15> values. Each value represents a different color and usually implies a different object.\n\nYou are playing a game called LockSmith.\n\n# CONTROLS\n* RESET: start over\n* ACTION1: move up\n* ACTION2: move down\n* ACTION3: move left\n* ACTION4: move right\n* ACTION5/ACTION6: no-ops\n\n# GOAL\nFind/generate a key that MATCHES the key pattern shown at the EXIT, then navigate to the EXIT to finish the level.\nThere are 6 levels total. Complete all levels to WIN.\n\n# TILE MEANINGS (important ones)\n* 0 = white cell (used in key patterns)\n* 3 = walkable path / corridor marker (often outlines routes to key/exit)\n* 4 = WALL (solid). You cannot enter 4s.\n* 5 = EXIT indicator (presence of 5s marks/frames the exit area)\n* 8 = LIFE token (count lives as the number of 2×2 blocks of 8s)\n* 9 = blue cells (used in player lower body; also appear elsewhere in the map and in key logic)\n* 12 = orange cells (used in player upper body)\n* 15 = MOVE counter (number of 15s ≈ moves/energy left)\n\n# PLAYER (sprite + movement legality)\n* The player is an 8×8 sprite made ONLY of 12s (top two rows) over 9s (bottom six rows).\n  - Concretely: rows 0–1 (relative to the sprite) are all 12s; rows 2–7 are all 9s.\n  - Other scattered 9s on the board are NOT the player—only the exact 8×8 (2×8 of 12s stacked on 6×8 of 9s) is the player.\n* Movement rules:\n  - You may move only through non-4 cells (i.e., never overlap a 4 after a move).\n  - If any part of your 8×8 sprite would overlap a 4 in the target direction (including cases where 4s lie “under” 9s), that move is ILLEGAL.\n  - If your sprite is already touching 4s on a side, you cannot move further in that touching direction until you have clearance.\n  - Practically: navigate corridors “between the 4s”.\n\n# KEYS, EXIT, AND HOW TO FIND THEM\n* The EXIT contains (or is adjacent to) the target key pattern and is marked by nearby 5s (it need not be fully surrounded; any 5s strongly indicate the exit region).\n* The bottom-left of the entire grid shows the REQUIRED KEY BLUEPRINT you must match: a specific layout of 0s (white) and 9s (blue).\n* Key generation mechanism (explicit):\n  - The KEY GENERATOR is a field/patch consisting of 0s and 9s that is NOT surrounded by 5s (i.e., not the exit).\n  - When any part of your 8×8 player walks onto this patch, a NEW candidate key is generated and displayed in the bottom-left.\n  - Step OFF the patch and then back ON to generate yet another candidate key; repeat to cycle through possibilities.\n  - You must keep cycling until the bottom-left candidate key EXACTLY matches the exit’s key (the same distribution of 0s and 9s seen within/adjacent to the 5s).\n* A reliable way to locate both the EXIT and the KEY GENERATOR area:\n  - Look for clusters of 0s and 9s reachable via 3s; if they are NOT framed by 5s, that area is most likely the generator. If you see 5s nearby framing a matching 0/9 pattern, that marks the exit.\n* When the pattern shown in the bottom-left matches the arrangement of 0s and 9s you see framed by (or adjacent to) 5s at the exit, move toward the 5s to complete the level.\n\n# HUD / PROGRESSION\n* Visual score on the second-to-last grid row (row 62): it contains several 4-cell “slots”.\n  - Slots made of 3s represent UNFINISHED levels.\n  - When a slot changes from 3s to another color, that level is COMPLETE.\n* Track remaining MOVES/ENERGY by counting tiles with value 15.\n* Track LIVES by counting distinct 2×2 blocks of 8s.\n\n# GENERAL NOTES\n* The grid is a bird’s-eye view.\n* If the grid does not change after an action, you likely attempted an illegal move into 4s.\n* Favor routes marked by 3s; scan for 0/9 patches (generator) and confirm exit by nearby 5s; confirm the key by matching the bottom-left blueprint of 0s/9s.\n\n# EXAMPLE STRATEGY OBSERVATION\nThe 8×8 player (top rows 12s, bottom rows 9s) is flush against 4s on the left, so LEFT is blocked. I can see a 0/9 patch reachable via 3s to the right (likely the generator) and some 5s beyond it, so I should move RIGHT toward that corridor, cycling the key on the generator until the bottom-left key matches the one at the exit.\n\n# TURN:\nCall exactly one action.\n"

    "content": "\n# CONTEXT:\nYou are an agent playing a dynamic game. Your objective is to\nWIN and avoid GAME_OVER while minimizing actions.\n\nOne action produces one Frame. One Frame is made of one or more sequential\nGrids. Each Grid is a matrix size INT<0,63> by INT<0,63> filled with\nINT<0,15> values. Each value represents a different color and usually implies a different object.\n\nYou are playing a game called LockSmith.\n\n# CONTROLS\n* RESET: start over\n* ACTION1: move up\n* ACTION2: move down\n* ACTION3: move left\n* ACTION4: move right\n* ACTION5/ACTION6: no-ops\n\n# GOAL\nFind/generate a key that MATCHES the key pattern shown at the EXIT, then navigate to the EXIT to finish the level.\nThere are 6 levels total. Complete all levels to WIN.\n\n# TILE MEANINGS (important ones)\n* 0 = white cell (used in key patterns)\n* 3 = walkable path / corridor marker (often outlines routes to key/exit)\n* 4 = WALL (solid). You cannot enter 4s.\n* 5 = EXIT indicator (presence of 5s marks/frames the exit area)\n* 8 = LIFE token (count lives as the number of 2×2 blocks of 8s)\n* 9 = blue cells (used in player lower body; also appear elsewhere in the map and in key logic)\n* 12 = orange cells (used in player upper body)\n* 15 = MOVE counter (number of 15s ≈ moves/energy left)\n\n# PLAYER (sprite + movement legality)\n* The player is an 8×8 sprite made ONLY of 12s (top two rows) over 9s (bottom six rows).\n  - Concretely: rows 0–1 (relative to the sprite) are all 12s; rows 2–7 are all 9s.\n  - Other scattered 9s on the board are NOT the player—only the exact 8×8 (2×8 of 12s stacked on 6×8 of 9s) is the player.\n* Movement rules:\n  - You may move only through non-4 cells (i.e., never overlap a 4 after a move).\n  - If any part of your 8×8 sprite would overlap a 4 in the target direction (including cases where 4s lie “under” 9s), that move is ILLEGAL.\n  - If your sprite is already touching 4s on a side, you cannot move further in that touching direction until you have clearance.\n  - Practically: navigate corridors “between the 4s”.\n\n# KEYS, EXIT, AND HOW TO FIND THEM\n* The EXIT contains (or is adjacent to) the target key pattern and is marked by nearby 5s (it need not be fully surrounded; any 5s strongly indicate the exit region).\n* The bottom-left of the entire grid shows the REQUIRED KEY BLUEPRINT you must match: a specific layout of 0s (white) and 9s (blue).\n* Key generation mechanism (explicit):\n  - The KEY GENERATOR is a field/patch consisting of 0s and 9s that is NOT surrounded by 5s (i.e., not the exit).\n  - When any part of your 8×8 player walks onto this patch, a NEW candidate key is generated and displayed in the bottom-left.\n  - Step OFF the patch and then back ON to generate yet another candidate key; repeat to cycle through possibilities.\n  - You must keep cycling until the bottom-left candidate key EXACTLY matches the exit’s key (the same distribution of 0s and 9s seen within/adjacent to the 5s).\n* A reliable way to locate both the EXIT and the KEY GENERATOR area:\n  - Look for clusters of 0s and 9s reachable via 3s; if they are NOT framed by 5s, that area is most likely the generator. If you see 5s nearby framing a matching 0/9 pattern, that marks the exit.\n* When the pattern shown in the bottom-left matches the arrangement of 0s and 9s you see framed by (or adjacent to) 5s at the exit, move toward the 5s to complete the level.\n\n# HUD / PROGRESSION\n* Visual score on the second-to-last grid row (row 62): it contains several 4-cell “slots”.\n  - Slots made of 3s represent UNFINISHED levels.\n  - When a slot changes from 3s to another color, that level is COMPLETE.\n* Track remaining MOVES/ENERGY by counting tiles with value 15.\n* Track LIVES by counting distinct 2×2 blocks of 8s.\n\n# GENERAL NOTES\n* The grid is a bird’s-eye view.\n* If the grid does not change after an action, you likely attempted an illegal move into 4s.\n* Favor routes marked by 3s; scan for 0/9 patches (generator) and confirm exit by nearby 5s; confirm the key by matching the bottom-left blueprint of 0s/9s.\n\n# EXAMPLE STRATEGY OBSERVATION\nThe 8×8 player (top rows 12s, bottom rows 9s) is flush against 4s on the left, so LEFT is blocked. I can see a 0/9 patch reachable via 3s to the right (likely the generator) and some 5s beyond it, so I should move RIGHT toward that corridor, cycling the key on the generator until the bottom-left key matches the one at the exit.\n\n# TURN:\nCall exactly one action.\n"

There is a noticeable cluster of 0/9 pattern toward the lower-right area that likely corresponds to the KEY GENERATOR region, and there are nearby 5s indicating the EXIT region. The bottom-left blueprint of 0/9 will be our target key to match at the exit. To reach the generator, we should stay along the 3s corridors and begin cycling keys on the generator patch.\n\nAction choice:\n- Move RIGHT (ACTION4) to advance along the visible corridor toward the generator area."

    "content": "\n# CONTEXT:\nYou are an agent playing a dynamic game. Your objective is to\nWIN and avoid GAME_OVER while minimizing actions.\n\nOne action produces one Frame. One Frame is made of one or more sequential\nGrids. Each Grid is a matrix size INT<0,63> by INT<0,63> filled with\nINT<0,15> values. Each value represents a different color and usually implies a different object.\n\nYou are playing a game called LockSmith.\n\n# CONTROLS\n* RESET: start over\n* ACTION1: move up\n* ACTION2: move down\n* ACTION3: move left\n* ACTION4: move right\n* ACTION5/ACTION6: no-ops\n\n# GOAL\nFind/generate a key that MATCHES the key pattern shown at the EXIT, then navigate to the EXIT to finish the level.\nThere are 6 levels total. Complete all levels to WIN.\n\n# TILE MEANINGS (important ones)\n* 0 = white cell (used in key patterns)\n* 3 = walkable path / corridor marker (often outlines routes to key/exit)\n* 4 = WALL (solid). You cannot enter 4s.\n* 5 = EXIT indicator (presence of 5s marks/frames the exit area)\n* 8 = LIFE token (count lives as the number of 2×2 blocks of 8s)\n* 9 = blue cells (used in player lower body; also appear elsewhere in the map and in key logic)\n* 12 = orange cells (used in player upper body)\n* 15 = MOVE counter (number of 15s ≈ moves/energy left)\n\n# PLAYER (sprite + movement legality)\n* The player is an 8×8 sprite made ONLY of 12s (top two rows) over 9s (bottom six rows).\n  - Concretely: rows 0–1 (relative to the sprite) are all 12s; rows 2–7 are all 9s.\n  - Other scattered 9s on the board are NOT the player—only the exact 8×8 (2×8 of 12s stacked on 6×8 of 9s) is the player.\n* Movement rules:\n  - You may move only through non-4 cells (i.e., never overlap a 4 after a move).\n  - If any part of your 8×8 sprite would overlap a 4 in the target direction (including cases where 4s lie “under” 9s), that move is ILLEGAL.\n  - If your sprite is already touching 4s on a side, you cannot move further in that touching direction until you have clearance.\n  - Practically: navigate corridors “between the 4s”.\n\n# KEYS, EXIT, AND HOW TO FIND THEM\n* The EXIT contains (or is adjacent to) the target key pattern and is marked by nearby 5s (it need not be fully surrounded; any 5s strongly indicate the exit region).\n* The bottom-left of the entire grid shows the REQUIRED KEY BLUEPRINT you must match: a specific layout of 0s (white) and 9s (blue).\n* Key generation mechanism (explicit):\n  - The KEY GENERATOR is a field/patch consisting of 0s and 9s that is NOT surrounded by 5s (i.e., not the exit).\n  - When any part of your 8×8 player walks onto this patch, a NEW candidate key is generated and displayed in the bottom-left.\n  - Step OFF the patch and then back ON to generate yet another candidate key; repeat to cycle through possibilities.\n  - You must keep cycling until the bottom-left candidate key EXACTLY matches the exit’s key (the same distribution of 0s and 9s seen within/adjacent to the 5s).\n* A reliable way to locate both the EXIT and the KEY GENERATOR area:\n  - Look for clusters of 0s and 9s reachable via 3s; if they are NOT framed by 5s, that area is most likely the generator. If you see 5s nearby framing a matching 0/9 pattern, that marks the exit.\n* When the pattern shown in the bottom-left matches the arrangement of 0s and 9s you see framed by (or adjacent to) 5s at the exit, move toward the 5s to complete the level.\n\n# HUD / PROGRESSION\n* Visual score on the second-to-last grid row (row 62): it contains several 4-cell “slots”.\n  - Slots made of 3s represent UNFINISHED levels.\n  - When a slot changes from 3s to another color, that level is COMPLETE.\n* Track remaining MOVES/ENERGY by counting tiles with value 15.\n* Track LIVES by counting distinct 2×2 blocks of 8s.\n\n# GENERAL NOTES\n* The grid is a bird’s-eye view.\n* If the grid does not change after an action, you likely attempted an illegal move into 4s.\n* Favor routes marked by 3s; scan for 0/9 patches (generator) and confirm exit by nearby 5s; confirm the key by matching the bottom-left blueprint of 0s/9s.\n\n# EXAMPLE STRATEGY OBSERVATION\nThe 8×8 player (top rows 12s, bottom rows 9s) is flush against 4s on the left, so LEFT is blocked. I can see a 0/9 patch reachable via 3s to the right (likely the generator) and some 5s beyond it, so I should move RIGHT toward that corridor, cycling the key on the generator until the bottom-left key matches the one at the exit.\n\n# TURN:\nCall exactly one action.\n"

There is a noticeable patch containing 0/9 values toward the lower-left area, which is likely the key generator region, and there are nearby 5s marking the EXIT region in the mid-to-right area. The bottom-left area shows a dense 0/9 pattern that seems to correspond to the target key blueprint. Plan: move along a 3s corridor toward the generator patch, step onto the patch to generate candidate keys, cycle until the bottom-left key matches the exit’s key, then navigate toward the 5s EXIT."

    "content": "\n# CONTEXT:\nYou are an agent playing a dynamic game. Your objective is to\nWIN and avoid GAME_OVER while minimizing actions.\n\nOne action produces one Frame. One Frame is made of one or more sequential\nGrids. Each Grid is a matrix size INT<0,63> by INT<0,63> filled with\nINT<0,15> values. Each value represents a different color and usually implies a different object.\n\nYou are playing a game called LockSmith.\n\n# CONTROLS\n* RESET: start over\n* ACTION1: move up\n* ACTION2: move down\n* ACTION3: move left\n* ACTION4: move right\n* ACTION5/ACTION6: no-ops\n\n# GOAL\nFind/generate a key that MATCHES the key pattern shown at the EXIT, then navigate to the EXIT to finish the level.\nThere are 6 levels total. Complete all levels to WIN.\n\n# TILE MEANINGS (important ones)\n* 0 = white cell (used in key patterns)\n* 3 = walkable path / corridor marker (often outlines routes to key/exit)\n* 4 = WALL (solid). You cannot enter 4s.\n* 5 = EXIT indicator (presence of 5s marks/frames the exit area)\n* 8 = LIFE token (count lives as the number of 2×2 blocks of 8s)\n* 9 = blue cells (used in player lower body; also appear elsewhere in the map and in key logic)\n* 12 = orange cells (used in player upper body)\n* 15 = MOVE counter (number of 15s ≈ moves/energy left)\n\n# PLAYER (sprite + movement legality)\n* The player is an 8×8 sprite made ONLY of 12s (top two rows) over 9s (bottom six rows).\n  - Concretely: rows 0–1 (relative to the sprite) are all 12s; rows 2–7 are all 9s.\n  - Other scattered 9s on the board are NOT the player—only the exact 8×8 (2×8 of 12s stacked on 6×8 of 9s) is the player.\n* Movement rules:\n  - You may move only through non-4 cells (i.e., never overlap a 4 after a move).\n  - If any part of your 8×8 sprite would overlap a 4 in the target direction (including cases where 4s lie “under” 9s), that move is ILLEGAL.\n  - If your sprite is already touching 4s on a side, you cannot move further in that touching direction until you have clearance.\n  - Practically: navigate corridors “between the 4s”.\n\n# KEYS, EXIT, AND HOW TO FIND THEM\n* The EXIT contains (or is adjacent to) the target key pattern and is marked by nearby 5s (it need not be fully surrounded; any 5s strongly indicate the exit region).\n* The bottom-left of the entire grid shows the REQUIRED KEY BLUEPRINT you must match: a specific layout of 0s (white) and 9s (blue).\n* Key generation mechanism (explicit):\n  - The KEY GENERATOR is a field/patch consisting of 0s and 9s that is NOT surrounded by 5s (i.e., not the exit).\n  - When any part of your 8×8 player walks onto this patch, a NEW candidate key is generated and displayed in the bottom-left.\n  - Step OFF the patch and then back ON to generate yet another candidate key; repeat to cycle through possibilities.\n  - You must keep cycling until the bottom-left candidate key EXACTLY matches the exit’s key (the same distribution of 0s and 9s seen within/adjacent to the 5s).\n* A reliable way to locate both the EXIT and the KEY GENERATOR area:\n  - Look for clusters of 0s and 9s reachable via 3s; if they are NOT framed by 5s, that area is most likely the generator. If you see 5s nearby framing a matching 0/9 pattern, that marks the exit.\n* When the pattern shown in the bottom-left matches the arrangement of 0s and 9s you see framed by (or adjacent to) 5s at the exit, move toward the 5s to complete the level.\n\n# HUD / PROGRESSION\n* Visual score on the second-to-last grid row (row 62): it contains several 4-cell “slots”.\n  - Slots made of 3s represent UNFINISHED levels.\n  - When a slot changes from 3s to another color, that level is COMPLETE.\n* Track remaining MOVES/ENERGY by counting tiles with value 15.\n* Track LIVES by counting distinct 2×2 blocks of 8s.\n\n# GENERAL NOTES\n* The grid is a bird’s-eye view.\n* If the grid does not change after an action, you likely attempted an illegal move into 4s.\n* Favor routes marked by 3s; scan for 0/9 patches (generator) and confirm exit by nearby 5s; confirm the key by matching the bottom-left blueprint of 0s/9s.\n\n# EXAMPLE STRATEGY OBSERVATION\nThe 8×8 player (top rows 12s, bottom rows 9s) is flush against 4s on the left, so LEFT is blocked. I can see a 0/9 patch reachable via 3s to the right (likely the generator) and some 5s beyond it, so I should move RIGHT toward that corridor, cycling the key on the generator until the bottom-left key matches the one at the exit.\n\n# TURN:\nCall exactly one action.\n"

The bottom-left area shows a dense 0/9 pattern that seems to correspond to the target key blueprint.

    "content": "\n# CONTEXT:\nYou are an agent playing a dynamic game. Your objective is to\nWIN and avoid GAME_OVER while minimizing actions.\n\nOne action produces one Frame. One Frame is made of one or more sequential\nGrids. Each Grid is a matrix size INT<0,63> by INT<0,63> filled with\nINT<0,15> values. Each value represents a different color and usually implies a different object.\n\nYou are playing a game called LockSmith.\n\n# CONTROLS\n* RESET: start over\n* ACTION1: move up\n* ACTION2: move down\n* ACTION3: move left\n* ACTION4: move right\n* ACTION5/ACTION6: no-ops\n\n# GOAL\nFind/generate a key that MATCHES the key pattern shown at the EXIT, then navigate to the EXIT to finish the level.\nThere are 6 levels total. Complete all levels to WIN.\n\n# TILE MEANINGS (important ones)\n* 0 = white cell (used in key patterns)\n* 3 = walkable path / corridor marker (often outlines routes to key/exit)\n* 4 = WALL (solid).

There is a noticeable patch containing 0/9 values toward the lower-left area, which is likely the key generator region, and there are nearby 5s marking the EXIT region in the mid-to-right area. The bottom-left area shows a dense 0/9 pattern that seems to correspond to the target key blueprint. Plan: move along a 3s corridor toward the generator patch, step onto the patch to generate candidate keys, cycle until the bottom-left key matches the exit’s key, then navigate toward the 5s EXIT."

The bottom-left area features a dense 0/9 patch (likely the key generator) that is accessible via a clear 3-path, while the exit region with nearby 5s appears toward the upper-right side of the map.\n\nStrategy note:\n- Head along the visible 3 corridor toward the bottom-left generator patch, since stepping onto that 0/9 patch will cycle candidate keys. Once there, step off and back onto the patch to cycle keys, aiming to match the bottom-left blueprint with the exit’s 5-adjacent pattern.

    "content": "\n# CONTEXT:\nYou are an agent playing a dynamic game. Your objective is to\nWIN and avoid GAME_OVER while minimizing actions.\n\nOne action produces one Frame. One Frame is made of one or more sequential\nGrids. Each Grid is a matrix size INT<0,63> by INT<0,63> filled with\nINT<0,15> values. Each value represents a different color and usually implies a different object.\n\nYou are playing a game called LockSmith.\n\n# CONTROLS\n* RESET: start over\n* ACTION1: move up\n* ACTION2: move down\n* ACTION3: move left\n* ACTION4: move right\n* ACTION5/ACTION6: no-ops\n\n# GOAL\nFind/generate a key that MATCHES the key pattern shown at the EXIT, then navigate to the EXIT to finish the level.\nThere are 6 levels total. Complete all levels to WIN.\n\n# TILE MEANINGS (important ones)\n* 0 = white cell (used in key patterns)\n* 3 = walkable path / corridor marker (often outlines routes to key/exit)\n* 4 = WALL (solid). You cannot enter 4s.\n* 5 = EXIT indicator (presence of 5s marks/frames the exit area)\n* 8 = LIFE token (count lives as the number of 2×2 blocks of 8s)\n* 9 = blue cells (used in player lower body; also appear elsewhere in the map and in key logic)\n* 12 = orange cells (used in player upper body)\n* 15 = MOVE counter (number of 15s ≈ moves/energy left)\n\n# PLAYER (sprite + movement legality)\n* The player is an 8×8 sprite made ONLY of 12s (top two rows) over 9s (bottom six rows).\n  - Concretely: rows 0–1 (relative to the sprite) are all 12s; rows 2–7 are all 9s.\n  - Other scattered 9s on the board are NOT the player—only the exact 8×8 (2×8 of 12s stacked on 6×8 of 9s) is the player.\n* Movement rules:\n  - You may move only through non-4 cells (i.e., never overlap a 4 after a move).\n  - If any part of your 8×8 sprite would overlap a 4 in the target direction (including cases where 4s lie “under” 9s), that move is ILLEGAL.\n  - If your sprite is already touching 4s on a side, you cannot move further in that touching direction until you have clearance.\n  - Practically: navigate corridors “between the 4s”.\n\n# KEYS, EXIT, AND HOW TO FIND THEM\n* The EXIT contains (or is adjacent to) the target key pattern and is marked by nearby 5s (it need not be fully surrounded; any 5s strongly indicate the exit region).\n* The bottom-left of the entire grid shows the REQUIRED KEY BLUEPRINT you must match: a specific layout of 0s (white) and 9s (blue).\n* Key generation mechanism (explicit):\n  - The KEY GENERATOR is a field/patch consisting of 0s and 9s that is NOT surrounded by 5s (i.e., not the exit).\n  - When any part of your 8×8 player walks onto this patch, a NEW candidate key is generated and displayed in the bottom-left.\n  - Step OFF the patch and then back ON to generate yet another candidate key; repeat to cycle through possibilities.\n  - You must keep cycling until the bottom-left candidate key EXACTLY matches the exit’s key (the same distribution of 0s and 9s seen within/adjacent to the 5s).\n* A reliable way to locate both the EXIT and the KEY GENERATOR area:\n  - Look for clusters of 0s and 9s reachable via 3s; if they are NOT framed by 5s, that area is most likely the generator. If you see 5s nearby framing a matching 0/9 pattern, that marks the exit.\n* When the pattern shown in the bottom-left matches the arrangement of 0s and 9s you see framed by (or adjacent to) 5s at the exit, move toward the 5s to complete the level.\n\n# HUD / PROGRESSION\n* Visual score on the second-to-last grid row (row 62): it contains several 4-cell “slots”.\n  - Slots made of 3s represent UNFINISHED levels.\n  - When a slot changes from 3s to another color, that level is COMPLETE.\n* Track remaining MOVES/ENERGY by counting tiles with value 15.\n* Track LIVES by counting distinct 2×2 blocks of 8s.\n\n# GENERAL NOTES\n* The grid is a bird’s-eye view.\n* If the grid does not change after an action, you likely attempted an illegal move into 4s.\n* Favor routes marked by 3s; scan for 0/9 patches (generator) and confirm exit by nearby 5s; confirm the key by matching the bottom-left blueprint of 0s/9s.\n\n# EXAMPLE STRATEGY OBSERVATION\nThe 8×8 player (top rows 12s, bottom rows 9s) is flush against 4s on the left, so LEFT is blocked. I can see a 0/9 patch reachable via 3s to the right (likely the generator) and some 5s beyond it, so I should move RIGHT toward that corridor, cycling the key on the generator until the bottom-left key matches the one at the exit.\n\n# TURN:\nCall exactly one action.\n"

A patch of 0s and 9s appears near the bottom area, which is likely the KEY GENERATOR, while there are 5s clustered around the upper-right area indicating the EXIT region.\n\nStrategy:\n- Move along a reachable 3-corridor toward the bottom area to step onto the 0/9 generator patch, then step off and back on to cycle candidate keys. Repeat until the bottom-left blueprint (the required 0/9 pattern) matches the exit’s key pattern, which is marked by nearby 5s. Once matched, head toward the 5s/EXIT region to finish."

    "content": "\n# CONTEXT:\nYou are an agent playing a dynamic game. Your objective is to\nWIN and avoid GAME_OVER while minimizing actions.\n\nOne action produces one Frame. One Frame is made of one or more sequential\nGrids. Each Grid is a matrix size INT<0,63> by INT<0,63> filled with\nINT<0,15> values. Each value represents a different color and usually implies a different object.\n\nYou are playing a game called LockSmith.\n\n# CONTROLS\n* RESET: start over\n* ACTION1: move up\n* ACTION2: move down\n* ACTION3: move left\n* ACTION4: move right\n* ACTION5/ACTION6: no-ops\n\n# GOAL\nFind/generate a key that MATCHES the key pattern shown at the EXIT, then navigate to the EXIT to finish the level.\nThere are 6 levels total. Complete all levels to WIN.\n\n# TILE MEANINGS (important ones)\n* 0 = white cell (used in key patterns)\n* 3 = walkable path / corridor marker (often outlines routes to key/exit)\n* 4 = WALL (solid). You cannot enter 4s.\n* 5 = EXIT indicator (presence of 5s marks/frames the exit area)\n* 8 = LIFE token (count lives as the number of 2×2 blocks of 8s)\n* 9 = blue cells (used in player lower body; also appear elsewhere in the map and in key logic)\n* 12 = orange cells (used in player upper body)\n* 15 = MOVE counter (number of 15s ≈ moves/energy left)\n\n# PLAYER (sprite + movement legality)\n* The player is an 8×8 sprite made ONLY of 12s (top two rows) over 9s (bottom six rows).\n  - Concretely: rows 0–1 (relative to the sprite) are all 12s; rows 2–7 are all 9s.\n  - Other scattered 9s on the board are NOT the player—only the exact 8×8 (2×8 of 12s stacked on 6×8 of 9s) is the player.\n* Movement rules:\n  - You may move only through non-4 cells (i.e., never overlap a 4 after a move).\n  - If any part of your 8×8 sprite would overlap a 4 in the target direction (including cases where 4s lie “under” 9s), that move is ILLEGAL.\n  - If your sprite is already touching 4s on a side, you cannot move further in that touching direction until you have clearance.\n  - Practically: navigate corridors “between the 4s”.\n\n# KEYS, EXIT, AND HOW TO FIND THEM\n* The EXIT contains (or is adjacent to) the target key pattern and is marked by nearby 5s (it need not be fully surrounded; any 5s strongly indicate the exit region).\n* The bottom-left of the entire grid shows the REQUIRED KEY BLUEPRINT you must match: a specific layout of 0s (white) and 9s (blue).\n* Key generation mechanism (explicit):\n  - The KEY GENERATOR is a field/patch consisting of 0s and 9s that is NOT surrounded by 5s (i.e., not the exit).\n  - When any part of your 8×8 player walks onto this patch, a NEW candidate key is generated and displayed in the bottom-left.\n  - Step OFF the patch and then back ON to generate yet another candidate key; repeat to cycle through possibilities.\n  - You must keep cycling until the bottom-left candidate key EXACTLY matches the exit’s key (the same distribution of 0s and 9s seen within/adjacent to the 5s).\n* A reliable way to locate both the EXIT and the KEY GENERATOR area:\n  - Look for clusters of 0s and 9s reachable via 3s; if they are NOT framed by 5s, that area is most likely the generator. If you see 5s nearby framing a matching 0/9 pattern, that marks the exit.\n* When the pattern shown in the bottom-left matches the arrangement of 0s and 9s you see framed by (or adjacent to) 5s at the exit, move toward the 5s to complete the level.\n\n# HUD / PROGRESSION\n* Visual score on the second-to-last grid row (row 62): it contains several 4-cell “slots”.\n  - Slots made of 3s represent UNFINISHED levels.\n  - When a slot changes from 3s to another color, that level is COMPLETE.\n* Track remaining MOVES/ENERGY by counting tiles with value 15.\n* Track LIVES by counting distinct 2×2 blocks of 8s.\n\n# GENERAL NOTES\n* The grid is a bird’s-eye view.\n* If the grid does not change after an action, you likely attempted an illegal move into 4s.\n* Favor routes marked by 3s; scan for 0/9 patches (generator) and confirm exit by nearby 5s; confirm the key by matching the bottom-left blueprint of 0s/9s.\n\n# EXAMPLE STRATEGY OBSERVATION\nThe 8×8 player (top rows 12s, bottom rows 9s) is flush against 4s on the left, so LEFT is blocked. I can see a 0/9 patch reachable via 3s to the right (likely the generator) and some 5s beyond it, so I should move RIGHT toward that corridor, cycling the key on the generator until the bottom-left key matches the one at the exit.\n\n# TURN:\nCall exactly one action.\n"

    "content": "\n# CONTEXT:\nYou are an agent playing a dynamic game. Your objective is to\nWIN and avoid GAME_OVER while minimizing actions.\n\nOne action produces one Frame. One Frame is made of one or more sequential\nGrids. Each Grid is a matrix size INT<0,63> by INT<0,63> filled with\nINT<0,15> values. Each value represents a different color and usually implies a different object.\n\nYou are playing a game called LockSmith.\n\n# CONTROLS\n* RESET: start over\n* ACTION1: move up\n* ACTION2: move down\n* ACTION3: move left\n* ACTION4: move right\n* ACTION5/ACTION6: no-ops\n\n# GOAL\nFind/generate a key that MATCHES the key pattern shown at the EXIT, then navigate to the EXIT to finish the level.\nThere are 6 levels total. Complete all levels to WIN.\n\n# TILE MEANINGS (important ones)\n* 0 = white cell (used in key patterns)\n* 3 = walkable path / corridor marker (often outlines routes to key/exit)\n* 4 = WALL (solid). You cannot enter 4s.\n* 5 = EXIT indicator (presence of 5s marks/frames the exit area)\n* 8 = LIFE token (count lives as the number of 2×2 blocks of 8s)\n* 9 = blue cells (used in player lower body; also appear elsewhere in the map and in key logic)\n* 12 = orange cells (used in player upper body)\n* 15 = MOVE counter (number of 15s ≈ moves/energy left)\n\n# PLAYER (sprite + movement legality)\n* The player is an 8×8 sprite made ONLY of 12s (top two rows) over 9s (bottom six rows).\n  - Concretely: rows 0–1 (relative to the sprite) are all 12s; rows 2–7 are all 9s.\n  - Other scattered 9s on the board are NOT the player—only the exact 8×8 (2×8 of 12s stacked on 6×8 of 9s) is the player.\n* Movement rules:\n  - You may move only through non-4 cells (i.e., never overlap a 4 after a move).\n  - If any part of your 8×8 sprite would overlap a 4 in the target direction (including cases where 4s lie “under” 9s), that move is ILLEGAL.\n  - If your sprite is already touching 4s on a side, you cannot move further in that touching direction until you have clearance.\n  - Practically: navigate corridors “between the 4s”.\n\n# KEYS, EXIT, AND HOW TO FIND THEM\n* The EXIT contains (or is adjacent to) the target key pattern and is marked by nearby 5s (it need not be fully surrounded; any 5s strongly indicate the exit region).\n* The bottom-left of the entire grid shows the REQUIRED KEY BLUEPRINT you must match: a specific layout of 0s (white) and 9s (blue).\n* Key generation mechanism (explicit):\n  - The KEY GENERATOR is a field/patch consisting of 0s and 9s that is NOT surrounded by 5s (i.e., not the exit).\n  - When any part of your 8×8 player walks onto this patch, a NEW candidate key is generated and displayed in the bottom-left.\n  - Step OFF the patch and then back ON to generate yet another candidate key; repeat to cycle through possibilities.\n  - You must keep cycling until the bottom-left candidate key EXACTLY matches the exit’s key (the same distribution of 0s and 9s seen within/adjacent to the 5s).\n* A reliable way to locate both the EXIT and the KEY GENERATOR area:\n  - Look for clusters of 0s and 9s reachable via 3s; if they are NOT framed by 5s, that area is most likely the generator. If you see 5s nearby framing a matching 0/9 pattern, that marks the exit.\n* When the pattern shown in the bottom-left matches the arrangement of 0s and 9s you see framed by (or adjacent to) 5s at the exit, move toward the 5s to complete the level.\n\n# HUD / PROGRESSION\n* Visual score on the second-to-last grid row (row 62): it contains several 4-cell “slots”.\n  - Slots made of 3s represent UNFINISHED levels.\n  - When a slot changes from 3s to another color, that level is COMPLETE.\n* Track remaining MOVES/ENERGY by counting tiles with value 15.\n* Track LIVES by counting distinct 2×2 blocks of 8s.\n\n# GENERAL NOTES\n* The grid is a bird’s-eye view.\n* If the grid does not change after an action, you likely attempted an illegal move into 4s.\n* Favor routes marked by 3s; scan for 0/9 patches (generator) and confirm exit by nearby 5s; confirm the key by matching the bottom-left blueprint of 0s/9s.\n\n# EXAMPLE STRATEGY OBSERVATION\nThe 8×8 player (top rows 12s, bottom rows 9s) is flush against 4s on the left, so LEFT is blocked. I can see a 0/9 patch reachable via 3s to the right (likely the generator) and some 5s beyond it, so I should move RIGHT toward that corridor, cycling the key on the generator until the bottom-left key matches the one at the exit.\n\n# TURN:\nCall exactly one action.\n"

    "content": "\n# CONTEXT:\nYou are an agent playing a dynamic game. Your objective is to\nWIN and avoid GAME_OVER while minimizing actions.\n\nOne action produces one Frame. One Frame is made of one or more sequential\nGrids. Each Grid is a matrix size INT<0,63> by INT<0,63> filled with\nINT<0,15> values. Each value represents a different color and usually implies a different object.\n\nYou are playing a game called LockSmith.\n\n# CONTROLS\n* RESET: start over\n* ACTION1: move up\n* ACTION2: move down\n* ACTION3: move left\n* ACTION4: move right\n* ACTION5/ACTION6: no-ops\n\n# GOAL\nFind/generate a key that MATCHES the key pattern shown at the EXIT, then navigate to the EXIT to finish the level.\nThere are 6 levels total. Complete all levels to WIN.\n\n# TILE MEANINGS (important ones)\n* 0 = white cell (used in key patterns)\n* 3 = walkable path / corridor marker (often outlines routes to key/exit)\n* 4 = WALL (solid). You cannot enter 4s.\n* 5 = EXIT indicator (presence of 5s marks/frames the exit area)\n* 8 = LIFE token (count lives as the number of 2×2 blocks of 8s)\n* 9 = blue cells (used in player lower body; also appear elsewhere in the map and in key logic)\n* 12 = orange cells (used in player upper body)\n* 15 = MOVE counter (number of 15s ≈ moves/energy left)\n\n# PLAYER (sprite + movement legality)\n* The player is an 8×8 sprite made ONLY of 12s (top two rows) over 9s (bottom six rows).\n  - Concretely: rows 0–1 (relative to the sprite) are all 12s; rows 2–7 are all 9s.\n  - Other scattered 9s on the board are NOT the player—only the exact 8×8 (2×8 of 12s stacked on 6×8 of 9s) is the player.\n* Movement rules:\n  - You may move only through non-4 cells (i.e., never overlap a 4 after a move).\n  - If any part of your 8×8 sprite would overlap a 4 in the target direction (including cases where 4s lie “under” 9s), that move is ILLEGAL.\n  - If your sprite is already touching 4s on a side, you cannot move further in that touching direction until you have clearance.\n  - Practically: navigate corridors “between the 4s”.\n\n# KEYS, EXIT, AND HOW TO FIND THEM\n* The EXIT contains (or is adjacent to) the target key pattern and is marked by nearby 5s (it need not be fully surrounded; any 5s strongly indicate the exit region).\n* The bottom-left of the entire grid shows the REQUIRED KEY BLUEPRINT you must match: a specific layout of 0s (white) and 9s (blue).\n* Key generation mechanism (explicit):\n  - The KEY GENERATOR is a field/patch consisting of 0s and 9s that is NOT surrounded by 5s (i.e., not the exit).\n  - When any part of your 8×8 player walks onto this patch, a NEW candidate key is generated and displayed in the bottom-left.\n  - Step OFF the patch and then back ON to generate yet another candidate key; repeat to cycle through possibilities.\n  - You must keep cycling until the bottom-left candidate key EXACTLY matches the exit’s key (the same distribution of 0s and 9s seen within/adjacent to the 5s).\n* A reliable way to locate both the EXIT and the KEY GENERATOR area:\n  - Look for clusters of 0s and 9s reachable via 3s; if they are NOT framed by 5s, that area is most likely the generator. If you see 5s nearby framing a matching 0/9 pattern, that marks the exit.\n* When the pattern shown in the bottom-left matches the arrangement of 0s and 9s you see framed by (or adjacent to) 5s at the exit, move toward the 5s to complete the level.\n\n# HUD / PROGRESSION\n* Visual score on the second-to-last grid row (row 62): it contains several 4-cell “slots”.\n  - Slots made of 3s represent UNFINISHED levels.\n  - When a slot changes from 3s to another color, that level is COMPLETE.\n* Track remaining MOVES/ENERGY by counting tiles with value 15.\n* Track LIVES by counting distinct 2×2 blocks of 8s.\n\n# GENERAL NOTES\n* The grid is a bird’s-eye view.\n* If the grid does not change after an action, you likely attempted an illegal move into 4s.\n* Favor routes marked by 3s; scan for 0/9 patches (generator) and confirm exit by nearby 5s; confirm the key by matching the bottom-left blueprint of 0s/9s.\n\n# EXAMPLE STRATEGY OBSERVATION\nThe 8×8 player (top rows 12s, bottom rows 9s) is flush against 4s on the left, so LEFT is blocked. I can see a 0/9 patch reachable via 3s to the right (likely the generator) and some 5s beyond it, so I should move RIGHT toward that corridor, cycling the key on the generator until the bottom-left key matches the one at the exit.\n\n# TURN:\nCall exactly one action.\n"

    "content": "\n# CONTEXT:\nYou are an agent playing a dynamic game. Your objective is to\nWIN and avoid GAME_OVER while minimizing actions.\n\nOne action produces one Frame. One Frame is made of one or more sequential\nGrids. Each Grid is a matrix size INT<0,63> by INT<0,63> filled with\nINT<0,15> values. Each value represents a different color and usually implies a different object.\n\nYou are playing a game called LockSmith.\n\n# CONTROLS\n* RESET: start over\n* ACTION1: move up\n* ACTION2: move down\n* ACTION3: move left\n* ACTION4: move right\n* ACTION5/ACTION6: no-ops\n\n# GOAL\nFind/generate a key that MATCHES the key pattern shown at the EXIT, then navigate to the EXIT to finish the level.\nThere are 6 levels total. Complete all levels to WIN.\n\n# TILE MEANINGS (important ones)\n* 0 = white cell (used in key patterns)\n* 3 = walkable path / corridor marker (often outlines routes to key/exit)\n* 4 = WALL (solid). You cannot enter 4s.\n* 5 = EXIT indicator (presence of 5s marks/frames the exit area)\n* 8 = LIFE token (count lives as the number of 2×2 blocks of 8s)\n* 9 = blue cells (used in player lower body; also appear elsewhere in the map and in key logic)\n* 12 = orange cells (used in player upper body)\n* 15 = MOVE counter (number of 15s ≈ moves/energy left)\n\n# PLAYER (sprite + movement legality)\n* The player is an 8×8 sprite made ONLY of 12s (top two rows) over 9s (bottom six rows).\n  - Concretely: rows 0–1 (relative to the sprite) are all 12s; rows 2–7 are all 9s.\n  - Other scattered 9s on the board are NOT the player—only the exact 8×8 (2×8 of 12s stacked on 6×8 of 9s) is the player.\n* Movement rules:\n  - You may move only through non-4 cells (i.e., never overlap a 4 after a move).\n  - If any part of your 8×8 sprite would overlap a 4 in the target direction (including cases where 4s lie “under” 9s), that move is ILLEGAL.\n  - If your sprite is already touching 4s on a side, you cannot move further in that touching direction until you have clearance.\n  - Practically: navigate corridors “between the 4s”.\n\n# KEYS, EXIT, AND HOW TO FIND THEM\n* The EXIT contains (or is adjacent to) the target key pattern and is marked by nearby 5s (it need not be fully surrounded; any 5s strongly indicate the exit region).\n* The bottom-left of the entire grid shows the REQUIRED KEY BLUEPRINT you must match: a specific layout of 0s (white) and 9s (blue).\n* Key generation mechanism (explicit):\n  - The KEY GENERATOR is a field/patch consisting of 0s and 9s that is NOT surrounded by 5s (i.e., not the exit).\n  - When any part of your 8×8 player walks onto this patch, a NEW candidate key is generated and displayed in the bottom-left.\n  - Step OFF the patch and then back ON to generate yet another candidate key; repeat to cycle through possibilities.\n  - You must keep cycling until the bottom-left candidate key EXACTLY matches the exit’s key (the same distribution of 0s and 9s seen within/adjacent to the 5s).\n* A reliable way to locate both the EXIT and the KEY GENERATOR area:\n  - Look for clusters of 0s and 9s reachable via 3s; if they are NOT framed by 5s, that area is most likely the generator. If you see 5s nearby framing a matching 0/9 pattern, that marks the exit.\n* When the pattern shown in the bottom-left matches the arrangement of 0s and 9s you see framed by (or adjacent to) 5s at the exit, move toward the 5s to complete the level.\n\n# HUD / PROGRESSION\n* Visual score on the second-to-last grid row (row 62): it contains several 4-cell “slots”.\n  - Slots made of 3s represent UNFINISHED levels.\n  - When a slot changes from 3s to another color, that level is COMPLETE.\n* Track remaining MOVES/ENERGY by counting tiles with value 15.\n* Track LIVES by counting distinct 2×2 blocks of 8s.\n\n# GENERAL NOTES\n* The grid is a bird’s-eye view.\n* If the grid does not change after an action, you likely attempted an illegal move into 4s.\n* Favor routes marked by 3s; scan for 0/9 patches (generator) and confirm exit by nearby 5s; confirm the key by matching the bottom-left blueprint of 0s/9s.\n\n# EXAMPLE STRATEGY OBSERVATION\nThe 8×8 player (top rows 12s, bottom rows 9s) is flush against 4s on the left, so LEFT is blocked. I can see a 0/9 patch reachable via 3s to the right (likely the generator) and some 5s beyond it, so I should move RIGHT toward that corridor, cycling the key on the generator until the bottom-left key matches the one at the exit.\n\n# TURN:\nCall exactly one action.\n"

One Frame is made of one or more sequential\nGrids. Each Grid is a matrix size INT<0,63> by INT<0,63> filled with\nINT<0,15> values. Each value represents a different color and usually implies a different object.\n\nYou are playing a game called LockSmith.\n\n# CONTROLS\n* RESET: start over\n* ACTION1: move up\n* ACTION2: move down\n* ACTION3: move left\n* ACTION4: move right\n* ACTION5/ACTION6: no-ops\n\n# GOAL\nFind/generate a key that MATCHES the key pattern shown at the EXIT, then navigate to the EXIT to finish the level.\nThere are 6 levels total. Complete all levels to WIN.\n\n# TILE MEANINGS (important ones)\n* 0 = white cell (used in key patterns)\n* 3 = walkable path / corridor marker (often outlines routes to key/exit)\n* 4 = WALL (solid). You cannot enter 4s.\n* 5 = EXIT indicator (presence of 5s marks/frames the exit area)\n* 8 = LIFE token (count lives as the number of 2×2 blocks of 8s)\n* 9 = blue cells (used in player lower body; also appear elsewhere in the map and in key logic)\n* 12 = orange cells (used in player upper body)\n* 15 = MOVE counter (number of 15s ≈ moves/energy left)\n\n# PLAYER (sprite + movement legality)\n* The player is an 8×8 sprite made ONLY of 12s (top two rows) over 9s (bottom six rows).\n  - Concretely: rows 0–1 (relative to the sprite) are all 12s; rows 2–7 are all 9s.\n  - Other scattered 9s on the board are NOT the player—only the exact 8×8 (2×8 of 12s stacked on 6×8 of 9s) is the player.\n* Movement rules:\n  - You may move only through non-4 cells (i.e., never overlap a 4 after a move).\n  - If any part of your 8×8 sprite would overlap a 4 in the target direction (including cases where 4s lie “under” 9s), that move is ILLEGAL.\n  - If your sprite is already touching 4s on a side, you cannot move further in that touching direction until you have clearance.\n  - Practically: navigate corridors “between the 4s”.\n\n# KEYS, EXIT, AND HOW TO FIND THEM\n* The EXIT contains (or is adjacent to) the target key pattern and is marked by nearby 5s (it need not be fully surrounded; any 5s strongly indicate the exit region).\n* The bottom-left of the entire grid shows the REQUIRED KEY BLUEPRINT you must match: a specific layout of 0s (white) and 9s (blue).\n* Key generation mechanism (explicit):\n  - The KEY GENERATOR is a field/patch consisting of 0s and 9s that is NOT surrounded by 5s (i.e., not the exit).\n  - When any part of your 8×8 player walks onto this patch, a NEW candidate key is generated and displayed in the bottom-left.\n  - Step OFF the patch and then back ON to generate yet another candidate key; repeat to cycle through possibilities.\n  - You must keep cycling until the bottom-left candidate key EXACTLY matches the exit’s key (the same distribution of 0s and 9s seen within/adjacent to the 5s).\n* A reliable way to locate both the EXIT and the KEY GENERATOR area:\n  - Look for clusters of 0s and 9s reachable via 3s; if they are NOT framed by 5s, that area is most likely the generator. If you see 5s nearby framing a matching 0/9 pattern, that marks the exit.\n* When the pattern shown in the bottom-left matches the arrangement of 0s and 9s you see framed by (or adjacent to) 5s at the exit, move toward the 5s to complete the level.\n\n# HUD / PROGRESSION\n* Visual score on the second-to-last grid row (row 62): it contains several 4-cell “slots”.\n  - Slots made of 3s represent UNFINISHED levels.\n  - When a slot changes from 3s to another color, that level is COMPLETE.\n* Track remaining MOVES/ENERGY by counting tiles with value 15.\n* Track LIVES by counting distinct 2×2 blocks of 8s.\n\n# GENERAL NOTES\n* The grid is a bird’s-eye view.\n* If the grid does not change after an action, you likely attempted an illegal move into 4s.\n* Favor routes marked by 3s; scan for 0/9 patches (generator) and confirm exit by nearby 5s; confirm the key by matching the bottom-left blueprint of 0s/9s.\n\n# EXAMPLE STRATEGY OBSERVATION\nThe 8×8 player (top rows 12s, bottom rows 9s) is flush against 4s on the left, so LEFT is blocked. I can see a 0/9 patch reachable via 3s to the right (likely the generator) and some 5s beyond it, so I should move RIGHT toward that corridor, cycling the key on the generator until the bottom-left key matches the one at the exit.\n\n# TURN:\nCall exactly one action.\n"

You cannot enter 4s.\n* 5 = EXIT indicator (presence of 5s marks/frames the exit area)\n* 8 = LIFE token (count lives as the number of 2×2 blocks of 8s)\n* 9 = blue cells (used in player lower body; also appear elsewhere in the map and in key logic)\n* 12 = orange cells (used in player upper body)\n* 15 = MOVE counter (number of 15s ≈ moves/energy left)\n\n# PLAYER (sprite + movement legality)\n* The player is an 8×8 sprite made ONLY of 12s (top two rows) over 9s (bottom six rows).\n  - Concretely: rows 0–1 (relative to the sprite) are all 12s; rows 2–7 are all 9s.\n  - Other scattered 9s on the board are NOT the player—only the exact 8×8 (2×8 of 12s stacked on 6×8 of 9s) is the player.\n* Movement rules:\n  - You may move only through non-4 cells (i.e., never overlap a 4 after a move).\n  - If any part of your 8×8 sprite would overlap a 4 in the target direction (including cases where 4s lie “under” 9s), that move is ILLEGAL.\n  - If your sprite is already touching 4s on a side, you cannot move further in that touching direction until you have clearance.\n  - Practically: navigate corridors “between the 4s”.\n\n# KEYS, EXIT, AND HOW TO FIND THEM\n* The EXIT contains (or is adjacent to) the target key pattern and is marked by nearby 5s (it need not be fully surrounded; any 5s strongly indicate the exit region).\n* The bottom-left of the entire grid shows the REQUIRED KEY BLUEPRINT you must match: a specific layout of 0s (white) and 9s (blue).\n* Key generation mechanism (explicit):\n  - The KEY GENERATOR is a field/patch consisting of 0s and 9s that is NOT surrounded by 5s (i.e., not the exit).\n  - When any part of your 8×8 player walks onto this patch, a NEW candidate key is generated and displayed in the bottom-left.\n  - Step OFF the patch and then back ON to generate yet another candidate key; repeat to cycle through possibilities.\n  - You must keep cycling until the bottom-left candidate key EXACTLY matches the exit’s key (the same distribution of 0s and 9s seen within/adjacent to the 5s).\n* A reliable way to locate both the EXIT and the KEY GENERATOR area:\n  - Look for clusters of 0s and 9s reachable via 3s; if they are NOT framed by 5s, that area is most likely the generator. If you see 5s nearby framing a matching 0/9 pattern, that marks the exit.\n* When the pattern shown in the bottom-left matches the arrangement of 0s and 9s you see framed by (or adjacent to) 5s at the exit, move toward the 5s to complete the level.\n\n# HUD / PROGRESSION\n* Visual score on the second-to-last grid row (row 62): it contains several 4-cell “slots”.\n  - Slots made of 3s represent UNFINISHED levels.\n  - When a slot changes from 3s to another color, that level is COMPLETE.\n* Track remaining MOVES/ENERGY by counting tiles with value 15.\n* Track LIVES by counting distinct 2×2 blocks of 8s.\n\n# GENERAL NOTES\n* The grid is a bird’s-eye view.\n* If the grid does not change after an action, you likely attempted an illegal move into 4s.\n* Favor routes marked by 3s; scan for 0/9 patches (generator) and confirm exit by nearby 5s; confirm the key by matching the bottom-left blueprint of 0s/9s.\n\n# EXAMPLE STRATEGY OBSERVATION\nThe 8×8 player (top rows 12s, bottom rows 9s) is flush against 4s on the left, so LEFT is blocked. I can see a 0/9 patch reachable via 3s to the right (likely the generator) and some 5s beyond it, so I should move RIGHT toward that corridor, cycling the key on the generator until the bottom-left key matches the one at the exit.\n\n# TURN:\nCall exactly one action.\n"

    "content": "\n# CONTEXT:\nYou are an agent playing a dynamic game. Your objective is to\nWIN and avoid GAME_OVER while minimizing actions.\n\nOne action produces one Frame. One Frame is made of one or more sequential\nGrids. Each Grid is a matrix size INT<0,63> by INT<0,63> filled with\nINT<0,15> values. Each value represents a different color and usually implies a different object.\n\nYou are playing a game called LockSmith.\n\n# CONTROLS\n* RESET: start over\n* ACTION1: move up\n* ACTION2: move down\n* ACTION3: move left\n* ACTION4: move right\n* ACTION5/ACTION6: no-ops\n\n# GOAL\nFind/generate a key that MATCHES the key pattern shown at the EXIT, then navigate to the EXIT to finish the level.\nThere are 6 levels total. Complete all levels to WIN.\n\n# TILE MEANINGS (important ones)\n* 0 = white cell (used in key patterns)\n* 3 = walkable path / corridor marker (often outlines routes to key/exit)\n* 4 = WALL (solid). You cannot enter 4s.\n* 5 = EXIT indicator (presence of 5s marks/frames the exit area)\n* 8 = LIFE token (count lives as the number of 2×2 blocks of 8s)\n* 9 = blue cells (used in player lower body; also appear elsewhere in the map and in key logic)\n* 12 = orange cells (used in player upper body)\n* 15 = MOVE counter (number of 15s ≈ moves/energy left)\n\n# PLAYER (sprite + movement legality)\n* The player is an 8×8 sprite made ONLY of 12s (top two rows) over 9s (bottom six rows).\n  - Concretely: rows 0–1 (relative to the sprite) are all 12s; rows 2–7 are all 9s.\n  - Other scattered 9s on the board are NOT the player—only the exact 8×8 (2×8 of 12s stacked on 6×8 of 9s) is the player.\n* Movement rules:\n  - You may move only through non-4 cells (i.e., never overlap a 4 after a move).\n  - If any part of your 8×8 sprite would overlap a 4 in the target direction (including cases where 4s lie “under” 9s), that move is ILLEGAL.\n  - If your sprite is already touching 4s on a side, you cannot move further in that touching direction until you have clearance.\n  - Practically: navigate corridors “between the 4s”.\n\n# KEYS, EXIT, AND HOW TO FIND THEM\n* The EXIT contains (or is adjacent to) the target key pattern and is marked by nearby 5s (it need not be fully surrounded; any 5s strongly indicate the exit region).\n* The bottom-left of the entire grid shows the REQUIRED KEY BLUEPRINT you must match: a specific layout of 0s (white) and 9s (blue).\n* Key generation mechanism (explicit):\n  - The KEY GENERATOR is a field/patch consisting of 0s and 9s that is NOT surrounded by 5s (i.e., not the exit).\n  - When any part of your 8×8 player walks onto this patch, a NEW candidate key is generated and displayed in the bottom-left.\n  - Step OFF the patch and then back ON to generate yet another candidate key; repeat to cycle through possibilities.\n  - You must keep cycling until the bottom-left candidate key EXACTLY matches the exit’s key (the same distribution of 0s and 9s seen within/adjacent to the 5s).\n* A reliable way to locate both the EXIT and the KEY GENERATOR area:\n  - Look for clusters of 0s and 9s reachable via 3s; if they are NOT framed by 5s, that area is most likely the generator. If you see 5s nearby framing a matching 0/9 pattern, that marks the exit.\n* When the pattern shown in the bottom-left matches the arrangement of 0s and 9s you see framed by (or adjacent to) 5s at the exit, move toward the 5s to complete the level.\n\n# HUD / PROGRESSION\n* Visual score on the second-to-last grid row (row 62): it contains several 4-cell “slots”.\n  - Slots made of 3s represent UNFINISHED levels.\n  - When a slot changes from 3s to another color, that level is COMPLETE.\n* Track remaining MOVES/ENERGY by counting tiles with value 15.\n* Track LIVES by counting distinct 2×2 blocks of 8s.\n\n# GENERAL NOTES\n* The grid is a bird’s-eye view.\n* If the grid does not change after an action, you likely attempted an illegal move into 4s.\n* Favor routes marked by 3s; scan for 0/9 patches (generator) and confirm exit by nearby 5s; confirm the key by matching the bottom-left blueprint of 0s/9s.\n\n# EXAMPLE STRATEGY OBSERVATION\nThe 8×8 player (top rows 12s, bottom rows 9s) is flush against 4s on the left, so LEFT is blocked. I can see a 0/9 patch reachable via 3s to the right (likely the generator) and some 5s beyond it, so I should move RIGHT toward that corridor, cycling the key on the generator until the bottom-left key matches the one at the exit.\n\n# TURN:\nCall exactly one action.\n"

    "content": "\n# CONTEXT:\nYou are an agent playing a dynamic game. Your objective is to\nWIN and avoid GAME_OVER while minimizing actions.\n\nOne action produces one Frame. One Frame is made of one or more sequential\nGrids. Each Grid is a matrix size INT<0,63> by INT<0,63> filled with\nINT<0,15> values. Each value represents a different color and usually implies a different object.\n\nYou are playing a game called LockSmith.\n\n# CONTROLS\n* RESET: start over\n* ACTION1: move up\n* ACTION2: move down\n* ACTION3: move left\n* ACTION4: move right\n* ACTION5/ACTION6: no-ops\n\n# GOAL\nFind/generate a key that MATCHES the key pattern shown at the EXIT, then navigate to the EXIT to finish the level.\nThere are 6 levels total. Complete all levels to WIN.\n\n# TILE MEANINGS (important ones)\n* 0 = white cell (used in key patterns)\n* 3 = walkable path / corridor marker (often outlines routes to key/exit)\n* 4 = WALL (solid). You cannot enter 4s.\n* 5 = EXIT indicator (presence of 5s marks/frames the exit area)\n* 8 = LIFE token (count lives as the number of 2×2 blocks of 8s)\n* 9 = blue cells (used in player lower body; also appear elsewhere in the map and in key logic)\n* 12 = orange cells (used in player upper body)\n* 15 = MOVE counter (number of 15s ≈ moves/energy left)\n\n# PLAYER (sprite + movement legality)\n* The player is an 8×8 sprite made ONLY of 12s (top two rows) over 9s (bottom six rows).\n  - Concretely: rows 0–1 (relative to the sprite) are all 12s; rows 2–7 are all 9s.\n  - Other scattered 9s on the board are NOT the player—only the exact 8×8 (2×8 of 12s stacked on 6×8 of 9s) is the player.\n* Movement rules:\n  - You may move only through non-4 cells (i.e., never overlap a 4 after a move).\n  - If any part of your 8×8 sprite would overlap a 4 in the target direction (including cases where 4s lie “under” 9s), that move is ILLEGAL.\n  - If your sprite is already touching 4s on a side, you cannot move further in that touching direction until you have clearance.\n  - Practically: navigate corridors “between the 4s”.\n\n# KEYS, EXIT, AND HOW TO FIND THEM\n* The EXIT contains (or is adjacent to) the target key pattern and is marked by nearby 5s (it need not be fully surrounded; any 5s strongly indicate the exit region).\n* The bottom-left of the entire grid shows the REQUIRED KEY BLUEPRINT you must match: a specific layout of 0s (white) and 9s (blue).\n* Key generation mechanism (explicit):\n  - The KEY GENERATOR is a field/patch consisting of 0s and 9s that is NOT surrounded by 5s (i.e., not the exit).\n  - When any part of your 8×8 player walks onto this patch, a NEW candidate key is generated and displayed in the bottom-left.\n  - Step OFF the patch and then back ON to generate yet another candidate key; repeat to cycle through possibilities.\n  - You must keep cycling until the bottom-left candidate key EXACTLY matches the exit’s key (the same distribution of 0s and 9s seen within/adjacent to the 5s).\n* A reliable way to locate both the EXIT and the KEY GENERATOR area:\n  - Look for clusters of 0s and 9s reachable via 3s; if they are NOT framed by 5s, that area is most likely the generator. If you see 5s nearby framing a matching 0/9 pattern, that marks the exit.\n* When the pattern shown in the bottom-left matches the arrangement of 0s and 9s you see framed by (or adjacent to) 5s at the exit, move toward the 5s to complete the level.\n\n# HUD / PROGRESSION\n* Visual score on the second-to-last grid row (row 62): it contains several 4-cell “slots”.\n  - Slots made of 3s represent UNFINISHED levels.\n  - When a slot changes from 3s to another color, that level is COMPLETE.\n* Track remaining MOVES/ENERGY by counting tiles with value 15.\n* Track LIVES by counting distinct 2×2 blocks of 8s.\n\n# GENERAL NOTES\n* The grid is a bird’s-eye view.\n* If the grid does not change after an action, you likely attempted an illegal move into 4s.\n* Favor routes marked by 3s; scan for 0/9 patches (generator) and confirm exit by nearby 5s; confirm the key by matching the bottom-left blueprint of 0s/9s.\n\n# EXAMPLE STRATEGY OBSERVATION\nThe 8×8 player (top rows 12s, bottom rows 9s) is flush against 4s on the left, so LEFT is blocked. I can see a 0/9 patch reachable via 3s to the right (likely the generator) and some 5s beyond it, so I should move RIGHT toward that corridor, cycling the key on the generator until the bottom-left key matches the one at the exit.\n\n# TURN:\nCall exactly one action.\n"

    "content": "\n# CONTEXT:\nYou are an agent playing a dynamic game. Your objective is to\nWIN and avoid GAME_OVER while minimizing actions.\n\nOne action produces one Frame. One Frame is made of one or more sequential\nGrids. Each Grid is a matrix size INT<0,63> by INT<0,63> filled with\nINT<0,15> values. Each value represents a different color and usually implies a different object.\n\nYou are playing a game called LockSmith.\n\n# CONTROLS\n* RESET: start over\n* ACTION1: move up\n* ACTION2: move down\n* ACTION3: move left\n* ACTION4: move right\n* ACTION5/ACTION6: no-ops\n\n# GOAL\nFind/generate a key that MATCHES the key pattern shown at the EXIT, then navigate to the EXIT to finish the level.\nThere are 6 levels total. Complete all levels to WIN.\n\n# TILE MEANINGS (important ones)\n* 0 = white cell (used in key patterns)\n* 3 = walkable path / corridor marker (often outlines routes to key/exit)\n* 4 = WALL (solid). You cannot enter 4s.\n* 5 = EXIT indicator (presence of 5s marks/frames the exit area)\n* 8 = LIFE token (count lives as the number of 2×2 blocks of 8s)\n* 9 = blue cells (used in player lower body; also appear elsewhere in the map and in key logic)\n* 12 = orange cells (used in player upper body)\n* 15 = MOVE counter (number of 15s ≈ moves/energy left)\n\n# PLAYER (sprite + movement legality)\n* The player is an 8×8 sprite made ONLY of 12s (top two rows) over 9s (bottom six rows).\n  - Concretely: rows 0–1 (relative to the sprite) are all 12s; rows 2–7 are all 9s.\n  - Other scattered 9s on the board are NOT the player—only the exact 8×8 (2×8 of 12s stacked on 6×8 of 9s) is the player.\n* Movement rules:\n  - You may move only through non-4 cells (i.e., never overlap a 4 after a move).\n  - If any part of your 8×8 sprite would overlap a 4 in the target direction (including cases where 4s lie “under” 9s), that move is ILLEGAL.\n  - If your sprite is already touching 4s on a side, you cannot move further in that touching direction until you have clearance.\n  - Practically: navigate corridors “between the 4s”.\n\n# KEYS, EXIT, AND HOW TO FIND THEM\n* The EXIT contains (or is adjacent to) the target key pattern and is marked by nearby 5s (it need not be fully surrounded; any 5s strongly indicate the exit region).\n* The bottom-left of the entire grid shows the REQUIRED KEY BLUEPRINT you must match: a specific layout of 0s (white) and 9s (blue).\n* Key generation mechanism (explicit):\n  - The KEY GENERATOR is a field/patch consisting of 0s and 9s that is NOT surrounded by 5s (i.e., not the exit).\n  - When any part of your 8×8 player walks onto this patch, a NEW candidate key is generated and displayed in the bottom-left.\n  - Step OFF the patch and then back ON to generate yet another candidate key; repeat to cycle through possibilities.\n  - You must keep cycling until the bottom-left candidate key EXACTLY matches the exit’s key (the same distribution of 0s and 9s seen within/adjacent to the 5s).\n* A reliable way to locate both the EXIT and the KEY GENERATOR area:\n  - Look for clusters of 0s and 9s reachable via 3s; if they are NOT framed by 5s, that area is most likely the generator. If you see 5s nearby framing a matching 0/9 pattern, that marks the exit.\n* When the pattern shown in the bottom-left matches the arrangement of 0s and 9s you see framed by (or adjacent to) 5s at the exit, move toward the 5s to complete the level.\n\n# HUD / PROGRESSION\n* Visual score on the second-to-last grid row (row 62): it contains several 4-cell “slots”.\n  - Slots made of 3s represent UNFINISHED levels.\n  - When a slot changes from 3s to another color, that level is COMPLETE.\n* Track remaining MOVES/ENERGY by counting tiles with value 15.\n* Track LIVES by counting distinct 2×2 blocks of 8s.\n\n# GENERAL NOTES\n* The grid is a bird’s-eye view.\n* If the grid does not change after an action, you likely attempted an illegal move into 4s.\n* Favor routes marked by 3s; scan for 0/9 patches (generator) and confirm exit by nearby 5s; confirm the key by matching the bottom-left blueprint of 0s/9s.\n\n# EXAMPLE STRATEGY OBSERVATION\nThe 8×8 player (top rows 12s, bottom rows 9s) is flush against 4s on the left, so LEFT is blocked. I can see a 0/9 patch reachable via 3s to the right (likely the generator) and some 5s beyond it, so I should move RIGHT toward that corridor, cycling the key on the generator until the bottom-left key matches the one at the exit.\n\n# TURN:\nCall exactly one action.\n"
