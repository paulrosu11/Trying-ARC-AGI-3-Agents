One Frame is made of one or more sequential\nGrids. Each Grid is a matrix size INT<0,63> by INT<0,63> filled with\nINT<0,15> values. Each value represents a different color and usually implies a different object.\n\nYou are playing a game called LockSmith.\n\n# CONTROLS\n* RESET: start over\n* ACTION1: move up\n* ACTION2: move down\n* ACTION3: move left\n* ACTION4: move right\n* ACTION5/ACTION6: no-ops\n\n# GOAL\nFind/generate a key that MATCHES the key pattern shown at the EXIT, then navigate to the EXIT to finish the level.\nThere are 6 levels total. Complete all levels to WIN.\n\n# TILE MEANINGS (important ones)\n* 0 = white cell (used in key patterns)\n* 3 = walkable path / corridor marker (often outlines routes to key/exit)\n* 4 = WALL (solid). You cannot enter 4s.\n* 5 = EXIT indicator (presence of 5s marks/frames the exit area)\n* 8 = LIFE token (count lives as the number of 2×2 blocks of 8s)\n* 9 = blue cells (used in player lower body; also appear elsewhere in the map and in key logic)\n* 12 = orange cells (used in player upper body)\n* 15 = MOVE counter (number of 15s ≈ moves/energy left)\n\n# PLAYER (sprite + movement legality)\n* The player is an 8×8 sprite made ONLY of 12s (top two rows) over 9s (bottom six rows).\n  - Concretely: rows 0–1 (relative to the sprite) are all 12s; rows 2–7 are all 9s.\n  - Other scattered 9s on the board are NOT the player—only the exact 8×8 (2×8 of 12s stacked on 6×8 of 9s) is the player.\n* Movement rules:\n  - You may move only through non-4 cells (i.e., never overlap a 4 after a move).\n  - If any part of your 8×8 sprite would overlap a 4 in the target direction (including cases where 4s lie “under” 9s), that move is ILLEGAL.\n  - If your sprite is already touching 4s on a side, you cannot move further in that touching direction until you have clearance.\n  - Practically: navigate corridors “between the 4s”.\n\n# KEYS, EXIT, AND HOW TO FIND THEM\n* The EXIT contains (or is adjacent to) the target key pattern and is marked by nearby 5s (it need not be fully surrounded; any 5s strongly indicate the exit region).\n* The bottom-left of the entire grid shows the REQUIRED KEY BLUEPRINT you must match: a specific layout of 0s (white) and 9s (blue).\n* Key generation mechanism (explicit):\n  - The KEY GENERATOR is a field/patch consisting of 0s and 9s that is NOT surrounded by 5s (i.e., not the exit).\n  - When any part of your 8×8 player walks onto this patch, a NEW candidate key is generated and displayed in the bottom-left.\n  - Step OFF the patch and then back ON to generate yet another candidate key; repeat to cycle through possibilities.\n  - You must keep cycling until the bottom-left candidate key EXACTLY matches the exit’s key (the same distribution of 0s and 9s seen within/adjacent to the 5s).\n* A reliable way to locate both the EXIT and the KEY GENERATOR area:\n  - Look for clusters of 0s and 9s reachable via 3s; if they are NOT framed by 5s, that area is most likely the generator. If you see 5s nearby framing a matching 0/9 pattern, that marks the exit.\n* When the pattern shown in the bottom-left matches the arrangement of 0s and 9s you see framed by (or adjacent to) 5s at the exit, move toward the 5s to complete the level.\n\n# HUD / PROGRESSION\n* Visual score on the second-to-last grid row (row 62): it contains several 4-cell “slots”.\n  - Slots made of 3s represent UNFINISHED levels.\n  - When a slot changes from 3s to another color, that level is COMPLETE.\n* Track remaining MOVES/ENERGY by counting tiles with value 15.\n* Track LIVES by counting distinct 2×2 blocks of 8s.\n\n# GENERAL NOTES\n* The grid is a bird’s-eye view.\n* If the grid does not change after an action, you likely attempted an illegal move into 4s.\n* Favor routes marked by 3s; scan for 0/9 patches (generator) and confirm exit by nearby 5s; confirm the key by matching the bottom-left blueprint of 0s/9s.\n\n# EXAMPLE STRATEGY OBSERVATION\nThe 8×8 player (top rows 12s, bottom rows 9s) is flush against 4s on the left, so LEFT is blocked. I can see a 0/9 patch reachable via 3s to the right (likely the generator) and some 5s beyond it, so I should move RIGHT toward that corridor, cycling the key on the generator until the bottom-left key matches the one at the exit.\n\n# TURN:\nCall exactly one action.\n"

There’s a clear corridor of 3s above and to the right leading into the map; the EXIT region (clustered 5s with a 0/9 key pattern) is visible up and slightly left from the mid-top. Plan: move into the 3-tiled corridor to reach the map interior, find the 0/9 key-generator patch (a patch of 0s/9s not framed by 5s), step on/off it to cycle candidate keys until the bottom-left blueprint matches the exit’s pattern, then navigate to the 5s to finish the level. I’ll start by moving up into the corridor."

    "content": "\n# CONTEXT:\nYou are an agent playing a dynamic game. Your objective is to\nWIN and avoid GAME_OVER while minimizing actions.\n\nOne action produces one Frame. One Frame is made of one or more sequential\nGrids. Each Grid is a matrix size INT<0,63> by INT<0,63> filled with\nINT<0,15> values. Each value represents a different color and usually implies a different object.\n\nYou are playing a game called LockSmith.\n\n# CONTROLS\n* RESET: start over\n* ACTION1: move up\n* ACTION2: move down\n* ACTION3: move left\n* ACTION4: move right\n* ACTION5/ACTION6: no-ops\n\n# GOAL\nFind/generate a key that MATCHES the key pattern shown at the EXIT, then navigate to the EXIT to finish the level.\nThere are 6 levels total. Complete all levels to WIN.\n\n# TILE MEANINGS (important ones)\n* 0 = white cell (used in key patterns)\n* 3 = walkable path / corridor marker (often outlines routes to key/exit)\n* 4 = WALL (solid). You cannot enter 4s.\n* 5 = EXIT indicator (presence of 5s marks/frames the exit area)\n* 8 = LIFE token (count lives as the number of 2×2 blocks of 8s)\n* 9 = blue cells (used in player lower body; also appear elsewhere in the map and in key logic)\n* 12 = orange cells (used in player upper body)\n* 15 = MOVE counter (number of 15s ≈ moves/energy left)\n\n# PLAYER (sprite + movement legality)\n* The player is an 8×8 sprite made ONLY of 12s (top two rows) over 9s (bottom six rows).\n  - Concretely: rows 0–1 (relative to the sprite) are all 12s; rows 2–7 are all 9s.\n  - Other scattered 9s on the board are NOT the player—only the exact 8×8 (2×8 of 12s stacked on 6×8 of 9s) is the player.\n* Movement rules:\n  - You may move only through non-4 cells (i.e., never overlap a 4 after a move).\n  - If any part of your 8×8 sprite would overlap a 4 in the target direction (including cases where 4s lie “under” 9s), that move is ILLEGAL.\n  - If your sprite is already touching 4s on a side, you cannot move further in that touching direction until you have clearance.\n  - Practically: navigate corridors “between the 4s”.\n\n# KEYS, EXIT, AND HOW TO FIND THEM\n* The EXIT contains (or is adjacent to) the target key pattern and is marked by nearby 5s (it need not be fully surrounded; any 5s strongly indicate the exit region).\n* The bottom-left of the entire grid shows the REQUIRED KEY BLUEPRINT you must match: a specific layout of 0s (white) and 9s (blue).\n* Key generation mechanism (explicit):\n  - The KEY GENERATOR is a field/patch consisting of 0s and 9s that is NOT surrounded by 5s (i.e., not the exit).\n  - When any part of your 8×8 player walks onto this patch, a NEW candidate key is generated and displayed in the bottom-left.\n  - Step OFF the patch and then back ON to generate yet another candidate key; repeat to cycle through possibilities.\n  - You must keep cycling until the bottom-left candidate key EXACTLY matches the exit’s key (the same distribution of 0s and 9s seen within/adjacent to the 5s).\n* A reliable way to locate both the EXIT and the KEY GENERATOR area:\n  - Look for clusters of 0s and 9s reachable via 3s; if they are NOT framed by 5s, that area is most likely the generator. If you see 5s nearby framing a matching 0/9 pattern, that marks the exit.\n* When the pattern shown in the bottom-left matches the arrangement of 0s and 9s you see framed by (or adjacent to) 5s at the exit, move toward the 5s to complete the level.\n\n# HUD / PROGRESSION\n* Visual score on the second-to-last grid row (row 62): it contains several 4-cell “slots”.\n  - Slots made of 3s represent UNFINISHED levels.\n  - When a slot changes from 3s to another color, that level is COMPLETE.\n* Track remaining MOVES/ENERGY by counting tiles with value 15.\n* Track LIVES by counting distinct 2×2 blocks of 8s.\n\n# GENERAL NOTES\n* The grid is a bird’s-eye view.\n* If the grid does not change after an action, you likely attempted an illegal move into 4s.\n* Favor routes marked by 3s; scan for 0/9 patches (generator) and confirm exit by nearby 5s; confirm the key by matching the bottom-left blueprint of 0s/9s.\n\n# EXAMPLE STRATEGY OBSERVATION\nThe 8×8 player (top rows 12s, bottom rows 9s) is flush against 4s on the left, so LEFT is blocked. I can see a 0/9 patch reachable via 3s to the right (likely the generator) and some 5s beyond it, so I should move RIGHT toward that corridor, cycling the key on the generator until the bottom-left key matches the one at the exit.\n\n# TURN:\nCall exactly one action.\n"

Plan: move into the 3-tiled corridor to reach the map interior, find the 0/9 key-generator patch (a patch of 0s/9s not framed by 5s), step on/off it to cycle candidate keys until the bottom-left blueprint matches the exit’s pattern, then navigate to the 5s to finish the level.

    "content": "\n# CONTEXT:\nYou are an agent playing a dynamic game. Your objective is to\nWIN and avoid GAME_OVER while minimizing actions.\n\nOne action produces one Frame. One Frame is made of one or more sequential\nGrids. Each Grid is a matrix size INT<0,63> by INT<0,63> filled with\nINT<0,15> values. Each value represents a different color and usually implies a different object.\n\nYou are playing a game called LockSmith.\n\n# CONTROLS\n* RESET: start over\n* ACTION1: move up\n* ACTION2: move down\n* ACTION3: move left\n* ACTION4: move right\n* ACTION5/ACTION6: no-ops\n\n# GOAL\nFind/generate a key that MATCHES the key pattern shown at the EXIT, then navigate to the EXIT to finish the level.\nThere are 6 levels total. Complete all levels to WIN.\n\n# TILE MEANINGS (important ones)\n* 0 = white cell (used in key patterns)\n* 3 = walkable path / corridor marker (often outlines routes to key/exit)\n* 4 = WALL (solid).

There’s a clear corridor of 3s above and to the right leading into the map; the EXIT region (clustered 5s with a 0/9 key pattern) is visible up and slightly left from the mid-top. Plan: move into the 3-tiled corridor to reach the map interior, find the 0/9 key-generator patch (a patch of 0s/9s not framed by 5s), step on/off it to cycle candidate keys until the bottom-left blueprint matches the exit’s pattern, then navigate to the 5s to finish the level. I’ll start by moving up into the corridor."

    "content": "\n# CONTEXT:\nYou are an agent playing a dynamic game. Your objective is to\nWIN and avoid GAME_OVER while minimizing actions.\n\nOne action produces one Frame. One Frame is made of one or more sequential\nGrids. Each Grid is a matrix size INT<0,63> by INT<0,63> filled with\nINT<0,15> values. Each value represents a different color and usually implies a different object.\n\nYou are playing a game called LockSmith.\n\n# CONTROLS\n* RESET: start over\n* ACTION1: move up\n* ACTION2: move down\n* ACTION3: move left\n* ACTION4: move right\n* ACTION5/ACTION6: no-ops\n\n# GOAL\nFind/generate a key that MATCHES the key pattern shown at the EXIT, then navigate to the EXIT to finish the level.\nThere are 6 levels total. Complete all levels to WIN.\n\n# TILE MEANINGS (important ones)\n* 0 = white cell (used in key patterns)\n* 3 = walkable path / corridor marker (often outlines routes to key/exit)\n* 4 = WALL (solid). You cannot enter 4s.\n* 5 = EXIT indicator (presence of 5s marks/frames the exit area)\n* 8 = LIFE token (count lives as the number of 2×2 blocks of 8s)\n* 9 = blue cells (used in player lower body; also appear elsewhere in the map and in key logic)\n* 12 = orange cells (used in player upper body)\n* 15 = MOVE counter (number of 15s ≈ moves/energy left)\n\n# PLAYER (sprite + movement legality)\n* The player is an 8×8 sprite made ONLY of 12s (top two rows) over 9s (bottom six rows).\n  - Concretely: rows 0–1 (relative to the sprite) are all 12s; rows 2–7 are all 9s.\n  - Other scattered 9s on the board are NOT the player—only the exact 8×8 (2×8 of 12s stacked on 6×8 of 9s) is the player.\n* Movement rules:\n  - You may move only through non-4 cells (i.e., never overlap a 4 after a move).\n  - If any part of your 8×8 sprite would overlap a 4 in the target direction (including cases where 4s lie “under” 9s), that move is ILLEGAL.\n  - If your sprite is already touching 4s on a side, you cannot move further in that touching direction until you have clearance.\n  - Practically: navigate corridors “between the 4s”.\n\n# KEYS, EXIT, AND HOW TO FIND THEM\n* The EXIT contains (or is adjacent to) the target key pattern and is marked by nearby 5s (it need not be fully surrounded; any 5s strongly indicate the exit region).\n* The bottom-left of the entire grid shows the REQUIRED KEY BLUEPRINT you must match: a specific layout of 0s (white) and 9s (blue).\n* Key generation mechanism (explicit):\n  - The KEY GENERATOR is a field/patch consisting of 0s and 9s that is NOT surrounded by 5s (i.e., not the exit).\n  - When any part of your 8×8 player walks onto this patch, a NEW candidate key is generated and displayed in the bottom-left.\n  - Step OFF the patch and then back ON to generate yet another candidate key; repeat to cycle through possibilities.\n  - You must keep cycling until the bottom-left candidate key EXACTLY matches the exit’s key (the same distribution of 0s and 9s seen within/adjacent to the 5s).\n* A reliable way to locate both the EXIT and the KEY GENERATOR area:\n  - Look for clusters of 0s and 9s reachable via 3s; if they are NOT framed by 5s, that area is most likely the generator. If you see 5s nearby framing a matching 0/9 pattern, that marks the exit.\n* When the pattern shown in the bottom-left matches the arrangement of 0s and 9s you see framed by (or adjacent to) 5s at the exit, move toward the 5s to complete the level.\n\n# HUD / PROGRESSION\n* Visual score on the second-to-last grid row (row 62): it contains several 4-cell “slots”.\n  - Slots made of 3s represent UNFINISHED levels.\n  - When a slot changes from 3s to another color, that level is COMPLETE.\n* Track remaining MOVES/ENERGY by counting tiles with value 15.\n* Track LIVES by counting distinct 2×2 blocks of 8s.\n\n# GENERAL NOTES\n* The grid is a bird’s-eye view.\n* If the grid does not change after an action, you likely attempted an illegal move into 4s.\n* Favor routes marked by 3s; scan for 0/9 patches (generator) and confirm exit by nearby 5s; confirm the key by matching the bottom-left blueprint of 0s/9s.\n\n# EXAMPLE STRATEGY OBSERVATION\nThe 8×8 player (top rows 12s, bottom rows 9s) is flush against 4s on the left, so LEFT is blocked. I can see a 0/9 patch reachable via 3s to the right (likely the generator) and some 5s beyond it, so I should move RIGHT toward that corridor, cycling the key on the generator until the bottom-left key matches the one at the exit.\n\n# TURN:\nCall exactly one action.\n"

    "content": "\n# CONTEXT:\nYou are an agent playing a dynamic game. Your objective is to\nWIN and avoid GAME_OVER while minimizing actions.\n\nOne action produces one Frame. One Frame is made of one or more sequential\nGrids. Each Grid is a matrix size INT<0,63> by INT<0,63> filled with\nINT<0,15> values. Each value represents a different color and usually implies a different object.\n\nYou are playing a game called LockSmith.\n\n# CONTROLS\n* RESET: start over\n* ACTION1: move up\n* ACTION2: move down\n* ACTION3: move left\n* ACTION4: move right\n* ACTION5/ACTION6: no-ops\n\n# GOAL\nFind/generate a key that MATCHES the key pattern shown at the EXIT, then navigate to the EXIT to finish the level.\nThere are 6 levels total. Complete all levels to WIN.\n\n# TILE MEANINGS (important ones)\n* 0 = white cell (used in key patterns)\n* 3 = walkable path / corridor marker (often outlines routes to key/exit)\n* 4 = WALL (solid). You cannot enter 4s.\n* 5 = EXIT indicator (presence of 5s marks/frames the exit area)\n* 8 = LIFE token (count lives as the number of 2×2 blocks of 8s)\n* 9 = blue cells (used in player lower body; also appear elsewhere in the map and in key logic)\n* 12 = orange cells (used in player upper body)\n* 15 = MOVE counter (number of 15s ≈ moves/energy left)\n\n# PLAYER (sprite + movement legality)\n* The player is an 8×8 sprite made ONLY of 12s (top two rows) over 9s (bottom six rows).\n  - Concretely: rows 0–1 (relative to the sprite) are all 12s; rows 2–7 are all 9s.\n  - Other scattered 9s on the board are NOT the player—only the exact 8×8 (2×8 of 12s stacked on 6×8 of 9s) is the player.\n* Movement rules:\n  - You may move only through non-4 cells (i.e., never overlap a 4 after a move).\n  - If any part of your 8×8 sprite would overlap a 4 in the target direction (including cases where 4s lie “under” 9s), that move is ILLEGAL.\n  - If your sprite is already touching 4s on a side, you cannot move further in that touching direction until you have clearance.\n  - Practically: navigate corridors “between the 4s”.\n\n# KEYS, EXIT, AND HOW TO FIND THEM\n* The EXIT contains (or is adjacent to) the target key pattern and is marked by nearby 5s (it need not be fully surrounded; any 5s strongly indicate the exit region).\n* The bottom-left of the entire grid shows the REQUIRED KEY BLUEPRINT you must match: a specific layout of 0s (white) and 9s (blue).\n* Key generation mechanism (explicit):\n  - The KEY GENERATOR is a field/patch consisting of 0s and 9s that is NOT surrounded by 5s (i.e., not the exit).\n  - When any part of your 8×8 player walks onto this patch, a NEW candidate key is generated and displayed in the bottom-left.\n  - Step OFF the patch and then back ON to generate yet another candidate key; repeat to cycle through possibilities.\n  - You must keep cycling until the bottom-left candidate key EXACTLY matches the exit’s key (the same distribution of 0s and 9s seen within/adjacent to the 5s).\n* A reliable way to locate both the EXIT and the KEY GENERATOR area:\n  - Look for clusters of 0s and 9s reachable via 3s; if they are NOT framed by 5s, that area is most likely the generator. If you see 5s nearby framing a matching 0/9 pattern, that marks the exit.\n* When the pattern shown in the bottom-left matches the arrangement of 0s and 9s you see framed by (or adjacent to) 5s at the exit, move toward the 5s to complete the level.\n\n# HUD / PROGRESSION\n* Visual score on the second-to-last grid row (row 62): it contains several 4-cell “slots”.\n  - Slots made of 3s represent UNFINISHED levels.\n  - When a slot changes from 3s to another color, that level is COMPLETE.\n* Track remaining MOVES/ENERGY by counting tiles with value 15.\n* Track LIVES by counting distinct 2×2 blocks of 8s.\n\n# GENERAL NOTES\n* The grid is a bird’s-eye view.\n* If the grid does not change after an action, you likely attempted an illegal move into 4s.\n* Favor routes marked by 3s; scan for 0/9 patches (generator) and confirm exit by nearby 5s; confirm the key by matching the bottom-left blueprint of 0s/9s.\n\n# EXAMPLE STRATEGY OBSERVATION\nThe 8×8 player (top rows 12s, bottom rows 9s) is flush against 4s on the left, so LEFT is blocked. I can see a 0/9 patch reachable via 3s to the right (likely the generator) and some 5s beyond it, so I should move RIGHT toward that corridor, cycling the key on the generator until the bottom-left key matches the one at the exit.\n\n# TURN:\nCall exactly one action.\n"

    "content": "\n# CONTEXT:\nYou are an agent playing a dynamic game. Your objective is to\nWIN and avoid GAME_OVER while minimizing actions.\n\nOne action produces one Frame. One Frame is made of one or more sequential\nGrids. Each Grid is a matrix size INT<0,63> by INT<0,63> filled with\nINT<0,15> values. Each value represents a different color and usually implies a different object.\n\nYou are playing a game called LockSmith.\n\n# CONTROLS\n* RESET: start over\n* ACTION1: move up\n* ACTION2: move down\n* ACTION3: move left\n* ACTION4: move right\n* ACTION5/ACTION6: no-ops\n\n# GOAL\nFind/generate a key that MATCHES the key pattern shown at the EXIT, then navigate to the EXIT to finish the level.\nThere are 6 levels total. Complete all levels to WIN.\n\n# TILE MEANINGS (important ones)\n* 0 = white cell (used in key patterns)\n* 3 = walkable path / corridor marker (often outlines routes to key/exit)\n* 4 = WALL (solid). You cannot enter 4s.\n* 5 = EXIT indicator (presence of 5s marks/frames the exit area)\n* 8 = LIFE token (count lives as the number of 2×2 blocks of 8s)\n* 9 = blue cells (used in player lower body; also appear elsewhere in the map and in key logic)\n* 12 = orange cells (used in player upper body)\n* 15 = MOVE counter (number of 15s ≈ moves/energy left)\n\n# PLAYER (sprite + movement legality)\n* The player is an 8×8 sprite made ONLY of 12s (top two rows) over 9s (bottom six rows).\n  - Concretely: rows 0–1 (relative to the sprite) are all 12s; rows 2–7 are all 9s.\n  - Other scattered 9s on the board are NOT the player—only the exact 8×8 (2×8 of 12s stacked on 6×8 of 9s) is the player.\n* Movement rules:\n  - You may move only through non-4 cells (i.e., never overlap a 4 after a move).\n  - If any part of your 8×8 sprite would overlap a 4 in the target direction (including cases where 4s lie “under” 9s), that move is ILLEGAL.\n  - If your sprite is already touching 4s on a side, you cannot move further in that touching direction until you have clearance.\n  - Practically: navigate corridors “between the 4s”.\n\n# KEYS, EXIT, AND HOW TO FIND THEM\n* The EXIT contains (or is adjacent to) the target key pattern and is marked by nearby 5s (it need not be fully surrounded; any 5s strongly indicate the exit region).\n* The bottom-left of the entire grid shows the REQUIRED KEY BLUEPRINT you must match: a specific layout of 0s (white) and 9s (blue).\n* Key generation mechanism (explicit):\n  - The KEY GENERATOR is a field/patch consisting of 0s and 9s that is NOT surrounded by 5s (i.e., not the exit).\n  - When any part of your 8×8 player walks onto this patch, a NEW candidate key is generated and displayed in the bottom-left.\n  - Step OFF the patch and then back ON to generate yet another candidate key; repeat to cycle through possibilities.\n  - You must keep cycling until the bottom-left candidate key EXACTLY matches the exit’s key (the same distribution of 0s and 9s seen within/adjacent to the 5s).\n* A reliable way to locate both the EXIT and the KEY GENERATOR area:\n  - Look for clusters of 0s and 9s reachable via 3s; if they are NOT framed by 5s, that area is most likely the generator. If you see 5s nearby framing a matching 0/9 pattern, that marks the exit.\n* When the pattern shown in the bottom-left matches the arrangement of 0s and 9s you see framed by (or adjacent to) 5s at the exit, move toward the 5s to complete the level.\n\n# HUD / PROGRESSION\n* Visual score on the second-to-last grid row (row 62): it contains several 4-cell “slots”.\n  - Slots made of 3s represent UNFINISHED levels.\n  - When a slot changes from 3s to another color, that level is COMPLETE.\n* Track remaining MOVES/ENERGY by counting tiles with value 15.\n* Track LIVES by counting distinct 2×2 blocks of 8s.\n\n# GENERAL NOTES\n* The grid is a bird’s-eye view.\n* If the grid does not change after an action, you likely attempted an illegal move into 4s.\n* Favor routes marked by 3s; scan for 0/9 patches (generator) and confirm exit by nearby 5s; confirm the key by matching the bottom-left blueprint of 0s/9s.\n\n# EXAMPLE STRATEGY OBSERVATION\nThe 8×8 player (top rows 12s, bottom rows 9s) is flush against 4s on the left, so LEFT is blocked. I can see a 0/9 patch reachable via 3s to the right (likely the generator) and some 5s beyond it, so I should move RIGHT toward that corridor, cycling the key on the generator until the bottom-left key matches the one at the exit.\n\n# TURN:\nCall exactly one action.\n"

    "content": "\n# CONTEXT:\nYou are an agent playing a dynamic game. Your objective is to\nWIN and avoid GAME_OVER while minimizing actions.\n\nOne action produces one Frame. One Frame is made of one or more sequential\nGrids. Each Grid is a matrix size INT<0,63> by INT<0,63> filled with\nINT<0,15> values. Each value represents a different color and usually implies a different object.\n\nYou are playing a game called LockSmith.\n\n# CONTROLS\n* RESET: start over\n* ACTION1: move up\n* ACTION2: move down\n* ACTION3: move left\n* ACTION4: move right\n* ACTION5/ACTION6: no-ops\n\n# GOAL\nFind/generate a key that MATCHES the key pattern shown at the EXIT, then navigate to the EXIT to finish the level.\nThere are 6 levels total. Complete all levels to WIN.\n\n# TILE MEANINGS (important ones)\n* 0 = white cell (used in key patterns)\n* 3 = walkable path / corridor marker (often outlines routes to key/exit)\n* 4 = WALL (solid). You cannot enter 4s.\n* 5 = EXIT indicator (presence of 5s marks/frames the exit area)\n* 8 = LIFE token (count lives as the number of 2×2 blocks of 8s)\n* 9 = blue cells (used in player lower body; also appear elsewhere in the map and in key logic)\n* 12 = orange cells (used in player upper body)\n* 15 = MOVE counter (number of 15s ≈ moves/energy left)\n\n# PLAYER (sprite + movement legality)\n* The player is an 8×8 sprite made ONLY of 12s (top two rows) over 9s (bottom six rows).\n  - Concretely: rows 0–1 (relative to the sprite) are all 12s; rows 2–7 are all 9s.\n  - Other scattered 9s on the board are NOT the player—only the exact 8×8 (2×8 of 12s stacked on 6×8 of 9s) is the player.\n* Movement rules:\n  - You may move only through non-4 cells (i.e., never overlap a 4 after a move).\n  - If any part of your 8×8 sprite would overlap a 4 in the target direction (including cases where 4s lie “under” 9s), that move is ILLEGAL.\n  - If your sprite is already touching 4s on a side, you cannot move further in that touching direction until you have clearance.\n  - Practically: navigate corridors “between the 4s”.\n\n# KEYS, EXIT, AND HOW TO FIND THEM\n* The EXIT contains (or is adjacent to) the target key pattern and is marked by nearby 5s (it need not be fully surrounded; any 5s strongly indicate the exit region).\n* The bottom-left of the entire grid shows the REQUIRED KEY BLUEPRINT you must match: a specific layout of 0s (white) and 9s (blue).\n* Key generation mechanism (explicit):\n  - The KEY GENERATOR is a field/patch consisting of 0s and 9s that is NOT surrounded by 5s (i.e., not the exit).\n  - When any part of your 8×8 player walks onto this patch, a NEW candidate key is generated and displayed in the bottom-left.\n  - Step OFF the patch and then back ON to generate yet another candidate key; repeat to cycle through possibilities.\n  - You must keep cycling until the bottom-left candidate key EXACTLY matches the exit’s key (the same distribution of 0s and 9s seen within/adjacent to the 5s).\n* A reliable way to locate both the EXIT and the KEY GENERATOR area:\n  - Look for clusters of 0s and 9s reachable via 3s; if they are NOT framed by 5s, that area is most likely the generator. If you see 5s nearby framing a matching 0/9 pattern, that marks the exit.\n* When the pattern shown in the bottom-left matches the arrangement of 0s and 9s you see framed by (or adjacent to) 5s at the exit, move toward the 5s to complete the level.\n\n# HUD / PROGRESSION\n* Visual score on the second-to-last grid row (row 62): it contains several 4-cell “slots”.\n  - Slots made of 3s represent UNFINISHED levels.\n  - When a slot changes from 3s to another color, that level is COMPLETE.\n* Track remaining MOVES/ENERGY by counting tiles with value 15.\n* Track LIVES by counting distinct 2×2 blocks of 8s.\n\n# GENERAL NOTES\n* The grid is a bird’s-eye view.\n* If the grid does not change after an action, you likely attempted an illegal move into 4s.\n* Favor routes marked by 3s; scan for 0/9 patches (generator) and confirm exit by nearby 5s; confirm the key by matching the bottom-left blueprint of 0s/9s.\n\n# EXAMPLE STRATEGY OBSERVATION\nThe 8×8 player (top rows 12s, bottom rows 9s) is flush against 4s on the left, so LEFT is blocked. I can see a 0/9 patch reachable via 3s to the right (likely the generator) and some 5s beyond it, so I should move RIGHT toward that corridor, cycling the key on the generator until the bottom-left key matches the one at the exit.\n\n# TURN:\nCall exactly one action.\n"

    "content": "\n# CONTEXT:\nYou are an agent playing a dynamic game. Your objective is to\nWIN and avoid GAME_OVER while minimizing actions.\n\nOne action produces one Frame. One Frame is made of one or more sequential\nGrids. Each Grid is a matrix size INT<0,63> by INT<0,63> filled with\nINT<0,15> values. Each value represents a different color and usually implies a different object.\n\nYou are playing a game called LockSmith.\n\n# CONTROLS\n* RESET: start over\n* ACTION1: move up\n* ACTION2: move down\n* ACTION3: move left\n* ACTION4: move right\n* ACTION5/ACTION6: no-ops\n\n# GOAL\nFind/generate a key that MATCHES the key pattern shown at the EXIT, then navigate to the EXIT to finish the level.\nThere are 6 levels total. Complete all levels to WIN.\n\n# TILE MEANINGS (important ones)\n* 0 = white cell (used in key patterns)\n* 3 = walkable path / corridor marker (often outlines routes to key/exit)\n* 4 = WALL (solid). You cannot enter 4s.\n* 5 = EXIT indicator (presence of 5s marks/frames the exit area)\n* 8 = LIFE token (count lives as the number of 2×2 blocks of 8s)\n* 9 = blue cells (used in player lower body; also appear elsewhere in the map and in key logic)\n* 12 = orange cells (used in player upper body)\n* 15 = MOVE counter (number of 15s ≈ moves/energy left)\n\n# PLAYER (sprite + movement legality)\n* The player is an 8×8 sprite made ONLY of 12s (top two rows) over 9s (bottom six rows).\n  - Concretely: rows 0–1 (relative to the sprite) are all 12s; rows 2–7 are all 9s.\n  - Other scattered 9s on the board are NOT the player—only the exact 8×8 (2×8 of 12s stacked on 6×8 of 9s) is the player.\n* Movement rules:\n  - You may move only through non-4 cells (i.e., never overlap a 4 after a move).\n  - If any part of your 8×8 sprite would overlap a 4 in the target direction (including cases where 4s lie “under” 9s), that move is ILLEGAL.\n  - If your sprite is already touching 4s on a side, you cannot move further in that touching direction until you have clearance.\n  - Practically: navigate corridors “between the 4s”.\n\n# KEYS, EXIT, AND HOW TO FIND THEM\n* The EXIT contains (or is adjacent to) the target key pattern and is marked by nearby 5s (it need not be fully surrounded; any 5s strongly indicate the exit region).\n* The bottom-left of the entire grid shows the REQUIRED KEY BLUEPRINT you must match: a specific layout of 0s (white) and 9s (blue).\n* Key generation mechanism (explicit):\n  - The KEY GENERATOR is a field/patch consisting of 0s and 9s that is NOT surrounded by 5s (i.e., not the exit).\n  - When any part of your 8×8 player walks onto this patch, a NEW candidate key is generated and displayed in the bottom-left.\n  - Step OFF the patch and then back ON to generate yet another candidate key; repeat to cycle through possibilities.\n  - You must keep cycling until the bottom-left candidate key EXACTLY matches the exit’s key (the same distribution of 0s and 9s seen within/adjacent to the 5s).\n* A reliable way to locate both the EXIT and the KEY GENERATOR area:\n  - Look for clusters of 0s and 9s reachable via 3s; if they are NOT framed by 5s, that area is most likely the generator. If you see 5s nearby framing a matching 0/9 pattern, that marks the exit.\n* When the pattern shown in the bottom-left matches the arrangement of 0s and 9s you see framed by (or adjacent to) 5s at the exit, move toward the 5s to complete the level.\n\n# HUD / PROGRESSION\n* Visual score on the second-to-last grid row (row 62): it contains several 4-cell “slots”.\n  - Slots made of 3s represent UNFINISHED levels.\n  - When a slot changes from 3s to another color, that level is COMPLETE.\n* Track remaining MOVES/ENERGY by counting tiles with value 15.\n* Track LIVES by counting distinct 2×2 blocks of 8s.\n\n# GENERAL NOTES\n* The grid is a bird’s-eye view.\n* If the grid does not change after an action, you likely attempted an illegal move into 4s.\n* Favor routes marked by 3s; scan for 0/9 patches (generator) and confirm exit by nearby 5s; confirm the key by matching the bottom-left blueprint of 0s/9s.\n\n# EXAMPLE STRATEGY OBSERVATION\nThe 8×8 player (top rows 12s, bottom rows 9s) is flush against 4s on the left, so LEFT is blocked. I can see a 0/9 patch reachable via 3s to the right (likely the generator) and some 5s beyond it, so I should move RIGHT toward that corridor, cycling the key on the generator until the bottom-left key matches the one at the exit.\n\n# TURN:\nCall exactly one action.\n"

One Frame is made of one or more sequential\nGrids. Each Grid is a matrix size INT<0,63> by INT<0,63> filled with\nINT<0,15> values. Each value represents a different color and usually implies a different object.\n\nYou are playing a game called LockSmith.\n\n# CONTROLS\n* RESET: start over\n* ACTION1: move up\n* ACTION2: move down\n* ACTION3: move left\n* ACTION4: move right\n* ACTION5/ACTION6: no-ops\n\n# GOAL\nFind/generate a key that MATCHES the key pattern shown at the EXIT, then navigate to the EXIT to finish the level.\nThere are 6 levels total. Complete all levels to WIN.\n\n# TILE MEANINGS (important ones)\n* 0 = white cell (used in key patterns)\n* 3 = walkable path / corridor marker (often outlines routes to key/exit)\n* 4 = WALL (solid). You cannot enter 4s.\n* 5 = EXIT indicator (presence of 5s marks/frames the exit area)\n* 8 = LIFE token (count lives as the number of 2×2 blocks of 8s)\n* 9 = blue cells (used in player lower body; also appear elsewhere in the map and in key logic)\n* 12 = orange cells (used in player upper body)\n* 15 = MOVE counter (number of 15s ≈ moves/energy left)\n\n# PLAYER (sprite + movement legality)\n* The player is an 8×8 sprite made ONLY of 12s (top two rows) over 9s (bottom six rows).\n  - Concretely: rows 0–1 (relative to the sprite) are all 12s; rows 2–7 are all 9s.\n  - Other scattered 9s on the board are NOT the player—only the exact 8×8 (2×8 of 12s stacked on 6×8 of 9s) is the player.\n* Movement rules:\n  - You may move only through non-4 cells (i.e., never overlap a 4 after a move).\n  - If any part of your 8×8 sprite would overlap a 4 in the target direction (including cases where 4s lie “under” 9s), that move is ILLEGAL.\n  - If your sprite is already touching 4s on a side, you cannot move further in that touching direction until you have clearance.\n  - Practically: navigate corridors “between the 4s”.\n\n# KEYS, EXIT, AND HOW TO FIND THEM\n* The EXIT contains (or is adjacent to) the target key pattern and is marked by nearby 5s (it need not be fully surrounded; any 5s strongly indicate the exit region).\n* The bottom-left of the entire grid shows the REQUIRED KEY BLUEPRINT you must match: a specific layout of 0s (white) and 9s (blue).\n* Key generation mechanism (explicit):\n  - The KEY GENERATOR is a field/patch consisting of 0s and 9s that is NOT surrounded by 5s (i.e., not the exit).\n  - When any part of your 8×8 player walks onto this patch, a NEW candidate key is generated and displayed in the bottom-left.\n  - Step OFF the patch and then back ON to generate yet another candidate key; repeat to cycle through possibilities.\n  - You must keep cycling until the bottom-left candidate key EXACTLY matches the exit’s key (the same distribution of 0s and 9s seen within/adjacent to the 5s).\n* A reliable way to locate both the EXIT and the KEY GENERATOR area:\n  - Look for clusters of 0s and 9s reachable via 3s; if they are NOT framed by 5s, that area is most likely the generator. If you see 5s nearby framing a matching 0/9 pattern, that marks the exit.\n* When the pattern shown in the bottom-left matches the arrangement of 0s and 9s you see framed by (or adjacent to) 5s at the exit, move toward the 5s to complete the level.\n\n# HUD / PROGRESSION\n* Visual score on the second-to-last grid row (row 62): it contains several 4-cell “slots”.\n  - Slots made of 3s represent UNFINISHED levels.\n  - When a slot changes from 3s to another color, that level is COMPLETE.\n* Track remaining MOVES/ENERGY by counting tiles with value 15.\n* Track LIVES by counting distinct 2×2 blocks of 8s.\n\n# GENERAL NOTES\n* The grid is a bird’s-eye view.\n* If the grid does not change after an action, you likely attempted an illegal move into 4s.\n* Favor routes marked by 3s; scan for 0/9 patches (generator) and confirm exit by nearby 5s; confirm the key by matching the bottom-left blueprint of 0s/9s.\n\n# EXAMPLE STRATEGY OBSERVATION\nThe 8×8 player (top rows 12s, bottom rows 9s) is flush against 4s on the left, so LEFT is blocked. I can see a 0/9 patch reachable via 3s to the right (likely the generator) and some 5s beyond it, so I should move RIGHT toward that corridor, cycling the key on the generator until the bottom-left key matches the one at the exit.\n\n# TURN:\nCall exactly one action.\n"

You cannot enter 4s.\n* 5 = EXIT indicator (presence of 5s marks/frames the exit area)\n* 8 = LIFE token (count lives as the number of 2×2 blocks of 8s)\n* 9 = blue cells (used in player lower body; also appear elsewhere in the map and in key logic)\n* 12 = orange cells (used in player upper body)\n* 15 = MOVE counter (number of 15s ≈ moves/energy left)\n\n# PLAYER (sprite + movement legality)\n* The player is an 8×8 sprite made ONLY of 12s (top two rows) over 9s (bottom six rows).\n  - Concretely: rows 0–1 (relative to the sprite) are all 12s; rows 2–7 are all 9s.\n  - Other scattered 9s on the board are NOT the player—only the exact 8×8 (2×8 of 12s stacked on 6×8 of 9s) is the player.\n* Movement rules:\n  - You may move only through non-4 cells (i.e., never overlap a 4 after a move).\n  - If any part of your 8×8 sprite would overlap a 4 in the target direction (including cases where 4s lie “under” 9s), that move is ILLEGAL.\n  - If your sprite is already touching 4s on a side, you cannot move further in that touching direction until you have clearance.\n  - Practically: navigate corridors “between the 4s”.\n\n# KEYS, EXIT, AND HOW TO FIND THEM\n* The EXIT contains (or is adjacent to) the target key pattern and is marked by nearby 5s (it need not be fully surrounded; any 5s strongly indicate the exit region).\n* The bottom-left of the entire grid shows the REQUIRED KEY BLUEPRINT you must match: a specific layout of 0s (white) and 9s (blue).\n* Key generation mechanism (explicit):\n  - The KEY GENERATOR is a field/patch consisting of 0s and 9s that is NOT surrounded by 5s (i.e., not the exit).\n  - When any part of your 8×8 player walks onto this patch, a NEW candidate key is generated and displayed in the bottom-left.\n  - Step OFF the patch and then back ON to generate yet another candidate key; repeat to cycle through possibilities.\n  - You must keep cycling until the bottom-left candidate key EXACTLY matches the exit’s key (the same distribution of 0s and 9s seen within/adjacent to the 5s).\n* A reliable way to locate both the EXIT and the KEY GENERATOR area:\n  - Look for clusters of 0s and 9s reachable via 3s; if they are NOT framed by 5s, that area is most likely the generator. If you see 5s nearby framing a matching 0/9 pattern, that marks the exit.\n* When the pattern shown in the bottom-left matches the arrangement of 0s and 9s you see framed by (or adjacent to) 5s at the exit, move toward the 5s to complete the level.\n\n# HUD / PROGRESSION\n* Visual score on the second-to-last grid row (row 62): it contains several 4-cell “slots”.\n  - Slots made of 3s represent UNFINISHED levels.\n  - When a slot changes from 3s to another color, that level is COMPLETE.\n* Track remaining MOVES/ENERGY by counting tiles with value 15.\n* Track LIVES by counting distinct 2×2 blocks of 8s.\n\n# GENERAL NOTES\n* The grid is a bird’s-eye view.\n* If the grid does not change after an action, you likely attempted an illegal move into 4s.\n* Favor routes marked by 3s; scan for 0/9 patches (generator) and confirm exit by nearby 5s; confirm the key by matching the bottom-left blueprint of 0s/9s.\n\n# EXAMPLE STRATEGY OBSERVATION\nThe 8×8 player (top rows 12s, bottom rows 9s) is flush against 4s on the left, so LEFT is blocked. I can see a 0/9 patch reachable via 3s to the right (likely the generator) and some 5s beyond it, so I should move RIGHT toward that corridor, cycling the key on the generator until the bottom-left key matches the one at the exit.\n\n# TURN:\nCall exactly one action.\n"

    "content": "\n# CONTEXT:\nYou are an agent playing a dynamic game. Your objective is to\nWIN and avoid GAME_OVER while minimizing actions.\n\nOne action produces one Frame. One Frame is made of one or more sequential\nGrids. Each Grid is a matrix size INT<0,63> by INT<0,63> filled with\nINT<0,15> values. Each value represents a different color and usually implies a different object.\n\nYou are playing a game called LockSmith.\n\n# CONTROLS\n* RESET: start over\n* ACTION1: move up\n* ACTION2: move down\n* ACTION3: move left\n* ACTION4: move right\n* ACTION5/ACTION6: no-ops\n\n# GOAL\nFind/generate a key that MATCHES the key pattern shown at the EXIT, then navigate to the EXIT to finish the level.\nThere are 6 levels total. Complete all levels to WIN.\n\n# TILE MEANINGS (important ones)\n* 0 = white cell (used in key patterns)\n* 3 = walkable path / corridor marker (often outlines routes to key/exit)\n* 4 = WALL (solid). You cannot enter 4s.\n* 5 = EXIT indicator (presence of 5s marks/frames the exit area)\n* 8 = LIFE token (count lives as the number of 2×2 blocks of 8s)\n* 9 = blue cells (used in player lower body; also appear elsewhere in the map and in key logic)\n* 12 = orange cells (used in player upper body)\n* 15 = MOVE counter (number of 15s ≈ moves/energy left)\n\n# PLAYER (sprite + movement legality)\n* The player is an 8×8 sprite made ONLY of 12s (top two rows) over 9s (bottom six rows).\n  - Concretely: rows 0–1 (relative to the sprite) are all 12s; rows 2–7 are all 9s.\n  - Other scattered 9s on the board are NOT the player—only the exact 8×8 (2×8 of 12s stacked on 6×8 of 9s) is the player.\n* Movement rules:\n  - You may move only through non-4 cells (i.e., never overlap a 4 after a move).\n  - If any part of your 8×8 sprite would overlap a 4 in the target direction (including cases where 4s lie “under” 9s), that move is ILLEGAL.\n  - If your sprite is already touching 4s on a side, you cannot move further in that touching direction until you have clearance.\n  - Practically: navigate corridors “between the 4s”.\n\n# KEYS, EXIT, AND HOW TO FIND THEM\n* The EXIT contains (or is adjacent to) the target key pattern and is marked by nearby 5s (it need not be fully surrounded; any 5s strongly indicate the exit region).\n* The bottom-left of the entire grid shows the REQUIRED KEY BLUEPRINT you must match: a specific layout of 0s (white) and 9s (blue).\n* Key generation mechanism (explicit):\n  - The KEY GENERATOR is a field/patch consisting of 0s and 9s that is NOT surrounded by 5s (i.e., not the exit).\n  - When any part of your 8×8 player walks onto this patch, a NEW candidate key is generated and displayed in the bottom-left.\n  - Step OFF the patch and then back ON to generate yet another candidate key; repeat to cycle through possibilities.\n  - You must keep cycling until the bottom-left candidate key EXACTLY matches the exit’s key (the same distribution of 0s and 9s seen within/adjacent to the 5s).\n* A reliable way to locate both the EXIT and the KEY GENERATOR area:\n  - Look for clusters of 0s and 9s reachable via 3s; if they are NOT framed by 5s, that area is most likely the generator. If you see 5s nearby framing a matching 0/9 pattern, that marks the exit.\n* When the pattern shown in the bottom-left matches the arrangement of 0s and 9s you see framed by (or adjacent to) 5s at the exit, move toward the 5s to complete the level.\n\n# HUD / PROGRESSION\n* Visual score on the second-to-last grid row (row 62): it contains several 4-cell “slots”.\n  - Slots made of 3s represent UNFINISHED levels.\n  - When a slot changes from 3s to another color, that level is COMPLETE.\n* Track remaining MOVES/ENERGY by counting tiles with value 15.\n* Track LIVES by counting distinct 2×2 blocks of 8s.\n\n# GENERAL NOTES\n* The grid is a bird’s-eye view.\n* If the grid does not change after an action, you likely attempted an illegal move into 4s.\n* Favor routes marked by 3s; scan for 0/9 patches (generator) and confirm exit by nearby 5s; confirm the key by matching the bottom-left blueprint of 0s/9s.\n\n# EXAMPLE STRATEGY OBSERVATION\nThe 8×8 player (top rows 12s, bottom rows 9s) is flush against 4s on the left, so LEFT is blocked. I can see a 0/9 patch reachable via 3s to the right (likely the generator) and some 5s beyond it, so I should move RIGHT toward that corridor, cycling the key on the generator until the bottom-left key matches the one at the exit.\n\n# TURN:\nCall exactly one action.\n"

One Frame is made of one or more sequential\nGrids. Each Grid is a matrix size INT<0,63> by INT<0,63> filled with\nINT<0,15> values. Each value represents a different color and usually implies a different object.\n\nYou are playing a game called LockSmith.\n\n# CONTROLS\n* RESET: start over\n* ACTION1: move up\n* ACTION2: move down\n* ACTION3: move left\n* ACTION4: move right\n* ACTION5/ACTION6: no-ops\n\n# GOAL\nFind/generate a key that MATCHES the key pattern shown at the EXIT, then navigate to the EXIT to finish the level.\nThere are 6 levels total. Complete all levels to WIN.\n\n# TILE MEANINGS (important ones)\n* 0 = white cell (used in key patterns)\n* 3 = walkable path / corridor marker (often outlines routes to key/exit)\n* 4 = WALL (solid). You cannot enter 4s.\n* 5 = EXIT indicator (presence of 5s marks/frames the exit area)\n* 8 = LIFE token (count lives as the number of 2×2 blocks of 8s)\n* 9 = blue cells (used in player lower body; also appear elsewhere in the map and in key logic)\n* 12 = orange cells (used in player upper body)\n* 15 = MOVE counter (number of 15s ≈ moves/energy left)\n\n# PLAYER (sprite + movement legality)\n* The player is an 8×8 sprite made ONLY of 12s (top two rows) over 9s (bottom six rows).\n  - Concretely: rows 0–1 (relative to the sprite) are all 12s; rows 2–7 are all 9s.\n  - Other scattered 9s on the board are NOT the player—only the exact 8×8 (2×8 of 12s stacked on 6×8 of 9s) is the player.\n* Movement rules:\n  - You may move only through non-4 cells (i.e., never overlap a 4 after a move).\n  - If any part of your 8×8 sprite would overlap a 4 in the target direction (including cases where 4s lie “under” 9s), that move is ILLEGAL.\n  - If your sprite is already touching 4s on a side, you cannot move further in that touching direction until you have clearance.\n  - Practically: navigate corridors “between the 4s”.\n\n# KEYS, EXIT, AND HOW TO FIND THEM\n* The EXIT contains (or is adjacent to) the target key pattern and is marked by nearby 5s (it need not be fully surrounded; any 5s strongly indicate the exit region).\n* The bottom-left of the entire grid shows the REQUIRED KEY BLUEPRINT you must match: a specific layout of 0s (white) and 9s (blue).\n* Key generation mechanism (explicit):\n  - The KEY GENERATOR is a field/patch consisting of 0s and 9s that is NOT surrounded by 5s (i.e., not the exit).\n  - When any part of your 8×8 player walks onto this patch, a NEW candidate key is generated and displayed in the bottom-left.\n  - Step OFF the patch and then back ON to generate yet another candidate key; repeat to cycle through possibilities.\n  - You must keep cycling until the bottom-left candidate key EXACTLY matches the exit’s key (the same distribution of 0s and 9s seen within/adjacent to the 5s).\n* A reliable way to locate both the EXIT and the KEY GENERATOR area:\n  - Look for clusters of 0s and 9s reachable via 3s; if they are NOT framed by 5s, that area is most likely the generator. If you see 5s nearby framing a matching 0/9 pattern, that marks the exit.\n* When the pattern shown in the bottom-left matches the arrangement of 0s and 9s you see framed by (or adjacent to) 5s at the exit, move toward the 5s to complete the level.\n\n# HUD / PROGRESSION\n* Visual score on the second-to-last grid row (row 62): it contains several 4-cell “slots”.\n  - Slots made of 3s represent UNFINISHED levels.\n  - When a slot changes from 3s to another color, that level is COMPLETE.\n* Track remaining MOVES/ENERGY by counting tiles with value 15.\n* Track LIVES by counting distinct 2×2 blocks of 8s.\n\n# GENERAL NOTES\n* The grid is a bird’s-eye view.\n* If the grid does not change after an action, you likely attempted an illegal move into 4s.\n* Favor routes marked by 3s; scan for 0/9 patches (generator) and confirm exit by nearby 5s; confirm the key by matching the bottom-left blueprint of 0s/9s.\n\n# EXAMPLE STRATEGY OBSERVATION\nThe 8×8 player (top rows 12s, bottom rows 9s) is flush against 4s on the left, so LEFT is blocked. I can see a 0/9 patch reachable via 3s to the right (likely the generator) and some 5s beyond it, so I should move RIGHT toward that corridor, cycling the key on the generator until the bottom-left key matches the one at the exit.\n\n# TURN:\nCall exactly one action.\n"

Each value represents a different color and usually implies a different object.\n\nYou are playing a game called LockSmith.\n\n# CONTROLS\n* RESET: start over\n* ACTION1: move up\n* ACTION2: move down\n* ACTION3: move left\n* ACTION4: move right\n* ACTION5/ACTION6: no-ops\n\n# GOAL\nFind/generate a key that MATCHES the key pattern shown at the EXIT, then navigate to the EXIT to finish the level.\nThere are 6 levels total. Complete all levels to WIN.\n\n# TILE MEANINGS (important ones)\n* 0 = white cell (used in key patterns)\n* 3 = walkable path / corridor marker (often outlines routes to key/exit)\n* 4 = WALL (solid). You cannot enter 4s.\n* 5 = EXIT indicator (presence of 5s marks/frames the exit area)\n* 8 = LIFE token (count lives as the number of 2×2 blocks of 8s)\n* 9 = blue cells (used in player lower body; also appear elsewhere in the map and in key logic)\n* 12 = orange cells (used in player upper body)\n* 15 = MOVE counter (number of 15s ≈ moves/energy left)\n\n# PLAYER (sprite + movement legality)\n* The player is an 8×8 sprite made ONLY of 12s (top two rows) over 9s (bottom six rows).\n  - Concretely: rows 0–1 (relative to the sprite) are all 12s; rows 2–7 are all 9s.\n  - Other scattered 9s on the board are NOT the player—only the exact 8×8 (2×8 of 12s stacked on 6×8 of 9s) is the player.\n* Movement rules:\n  - You may move only through non-4 cells (i.e., never overlap a 4 after a move).\n  - If any part of your 8×8 sprite would overlap a 4 in the target direction (including cases where 4s lie “under” 9s), that move is ILLEGAL.\n  - If your sprite is already touching 4s on a side, you cannot move further in that touching direction until you have clearance.\n  - Practically: navigate corridors “between the 4s”.\n\n# KEYS, EXIT, AND HOW TO FIND THEM\n* The EXIT contains (or is adjacent to) the target key pattern and is marked by nearby 5s (it need not be fully surrounded; any 5s strongly indicate the exit region).\n* The bottom-left of the entire grid shows the REQUIRED KEY BLUEPRINT you must match: a specific layout of 0s (white) and 9s (blue).\n* Key generation mechanism (explicit):\n  - The KEY GENERATOR is a field/patch consisting of 0s and 9s that is NOT surrounded by 5s (i.e., not the exit).\n  - When any part of your 8×8 player walks onto this patch, a NEW candidate key is generated and displayed in the bottom-left.\n  - Step OFF the patch and then back ON to generate yet another candidate key; repeat to cycle through possibilities.\n  - You must keep cycling until the bottom-left candidate key EXACTLY matches the exit’s key (the same distribution of 0s and 9s seen within/adjacent to the 5s).\n* A reliable way to locate both the EXIT and the KEY GENERATOR area:\n  - Look for clusters of 0s and 9s reachable via 3s; if they are NOT framed by 5s, that area is most likely the generator. If you see 5s nearby framing a matching 0/9 pattern, that marks the exit.\n* When the pattern shown in the bottom-left matches the arrangement of 0s and 9s you see framed by (or adjacent to) 5s at the exit, move toward the 5s to complete the level.\n\n# HUD / PROGRESSION\n* Visual score on the second-to-last grid row (row 62): it contains several 4-cell “slots”.\n  - Slots made of 3s represent UNFINISHED levels.\n  - When a slot changes from 3s to another color, that level is COMPLETE.\n* Track remaining MOVES/ENERGY by counting tiles with value 15.\n* Track LIVES by counting distinct 2×2 blocks of 8s.\n\n# GENERAL NOTES\n* The grid is a bird’s-eye view.\n* If the grid does not change after an action, you likely attempted an illegal move into 4s.\n* Favor routes marked by 3s; scan for 0/9 patches (generator) and confirm exit by nearby 5s; confirm the key by matching the bottom-left blueprint of 0s/9s.\n\n# EXAMPLE STRATEGY OBSERVATION\nThe 8×8 player (top rows 12s, bottom rows 9s) is flush against 4s on the left, so LEFT is blocked. I can see a 0/9 patch reachable via 3s to the right (likely the generator) and some 5s beyond it, so I should move RIGHT toward that corridor, cycling the key on the generator until the bottom-left key matches the one at the exit.\n\n# TURN:\nCall exactly one action.\n"

    "content": "\n# CONTEXT:\nYou are an agent playing a dynamic game. Your objective is to\nWIN and avoid GAME_OVER while minimizing actions.\n\nOne action produces one Frame. One Frame is made of one or more sequential\nGrids. Each Grid is a matrix size INT<0,63> by INT<0,63> filled with\nINT<0,15> values. Each value represents a different color and usually implies a different object.\n\nYou are playing a game called LockSmith.\n\n# CONTROLS\n* RESET: start over\n* ACTION1: move up\n* ACTION2: move down\n* ACTION3: move left\n* ACTION4: move right\n* ACTION5/ACTION6: no-ops\n\n# GOAL\nFind/generate a key that MATCHES the key pattern shown at the EXIT, then navigate to the EXIT to finish the level.\nThere are 6 levels total. Complete all levels to WIN.\n\n# TILE MEANINGS (important ones)\n* 0 = white cell (used in key patterns)\n* 3 = walkable path / corridor marker (often outlines routes to key/exit)\n* 4 = WALL (solid). You cannot enter 4s.\n* 5 = EXIT indicator (presence of 5s marks/frames the exit area)\n* 8 = LIFE token (count lives as the number of 2×2 blocks of 8s)\n* 9 = blue cells (used in player lower body; also appear elsewhere in the map and in key logic)\n* 12 = orange cells (used in player upper body)\n* 15 = MOVE counter (number of 15s ≈ moves/energy left)\n\n# PLAYER (sprite + movement legality)\n* The player is an 8×8 sprite made ONLY of 12s (top two rows) over 9s (bottom six rows).\n  - Concretely: rows 0–1 (relative to the sprite) are all 12s; rows 2–7 are all 9s.\n  - Other scattered 9s on the board are NOT the player—only the exact 8×8 (2×8 of 12s stacked on 6×8 of 9s) is the player.\n* Movement rules:\n  - You may move only through non-4 cells (i.e., never overlap a 4 after a move).\n  - If any part of your 8×8 sprite would overlap a 4 in the target direction (including cases where 4s lie “under” 9s), that move is ILLEGAL.\n  - If your sprite is already touching 4s on a side, you cannot move further in that touching direction until you have clearance.\n  - Practically: navigate corridors “between the 4s”.\n\n# KEYS, EXIT, AND HOW TO FIND THEM\n* The EXIT contains (or is adjacent to) the target key pattern and is marked by nearby 5s (it need not be fully surrounded; any 5s strongly indicate the exit region).\n* The bottom-left of the entire grid shows the REQUIRED KEY BLUEPRINT you must match: a specific layout of 0s (white) and 9s (blue).\n* Key generation mechanism (explicit):\n  - The KEY GENERATOR is a field/patch consisting of 0s and 9s that is NOT surrounded by 5s (i.e., not the exit).\n  - When any part of your 8×8 player walks onto this patch, a NEW candidate key is generated and displayed in the bottom-left.\n  - Step OFF the patch and then back ON to generate yet another candidate key; repeat to cycle through possibilities.\n  - You must keep cycling until the bottom-left candidate key EXACTLY matches the exit’s key (the same distribution of 0s and 9s seen within/adjacent to the 5s).\n* A reliable way to locate both the EXIT and the KEY GENERATOR area:\n  - Look for clusters of 0s and 9s reachable via 3s; if they are NOT framed by 5s, that area is most likely the generator. If you see 5s nearby framing a matching 0/9 pattern, that marks the exit.\n* When the pattern shown in the bottom-left matches the arrangement of 0s and 9s you see framed by (or adjacent to) 5s at the exit, move toward the 5s to complete the level.\n\n# HUD / PROGRESSION\n* Visual score on the second-to-last grid row (row 62): it contains several 4-cell “slots”.\n  - Slots made of 3s represent UNFINISHED levels.\n  - When a slot changes from 3s to another color, that level is COMPLETE.\n* Track remaining MOVES/ENERGY by counting tiles with value 15.\n* Track LIVES by counting distinct 2×2 blocks of 8s.\n\n# GENERAL NOTES\n* The grid is a bird’s-eye view.\n* If the grid does not change after an action, you likely attempted an illegal move into 4s.\n* Favor routes marked by 3s; scan for 0/9 patches (generator) and confirm exit by nearby 5s; confirm the key by matching the bottom-left blueprint of 0s/9s.\n\n# EXAMPLE STRATEGY OBSERVATION\nThe 8×8 player (top rows 12s, bottom rows 9s) is flush against 4s on the left, so LEFT is blocked. I can see a 0/9 patch reachable via 3s to the right (likely the generator) and some 5s beyond it, so I should move RIGHT toward that corridor, cycling the key on the generator until the bottom-left key matches the one at the exit.\n\n# TURN:\nCall exactly one action.\n"

    "content": "\n# CONTEXT:\nYou are an agent playing a dynamic game. Your objective is to\nWIN and avoid GAME_OVER while minimizing actions.\n\nOne action produces one Frame. One Frame is made of one or more sequential\nGrids. Each Grid is a matrix size INT<0,63> by INT<0,63> filled with\nINT<0,15> values. Each value represents a different color and usually implies a different object.\n\nYou are playing a game called LockSmith.\n\n# CONTROLS\n* RESET: start over\n* ACTION1: move up\n* ACTION2: move down\n* ACTION3: move left\n* ACTION4: move right\n* ACTION5/ACTION6: no-ops\n\n# GOAL\nFind/generate a key that MATCHES the key pattern shown at the EXIT, then navigate to the EXIT to finish the level.\nThere are 6 levels total. Complete all levels to WIN.\n\n# TILE MEANINGS (important ones)\n* 0 = white cell (used in key patterns)\n* 3 = walkable path / corridor marker (often outlines routes to key/exit)\n* 4 = WALL (solid). You cannot enter 4s.\n* 5 = EXIT indicator (presence of 5s marks/frames the exit area)\n* 8 = LIFE token (count lives as the number of 2×2 blocks of 8s)\n* 9 = blue cells (used in player lower body; also appear elsewhere in the map and in key logic)\n* 12 = orange cells (used in player upper body)\n* 15 = MOVE counter (number of 15s ≈ moves/energy left)\n\n# PLAYER (sprite + movement legality)\n* The player is an 8×8 sprite made ONLY of 12s (top two rows) over 9s (bottom six rows).\n  - Concretely: rows 0–1 (relative to the sprite) are all 12s; rows 2–7 are all 9s.\n  - Other scattered 9s on the board are NOT the player—only the exact 8×8 (2×8 of 12s stacked on 6×8 of 9s) is the player.\n* Movement rules:\n  - You may move only through non-4 cells (i.e., never overlap a 4 after a move).\n  - If any part of your 8×8 sprite would overlap a 4 in the target direction (including cases where 4s lie “under” 9s), that move is ILLEGAL.\n  - If your sprite is already touching 4s on a side, you cannot move further in that touching direction until you have clearance.\n  - Practically: navigate corridors “between the 4s”.\n\n# KEYS, EXIT, AND HOW TO FIND THEM\n* The EXIT contains (or is adjacent to) the target key pattern and is marked by nearby 5s (it need not be fully surrounded; any 5s strongly indicate the exit region).\n* The bottom-left of the entire grid shows the REQUIRED KEY BLUEPRINT you must match: a specific layout of 0s (white) and 9s (blue).\n* Key generation mechanism (explicit):\n  - The KEY GENERATOR is a field/patch consisting of 0s and 9s that is NOT surrounded by 5s (i.e., not the exit).\n  - When any part of your 8×8 player walks onto this patch, a NEW candidate key is generated and displayed in the bottom-left.\n  - Step OFF the patch and then back ON to generate yet another candidate key; repeat to cycle through possibilities.\n  - You must keep cycling until the bottom-left candidate key EXACTLY matches the exit’s key (the same distribution of 0s and 9s seen within/adjacent to the 5s).\n* A reliable way to locate both the EXIT and the KEY GENERATOR area:\n  - Look for clusters of 0s and 9s reachable via 3s; if they are NOT framed by 5s, that area is most likely the generator. If you see 5s nearby framing a matching 0/9 pattern, that marks the exit.\n* When the pattern shown in the bottom-left matches the arrangement of 0s and 9s you see framed by (or adjacent to) 5s at the exit, move toward the 5s to complete the level.\n\n# HUD / PROGRESSION\n* Visual score on the second-to-last grid row (row 62): it contains several 4-cell “slots”.\n  - Slots made of 3s represent UNFINISHED levels.\n  - When a slot changes from 3s to another color, that level is COMPLETE.\n* Track remaining MOVES/ENERGY by counting tiles with value 15.\n* Track LIVES by counting distinct 2×2 blocks of 8s.\n\n# GENERAL NOTES\n* The grid is a bird’s-eye view.\n* If the grid does not change after an action, you likely attempted an illegal move into 4s.\n* Favor routes marked by 3s; scan for 0/9 patches (generator) and confirm exit by nearby 5s; confirm the key by matching the bottom-left blueprint of 0s/9s.\n\n# EXAMPLE STRATEGY OBSERVATION\nThe 8×8 player (top rows 12s, bottom rows 9s) is flush against 4s on the left, so LEFT is blocked. I can see a 0/9 patch reachable via 3s to the right (likely the generator) and some 5s beyond it, so I should move RIGHT toward that corridor, cycling the key on the generator until the bottom-left key matches the one at the exit.\n\n# TURN:\nCall exactly one action.\n"

The exit region shows a 0/9 key pattern framed by 5s (the target). A separate 0/9 patch (the generator) lies back down the corridor reachable via the 3s; stepping onto that patch will cycle candidate keys in the bottom-left blueprint. If the bottom-left blueprint already matches the exit, move into the 5s to finish; otherwise I should backtrack onto the generator and step off/on repeatedly to cycle keys until it matches."

    "content": "\n# CONTEXT:\nYou are an agent playing a dynamic game. Your objective is to\nWIN and avoid GAME_OVER while minimizing actions.\n\nOne action produces one Frame. One Frame is made of one or more sequential\nGrids. Each Grid is a matrix size INT<0,63> by INT<0,63> filled with\nINT<0,15> values. Each value represents a different color and usually implies a different object.\n\nYou are playing a game called LockSmith.\n\n# CONTROLS\n* RESET: start over\n* ACTION1: move up\n* ACTION2: move down\n* ACTION3: move left\n* ACTION4: move right\n* ACTION5/ACTION6: no-ops\n\n# GOAL\nFind/generate a key that MATCHES the key pattern shown at the EXIT, then navigate to the EXIT to finish the level.\nThere are 6 levels total. Complete all levels to WIN.\n\n# TILE MEANINGS (important ones)\n* 0 = white cell (used in key patterns)\n* 3 = walkable path / corridor marker (often outlines routes to key/exit)\n* 4 = WALL (solid). You cannot enter 4s.\n* 5 = EXIT indicator (presence of 5s marks/frames the exit area)\n* 8 = LIFE token (count lives as the number of 2×2 blocks of 8s)\n* 9 = blue cells (used in player lower body; also appear elsewhere in the map and in key logic)\n* 12 = orange cells (used in player upper body)\n* 15 = MOVE counter (number of 15s ≈ moves/energy left)\n\n# PLAYER (sprite + movement legality)\n* The player is an 8×8 sprite made ONLY of 12s (top two rows) over 9s (bottom six rows).\n  - Concretely: rows 0–1 (relative to the sprite) are all 12s; rows 2–7 are all 9s.\n  - Other scattered 9s on the board are NOT the player—only the exact 8×8 (2×8 of 12s stacked on 6×8 of 9s) is the player.\n* Movement rules:\n  - You may move only through non-4 cells (i.e., never overlap a 4 after a move).\n  - If any part of your 8×8 sprite would overlap a 4 in the target direction (including cases where 4s lie “under” 9s), that move is ILLEGAL.\n  - If your sprite is already touching 4s on a side, you cannot move further in that touching direction until you have clearance.\n  - Practically: navigate corridors “between the 4s”.\n\n# KEYS, EXIT, AND HOW TO FIND THEM\n* The EXIT contains (or is adjacent to) the target key pattern and is marked by nearby 5s (it need not be fully surrounded; any 5s strongly indicate the exit region).\n* The bottom-left of the entire grid shows the REQUIRED KEY BLUEPRINT you must match: a specific layout of 0s (white) and 9s (blue).\n* Key generation mechanism (explicit):\n  - The KEY GENERATOR is a field/patch consisting of 0s and 9s that is NOT surrounded by 5s (i.e., not the exit).\n  - When any part of your 8×8 player walks onto this patch, a NEW candidate key is generated and displayed in the bottom-left.\n  - Step OFF the patch and then back ON to generate yet another candidate key; repeat to cycle through possibilities.\n  - You must keep cycling until the bottom-left candidate key EXACTLY matches the exit’s key (the same distribution of 0s and 9s seen within/adjacent to the 5s).\n* A reliable way to locate both the EXIT and the KEY GENERATOR area:\n  - Look for clusters of 0s and 9s reachable via 3s; if they are NOT framed by 5s, that area is most likely the generator. If you see 5s nearby framing a matching 0/9 pattern, that marks the exit.\n* When the pattern shown in the bottom-left matches the arrangement of 0s and 9s you see framed by (or adjacent to) 5s at the exit, move toward the 5s to complete the level.\n\n# HUD / PROGRESSION\n* Visual score on the second-to-last grid row (row 62): it contains several 4-cell “slots”.\n  - Slots made of 3s represent UNFINISHED levels.\n  - When a slot changes from 3s to another color, that level is COMPLETE.\n* Track remaining MOVES/ENERGY by counting tiles with value 15.\n* Track LIVES by counting distinct 2×2 blocks of 8s.\n\n# GENERAL NOTES\n* The grid is a bird’s-eye view.\n* If the grid does not change after an action, you likely attempted an illegal move into 4s.\n* Favor routes marked by 3s; scan for 0/9 patches (generator) and confirm exit by nearby 5s; confirm the key by matching the bottom-left blueprint of 0s/9s.\n\n# EXAMPLE STRATEGY OBSERVATION\nThe 8×8 player (top rows 12s, bottom rows 9s) is flush against 4s on the left, so LEFT is blocked. I can see a 0/9 patch reachable via 3s to the right (likely the generator) and some 5s beyond it, so I should move RIGHT toward that corridor, cycling the key on the generator until the bottom-left key matches the one at the exit.\n\n# TURN:\nCall exactly one action.\n"

    "content": "\n# CONTEXT:\nYou are an agent playing a dynamic game. Your objective is to\nWIN and avoid GAME_OVER while minimizing actions.\n\nOne action produces one Frame. One Frame is made of one or more sequential\nGrids. Each Grid is a matrix size INT<0,63> by INT<0,63> filled with\nINT<0,15> values. Each value represents a different color and usually implies a different object.\n\nYou are playing a game called LockSmith.\n\n# CONTROLS\n* RESET: start over\n* ACTION1: move up\n* ACTION2: move down\n* ACTION3: move left\n* ACTION4: move right\n* ACTION5/ACTION6: no-ops\n\n# GOAL\nFind/generate a key that MATCHES the key pattern shown at the EXIT, then navigate to the EXIT to finish the level.\nThere are 6 levels total. Complete all levels to WIN.\n\n# TILE MEANINGS (important ones)\n* 0 = white cell (used in key patterns)\n* 3 = walkable path / corridor marker (often outlines routes to key/exit)\n* 4 = WALL (solid). You cannot enter 4s.\n* 5 = EXIT indicator (presence of 5s marks/frames the exit area)\n* 8 = LIFE token (count lives as the number of 2×2 blocks of 8s)\n* 9 = blue cells (used in player lower body; also appear elsewhere in the map and in key logic)\n* 12 = orange cells (used in player upper body)\n* 15 = MOVE counter (number of 15s ≈ moves/energy left)\n\n# PLAYER (sprite + movement legality)\n* The player is an 8×8 sprite made ONLY of 12s (top two rows) over 9s (bottom six rows).\n  - Concretely: rows 0–1 (relative to the sprite) are all 12s; rows 2–7 are all 9s.\n  - Other scattered 9s on the board are NOT the player—only the exact 8×8 (2×8 of 12s stacked on 6×8 of 9s) is the player.\n* Movement rules:\n  - You may move only through non-4 cells (i.e., never overlap a 4 after a move).\n  - If any part of your 8×8 sprite would overlap a 4 in the target direction (including cases where 4s lie “under” 9s), that move is ILLEGAL.\n  - If your sprite is already touching 4s on a side, you cannot move further in that touching direction until you have clearance.\n  - Practically: navigate corridors “between the 4s”.\n\n# KEYS, EXIT, AND HOW TO FIND THEM\n* The EXIT contains (or is adjacent to) the target key pattern and is marked by nearby 5s (it need not be fully surrounded; any 5s strongly indicate the exit region).\n* The bottom-left of the entire grid shows the REQUIRED KEY BLUEPRINT you must match: a specific layout of 0s (white) and 9s (blue).\n* Key generation mechanism (explicit):\n  - The KEY GENERATOR is a field/patch consisting of 0s and 9s that is NOT surrounded by 5s (i.e., not the exit).\n  - When any part of your 8×8 player walks onto this patch, a NEW candidate key is generated and displayed in the bottom-left.\n  - Step OFF the patch and then back ON to generate yet another candidate key; repeat to cycle through possibilities.\n  - You must keep cycling until the bottom-left candidate key EXACTLY matches the exit’s key (the same distribution of 0s and 9s seen within/adjacent to the 5s).\n* A reliable way to locate both the EXIT and the KEY GENERATOR area:\n  - Look for clusters of 0s and 9s reachable via 3s; if they are NOT framed by 5s, that area is most likely the generator. If you see 5s nearby framing a matching 0/9 pattern, that marks the exit.\n* When the pattern shown in the bottom-left matches the arrangement of 0s and 9s you see framed by (or adjacent to) 5s at the exit, move toward the 5s to complete the level.\n\n# HUD / PROGRESSION\n* Visual score on the second-to-last grid row (row 62): it contains several 4-cell “slots”.\n  - Slots made of 3s represent UNFINISHED levels.\n  - When a slot changes from 3s to another color, that level is COMPLETE.\n* Track remaining MOVES/ENERGY by counting tiles with value 15.\n* Track LIVES by counting distinct 2×2 blocks of 8s.\n\n# GENERAL NOTES\n* The grid is a bird’s-eye view.\n* If the grid does not change after an action, you likely attempted an illegal move into 4s.\n* Favor routes marked by 3s; scan for 0/9 patches (generator) and confirm exit by nearby 5s; confirm the key by matching the bottom-left blueprint of 0s/9s.\n\n# EXAMPLE STRATEGY OBSERVATION\nThe 8×8 player (top rows 12s, bottom rows 9s) is flush against 4s on the left, so LEFT is blocked. I can see a 0/9 patch reachable via 3s to the right (likely the generator) and some 5s beyond it, so I should move RIGHT toward that corridor, cycling the key on the generator until the bottom-left key matches the one at the exit.\n\n# TURN:\nCall exactly one action.\n"

    "content": "\n# CONTEXT:\nYou are an agent playing a dynamic game. Your objective is to\nWIN and avoid GAME_OVER while minimizing actions.\n\nOne action produces one Frame. One Frame is made of one or more sequential\nGrids. Each Grid is a matrix size INT<0,63> by INT<0,63> filled with\nINT<0,15> values. Each value represents a different color and usually implies a different object.\n\nYou are playing a game called LockSmith.\n\n# CONTROLS\n* RESET: start over\n* ACTION1: move up\n* ACTION2: move down\n* ACTION3: move left\n* ACTION4: move right\n* ACTION5/ACTION6: no-ops\n\n# GOAL\nFind/generate a key that MATCHES the key pattern shown at the EXIT, then navigate to the EXIT to finish the level.\nThere are 6 levels total. Complete all levels to WIN.\n\n# TILE MEANINGS (important ones)\n* 0 = white cell (used in key patterns)\n* 3 = walkable path / corridor marker (often outlines routes to key/exit)\n* 4 = WALL (solid). You cannot enter 4s.\n* 5 = EXIT indicator (presence of 5s marks/frames the exit area)\n* 8 = LIFE token (count lives as the number of 2×2 blocks of 8s)\n* 9 = blue cells (used in player lower body; also appear elsewhere in the map and in key logic)\n* 12 = orange cells (used in player upper body)\n* 15 = MOVE counter (number of 15s ≈ moves/energy left)\n\n# PLAYER (sprite + movement legality)\n* The player is an 8×8 sprite made ONLY of 12s (top two rows) over 9s (bottom six rows).\n  - Concretely: rows 0–1 (relative to the sprite) are all 12s; rows 2–7 are all 9s.\n  - Other scattered 9s on the board are NOT the player—only the exact 8×8 (2×8 of 12s stacked on 6×8 of 9s) is the player.\n* Movement rules:\n  - You may move only through non-4 cells (i.e., never overlap a 4 after a move).\n  - If any part of your 8×8 sprite would overlap a 4 in the target direction (including cases where 4s lie “under” 9s), that move is ILLEGAL.\n  - If your sprite is already touching 4s on a side, you cannot move further in that touching direction until you have clearance.\n  - Practically: navigate corridors “between the 4s”.\n\n# KEYS, EXIT, AND HOW TO FIND THEM\n* The EXIT contains (or is adjacent to) the target key pattern and is marked by nearby 5s (it need not be fully surrounded; any 5s strongly indicate the exit region).\n* The bottom-left of the entire grid shows the REQUIRED KEY BLUEPRINT you must match: a specific layout of 0s (white) and 9s (blue).\n* Key generation mechanism (explicit):\n  - The KEY GENERATOR is a field/patch consisting of 0s and 9s that is NOT surrounded by 5s (i.e., not the exit).\n  - When any part of your 8×8 player walks onto this patch, a NEW candidate key is generated and displayed in the bottom-left.\n  - Step OFF the patch and then back ON to generate yet another candidate key; repeat to cycle through possibilities.\n  - You must keep cycling until the bottom-left candidate key EXACTLY matches the exit’s key (the same distribution of 0s and 9s seen within/adjacent to the 5s).\n* A reliable way to locate both the EXIT and the KEY GENERATOR area:\n  - Look for clusters of 0s and 9s reachable via 3s; if they are NOT framed by 5s, that area is most likely the generator. If you see 5s nearby framing a matching 0/9 pattern, that marks the exit.\n* When the pattern shown in the bottom-left matches the arrangement of 0s and 9s you see framed by (or adjacent to) 5s at the exit, move toward the 5s to complete the level.\n\n# HUD / PROGRESSION\n* Visual score on the second-to-last grid row (row 62): it contains several 4-cell “slots”.\n  - Slots made of 3s represent UNFINISHED levels.\n  - When a slot changes from 3s to another color, that level is COMPLETE.\n* Track remaining MOVES/ENERGY by counting tiles with value 15.\n* Track LIVES by counting distinct 2×2 blocks of 8s.\n\n# GENERAL NOTES\n* The grid is a bird’s-eye view.\n* If the grid does not change after an action, you likely attempted an illegal move into 4s.\n* Favor routes marked by 3s; scan for 0/9 patches (generator) and confirm exit by nearby 5s; confirm the key by matching the bottom-left blueprint of 0s/9s.\n\n# EXAMPLE STRATEGY OBSERVATION\nThe 8×8 player (top rows 12s, bottom rows 9s) is flush against 4s on the left, so LEFT is blocked. I can see a 0/9 patch reachable via 3s to the right (likely the generator) and some 5s beyond it, so I should move RIGHT toward that corridor, cycling the key on the generator until the bottom-left key matches the one at the exit.\n\n# TURN:\nCall exactly one action.\n"

That means I must only enter the 5s once the bottom-left blueprint matches that exit pattern. I also see a separate 0/9 patch (the generator) down-left along the corridor of 3s; I should navigate into that corridor and step onto/off the generator to cycle candidate keys until the bottom-left blueprint matches the exit, then move into the 5s to finish."

    "content": "\n# CONTEXT:\nYou are an agent playing a dynamic game. Your objective is to\nWIN and avoid GAME_OVER while minimizing actions.\n\nOne action produces one Frame. One Frame is made of one or more sequential\nGrids. Each Grid is a matrix size INT<0,63> by INT<0,63> filled with\nINT<0,15> values. Each value represents a different color and usually implies a different object.\n\nYou are playing a game called LockSmith.\n\n# CONTROLS\n* RESET: start over\n* ACTION1: move up\n* ACTION2: move down\n* ACTION3: move left\n* ACTION4: move right\n* ACTION5/ACTION6: no-ops\n\n# GOAL\nFind/generate a key that MATCHES the key pattern shown at the EXIT, then navigate to the EXIT to finish the level.\nThere are 6 levels total. Complete all levels to WIN.\n\n# TILE MEANINGS (important ones)\n* 0 = white cell (used in key patterns)\n* 3 = walkable path / corridor marker (often outlines routes to key/exit)\n* 4 = WALL (solid). You cannot enter 4s.\n* 5 = EXIT indicator (presence of 5s marks/frames the exit area)\n* 8 = LIFE token (count lives as the number of 2×2 blocks of 8s)\n* 9 = blue cells (used in player lower body; also appear elsewhere in the map and in key logic)\n* 12 = orange cells (used in player upper body)\n* 15 = MOVE counter (number of 15s ≈ moves/energy left)\n\n# PLAYER (sprite + movement legality)\n* The player is an 8×8 sprite made ONLY of 12s (top two rows) over 9s (bottom six rows).\n  - Concretely: rows 0–1 (relative to the sprite) are all 12s; rows 2–7 are all 9s.\n  - Other scattered 9s on the board are NOT the player—only the exact 8×8 (2×8 of 12s stacked on 6×8 of 9s) is the player.\n* Movement rules:\n  - You may move only through non-4 cells (i.e., never overlap a 4 after a move).\n  - If any part of your 8×8 sprite would overlap a 4 in the target direction (including cases where 4s lie “under” 9s), that move is ILLEGAL.\n  - If your sprite is already touching 4s on a side, you cannot move further in that touching direction until you have clearance.\n  - Practically: navigate corridors “between the 4s”.\n\n# KEYS, EXIT, AND HOW TO FIND THEM\n* The EXIT contains (or is adjacent to) the target key pattern and is marked by nearby 5s (it need not be fully surrounded; any 5s strongly indicate the exit region).\n* The bottom-left of the entire grid shows the REQUIRED KEY BLUEPRINT you must match: a specific layout of 0s (white) and 9s (blue).\n* Key generation mechanism (explicit):\n  - The KEY GENERATOR is a field/patch consisting of 0s and 9s that is NOT surrounded by 5s (i.e., not the exit).\n  - When any part of your 8×8 player walks onto this patch, a NEW candidate key is generated and displayed in the bottom-left.\n  - Step OFF the patch and then back ON to generate yet another candidate key; repeat to cycle through possibilities.\n  - You must keep cycling until the bottom-left candidate key EXACTLY matches the exit’s key (the same distribution of 0s and 9s seen within/adjacent to the 5s).\n* A reliable way to locate both the EXIT and the KEY GENERATOR area:\n  - Look for clusters of 0s and 9s reachable via 3s; if they are NOT framed by 5s, that area is most likely the generator. If you see 5s nearby framing a matching 0/9 pattern, that marks the exit.\n* When the pattern shown in the bottom-left matches the arrangement of 0s and 9s you see framed by (or adjacent to) 5s at the exit, move toward the 5s to complete the level.\n\n# HUD / PROGRESSION\n* Visual score on the second-to-last grid row (row 62): it contains several 4-cell “slots”.\n  - Slots made of 3s represent UNFINISHED levels.\n  - When a slot changes from 3s to another color, that level is COMPLETE.\n* Track remaining MOVES/ENERGY by counting tiles with value 15.\n* Track LIVES by counting distinct 2×2 blocks of 8s.\n\n# GENERAL NOTES\n* The grid is a bird’s-eye view.\n* If the grid does not change after an action, you likely attempted an illegal move into 4s.\n* Favor routes marked by 3s; scan for 0/9 patches (generator) and confirm exit by nearby 5s; confirm the key by matching the bottom-left blueprint of 0s/9s.\n\n# EXAMPLE STRATEGY OBSERVATION\nThe 8×8 player (top rows 12s, bottom rows 9s) is flush against 4s on the left, so LEFT is blocked. I can see a 0/9 patch reachable via 3s to the right (likely the generator) and some 5s beyond it, so I should move RIGHT toward that corridor, cycling the key on the generator until the bottom-left key matches the one at the exit.\n\n# TURN:\nCall exactly one action.\n"

Complete all levels to WIN.\n\n# TILE MEANINGS (important ones)\n* 0 = white cell (used in key patterns)\n* 3 = walkable path / corridor marker (often outlines routes to key/exit)\n* 4 = WALL (solid). You cannot enter 4s.\n* 5 = EXIT indicator (presence of 5s marks/frames the exit area)\n* 8 = LIFE token (count lives as the number of 2×2 blocks of 8s)\n* 9 = blue cells (used in player lower body; also appear elsewhere in the map and in key logic)\n* 12 = orange cells (used in player upper body)\n* 15 = MOVE counter (number of 15s ≈ moves/energy left)\n\n# PLAYER (sprite + movement legality)\n* The player is an 8×8 sprite made ONLY of 12s (top two rows) over 9s (bottom six rows).\n  - Concretely: rows 0–1 (relative to the sprite) are all 12s; rows 2–7 are all 9s.\n  - Other scattered 9s on the board are NOT the player—only the exact 8×8 (2×8 of 12s stacked on 6×8 of 9s) is the player.\n* Movement rules:\n  - You may move only through non-4 cells (i.e., never overlap a 4 after a move).\n  - If any part of your 8×8 sprite would overlap a 4 in the target direction (including cases where 4s lie “under” 9s), that move is ILLEGAL.\n  - If your sprite is already touching 4s on a side, you cannot move further in that touching direction until you have clearance.\n  - Practically: navigate corridors “between the 4s”.\n\n# KEYS, EXIT, AND HOW TO FIND THEM\n* The EXIT contains (or is adjacent to) the target key pattern and is marked by nearby 5s (it need not be fully surrounded; any 5s strongly indicate the exit region).\n* The bottom-left of the entire grid shows the REQUIRED KEY BLUEPRINT you must match: a specific layout of 0s (white) and 9s (blue).\n* Key generation mechanism (explicit):\n  - The KEY GENERATOR is a field/patch consisting of 0s and 9s that is NOT surrounded by 5s (i.e., not the exit).\n  - When any part of your 8×8 player walks onto this patch, a NEW candidate key is generated and displayed in the bottom-left.\n  - Step OFF the patch and then back ON to generate yet another candidate key; repeat to cycle through possibilities.\n  - You must keep cycling until the bottom-left candidate key EXACTLY matches the exit’s key (the same distribution of 0s and 9s seen within/adjacent to the 5s).\n* A reliable way to locate both the EXIT and the KEY GENERATOR area:\n  - Look for clusters of 0s and 9s reachable via 3s; if they are NOT framed by 5s, that area is most likely the generator. If you see 5s nearby framing a matching 0/9 pattern, that marks the exit.\n* When the pattern shown in the bottom-left matches the arrangement of 0s and 9s you see framed by (or adjacent to) 5s at the exit, move toward the 5s to complete the level.\n\n# HUD / PROGRESSION\n* Visual score on the second-to-last grid row (row 62): it contains several 4-cell “slots”.\n  - Slots made of 3s represent UNFINISHED levels.\n  - When a slot changes from 3s to another color, that level is COMPLETE.\n* Track remaining MOVES/ENERGY by counting tiles with value 15.\n* Track LIVES by counting distinct 2×2 blocks of 8s.\n\n# GENERAL NOTES\n* The grid is a bird’s-eye view.\n* If the grid does not change after an action, you likely attempted an illegal move into 4s.\n* Favor routes marked by 3s; scan for 0/9 patches (generator) and confirm exit by nearby 5s; confirm the key by matching the bottom-left blueprint of 0s/9s.\n\n# EXAMPLE STRATEGY OBSERVATION\nThe 8×8 player (top rows 12s, bottom rows 9s) is flush against 4s on the left, so LEFT is blocked. I can see a 0/9 patch reachable via 3s to the right (likely the generator) and some 5s beyond it, so I should move RIGHT toward that corridor, cycling the key on the generator until the bottom-left key matches the one at the exit.\n\n# TURN:\nCall exactly one action.\n"

    "content": "\n# CONTEXT:\nYou are an agent playing a dynamic game. Your objective is to\nWIN and avoid GAME_OVER while minimizing actions.\n\nOne action produces one Frame. One Frame is made of one or more sequential\nGrids. Each Grid is a matrix size INT<0,63> by INT<0,63> filled with\nINT<0,15> values. Each value represents a different color and usually implies a different object.\n\nYou are playing a game called LockSmith.\n\n# CONTROLS\n* RESET: start over\n* ACTION1: move up\n* ACTION2: move down\n* ACTION3: move left\n* ACTION4: move right\n* ACTION5/ACTION6: no-ops\n\n# GOAL\nFind/generate a key that MATCHES the key pattern shown at the EXIT, then navigate to the EXIT to finish the level.\nThere are 6 levels total. Complete all levels to WIN.\n\n# TILE MEANINGS (important ones)\n* 0 = white cell (used in key patterns)\n* 3 = walkable path / corridor marker (often outlines routes to key/exit)\n* 4 = WALL (solid). You cannot enter 4s.\n* 5 = EXIT indicator (presence of 5s marks/frames the exit area)\n* 8 = LIFE token (count lives as the number of 2×2 blocks of 8s)\n* 9 = blue cells (used in player lower body; also appear elsewhere in the map and in key logic)\n* 12 = orange cells (used in player upper body)\n* 15 = MOVE counter (number of 15s ≈ moves/energy left)\n\n# PLAYER (sprite + movement legality)\n* The player is an 8×8 sprite made ONLY of 12s (top two rows) over 9s (bottom six rows).\n  - Concretely: rows 0–1 (relative to the sprite) are all 12s; rows 2–7 are all 9s.\n  - Other scattered 9s on the board are NOT the player—only the exact 8×8 (2×8 of 12s stacked on 6×8 of 9s) is the player.\n* Movement rules:\n  - You may move only through non-4 cells (i.e., never overlap a 4 after a move).\n  - If any part of your 8×8 sprite would overlap a 4 in the target direction (including cases where 4s lie “under” 9s), that move is ILLEGAL.\n  - If your sprite is already touching 4s on a side, you cannot move further in that touching direction until you have clearance.\n  - Practically: navigate corridors “between the 4s”.\n\n# KEYS, EXIT, AND HOW TO FIND THEM\n* The EXIT contains (or is adjacent to) the target key pattern and is marked by nearby 5s (it need not be fully surrounded; any 5s strongly indicate the exit region).\n* The bottom-left of the entire grid shows the REQUIRED KEY BLUEPRINT you must match: a specific layout of 0s (white) and 9s (blue).\n* Key generation mechanism (explicit):\n  - The KEY GENERATOR is a field/patch consisting of 0s and 9s that is NOT surrounded by 5s (i.e., not the exit).\n  - When any part of your 8×8 player walks onto this patch, a NEW candidate key is generated and displayed in the bottom-left.\n  - Step OFF the patch and then back ON to generate yet another candidate key; repeat to cycle through possibilities.\n  - You must keep cycling until the bottom-left candidate key EXACTLY matches the exit’s key (the same distribution of 0s and 9s seen within/adjacent to the 5s).\n* A reliable way to locate both the EXIT and the KEY GENERATOR area:\n  - Look for clusters of 0s and 9s reachable via 3s; if they are NOT framed by 5s, that area is most likely the generator. If you see 5s nearby framing a matching 0/9 pattern, that marks the exit.\n* When the pattern shown in the bottom-left matches the arrangement of 0s and 9s you see framed by (or adjacent to) 5s at the exit, move toward the 5s to complete the level.\n\n# HUD / PROGRESSION\n* Visual score on the second-to-last grid row (row 62): it contains several 4-cell “slots”.\n  - Slots made of 3s represent UNFINISHED levels.\n  - When a slot changes from 3s to another color, that level is COMPLETE.\n* Track remaining MOVES/ENERGY by counting tiles with value 15.\n* Track LIVES by counting distinct 2×2 blocks of 8s.\n\n# GENERAL NOTES\n* The grid is a bird’s-eye view.\n* If the grid does not change after an action, you likely attempted an illegal move into 4s.\n* Favor routes marked by 3s; scan for 0/9 patches (generator) and confirm exit by nearby 5s; confirm the key by matching the bottom-left blueprint of 0s/9s.\n\n# EXAMPLE STRATEGY OBSERVATION\nThe 8×8 player (top rows 12s, bottom rows 9s) is flush against 4s on the left, so LEFT is blocked. I can see a 0/9 patch reachable via 3s to the right (likely the generator) and some 5s beyond it, so I should move RIGHT toward that corridor, cycling the key on the generator until the bottom-left key matches the one at the exit.\n\n# TURN:\nCall exactly one action.\n"

I can see a large 0/9 patch down-left (not framed by 5s) — that looks like the key generator — and the exit (framed by 5s) is not visible yet.

    "content": "\n# CONTEXT:\nYou are an agent playing a dynamic game. Your objective is to\nWIN and avoid GAME_OVER while minimizing actions.\n\nOne action produces one Frame. One Frame is made of one or more sequential\nGrids. Each Grid is a matrix size INT<0,63> by INT<0,63> filled with\nINT<0,15> values. Each value represents a different color and usually implies a different object.\n\nYou are playing a game called LockSmith.\n\n# CONTROLS\n* RESET: start over\n* ACTION1: move up\n* ACTION2: move down\n* ACTION3: move left\n* ACTION4: move right\n* ACTION5/ACTION6: no-ops\n\n# GOAL\nFind/generate a key that MATCHES the key pattern shown at the EXIT, then navigate to the EXIT to finish the level.\nThere are 6 levels total. Complete all levels to WIN.\n\n# TILE MEANINGS (important ones)\n* 0 = white cell (used in key patterns)\n* 3 = walkable path / corridor marker (often outlines routes to key/exit)\n* 4 = WALL (solid). You cannot enter 4s.\n* 5 = EXIT indicator (presence of 5s marks/frames the exit area)\n* 8 = LIFE token (count lives as the number of 2×2 blocks of 8s)\n* 9 = blue cells (used in player lower body; also appear elsewhere in the map and in key logic)\n* 12 = orange cells (used in player upper body)\n* 15 = MOVE counter (number of 15s ≈ moves/energy left)\n\n# PLAYER (sprite + movement legality)\n* The player is an 8×8 sprite made ONLY of 12s (top two rows) over 9s (bottom six rows).\n  - Concretely: rows 0–1 (relative to the sprite) are all 12s; rows 2–7 are all 9s.\n  - Other scattered 9s on the board are NOT the player—only the exact 8×8 (2×8 of 12s stacked on 6×8 of 9s) is the player.\n* Movement rules:\n  - You may move only through non-4 cells (i.e., never overlap a 4 after a move).\n  - If any part of your 8×8 sprite would overlap a 4 in the target direction (including cases where 4s lie “under” 9s), that move is ILLEGAL.\n  - If your sprite is already touching 4s on a side, you cannot move further in that touching direction until you have clearance.\n  - Practically: navigate corridors “between the 4s”.\n\n# KEYS, EXIT, AND HOW TO FIND THEM\n* The EXIT contains (or is adjacent to) the target key pattern and is marked by nearby 5s (it need not be fully surrounded; any 5s strongly indicate the exit region).\n* The bottom-left of the entire grid shows the REQUIRED KEY BLUEPRINT you must match: a specific layout of 0s (white) and 9s (blue).\n* Key generation mechanism (explicit):\n  - The KEY GENERATOR is a field/patch consisting of 0s and 9s that is NOT surrounded by 5s (i.e., not the exit).\n  - When any part of your 8×8 player walks onto this patch, a NEW candidate key is generated and displayed in the bottom-left.\n  - Step OFF the patch and then back ON to generate yet another candidate key; repeat to cycle through possibilities.\n  - You must keep cycling until the bottom-left candidate key EXACTLY matches the exit’s key (the same distribution of 0s and 9s seen within/adjacent to the 5s).\n* A reliable way to locate both the EXIT and the KEY GENERATOR area:\n  - Look for clusters of 0s and 9s reachable via 3s; if they are NOT framed by 5s, that area is most likely the generator. If you see 5s nearby framing a matching 0/9 pattern, that marks the exit.\n* When the pattern shown in the bottom-left matches the arrangement of 0s and 9s you see framed by (or adjacent to) 5s at the exit, move toward the 5s to complete the level.\n\n# HUD / PROGRESSION\n* Visual score on the second-to-last grid row (row 62): it contains several 4-cell “slots”.\n  - Slots made of 3s represent UNFINISHED levels.\n  - When a slot changes from 3s to another color, that level is COMPLETE.\n* Track remaining MOVES/ENERGY by counting tiles with value 15.\n* Track LIVES by counting distinct 2×2 blocks of 8s.\n\n# GENERAL NOTES\n* The grid is a bird’s-eye view.\n* If the grid does not change after an action, you likely attempted an illegal move into 4s.\n* Favor routes marked by 3s; scan for 0/9 patches (generator) and confirm exit by nearby 5s; confirm the key by matching the bottom-left blueprint of 0s/9s.\n\n# EXAMPLE STRATEGY OBSERVATION\nThe 8×8 player (top rows 12s, bottom rows 9s) is flush against 4s on the left, so LEFT is blocked. I can see a 0/9 patch reachable via 3s to the right (likely the generator) and some 5s beyond it, so I should move RIGHT toward that corridor, cycling the key on the generator until the bottom-left key matches the one at the exit.\n\n# TURN:\nCall exactly one action.\n"

Ahead and slightly up/right there is an open room with 5s framing the exit and a 0/9 pattern visible inside that framed area (the exit key). A separate generator-like patch of 0s/9s lies further down/left in the map; to reach the framed exit area I should advance up (and then right along the 3s corridor) toward the 5s."

    "content": "\n# CONTEXT:\nYou are an agent playing a dynamic game. Your objective is to\nWIN and avoid GAME_OVER while minimizing actions.\n\nOne action produces one Frame. One Frame is made of one or more sequential\nGrids. Each Grid is a matrix size INT<0,63> by INT<0,63> filled with\nINT<0,15> values. Each value represents a different color and usually implies a different object.\n\nYou are playing a game called LockSmith.\n\n# CONTROLS\n* RESET: start over\n* ACTION1: move up\n* ACTION2: move down\n* ACTION3: move left\n* ACTION4: move right\n* ACTION5/ACTION6: no-ops\n\n# GOAL\nFind/generate a key that MATCHES the key pattern shown at the EXIT, then navigate to the EXIT to finish the level.\nThere are 6 levels total. Complete all levels to WIN.\n\n# TILE MEANINGS (important ones)\n* 0 = white cell (used in key patterns)\n* 3 = walkable path / corridor marker (often outlines routes to key/exit)\n* 4 = WALL (solid). You cannot enter 4s.\n* 5 = EXIT indicator (presence of 5s marks/frames the exit area)\n* 8 = LIFE token (count lives as the number of 2×2 blocks of 8s)\n* 9 = blue cells (used in player lower body; also appear elsewhere in the map and in key logic)\n* 12 = orange cells (used in player upper body)\n* 15 = MOVE counter (number of 15s ≈ moves/energy left)\n\n# PLAYER (sprite + movement legality)\n* The player is an 8×8 sprite made ONLY of 12s (top two rows) over 9s (bottom six rows).\n  - Concretely: rows 0–1 (relative to the sprite) are all 12s; rows 2–7 are all 9s.\n  - Other scattered 9s on the board are NOT the player—only the exact 8×8 (2×8 of 12s stacked on 6×8 of 9s) is the player.\n* Movement rules:\n  - You may move only through non-4 cells (i.e., never overlap a 4 after a move).\n  - If any part of your 8×8 sprite would overlap a 4 in the target direction (including cases where 4s lie “under” 9s), that move is ILLEGAL.\n  - If your sprite is already touching 4s on a side, you cannot move further in that touching direction until you have clearance.\n  - Practically: navigate corridors “between the 4s”.\n\n# KEYS, EXIT, AND HOW TO FIND THEM\n* The EXIT contains (or is adjacent to) the target key pattern and is marked by nearby 5s (it need not be fully surrounded; any 5s strongly indicate the exit region).\n* The bottom-left of the entire grid shows the REQUIRED KEY BLUEPRINT you must match: a specific layout of 0s (white) and 9s (blue).\n* Key generation mechanism (explicit):\n  - The KEY GENERATOR is a field/patch consisting of 0s and 9s that is NOT surrounded by 5s (i.e., not the exit).\n  - When any part of your 8×8 player walks onto this patch, a NEW candidate key is generated and displayed in the bottom-left.\n  - Step OFF the patch and then back ON to generate yet another candidate key; repeat to cycle through possibilities.\n  - You must keep cycling until the bottom-left candidate key EXACTLY matches the exit’s key (the same distribution of 0s and 9s seen within/adjacent to the 5s).\n* A reliable way to locate both the EXIT and the KEY GENERATOR area:\n  - Look for clusters of 0s and 9s reachable via 3s; if they are NOT framed by 5s, that area is most likely the generator. If you see 5s nearby framing a matching 0/9 pattern, that marks the exit.\n* When the pattern shown in the bottom-left matches the arrangement of 0s and 9s you see framed by (or adjacent to) 5s at the exit, move toward the 5s to complete the level.\n\n# HUD / PROGRESSION\n* Visual score on the second-to-last grid row (row 62): it contains several 4-cell “slots”.\n  - Slots made of 3s represent UNFINISHED levels.\n  - When a slot changes from 3s to another color, that level is COMPLETE.\n* Track remaining MOVES/ENERGY by counting tiles with value 15.\n* Track LIVES by counting distinct 2×2 blocks of 8s.\n\n# GENERAL NOTES\n* The grid is a bird’s-eye view.\n* If the grid does not change after an action, you likely attempted an illegal move into 4s.\n* Favor routes marked by 3s; scan for 0/9 patches (generator) and confirm exit by nearby 5s; confirm the key by matching the bottom-left blueprint of 0s/9s.\n\n# EXAMPLE STRATEGY OBSERVATION\nThe 8×8 player (top rows 12s, bottom rows 9s) is flush against 4s on the left, so LEFT is blocked. I can see a 0/9 patch reachable via 3s to the right (likely the generator) and some 5s beyond it, so I should move RIGHT toward that corridor, cycling the key on the generator until the bottom-left key matches the one at the exit.\n\n# TURN:\nCall exactly one action.\n"

    "content": "\n# CONTEXT:\nYou are an agent playing a dynamic game. Your objective is to\nWIN and avoid GAME_OVER while minimizing actions.\n\nOne action produces one Frame. One Frame is made of one or more sequential\nGrids. Each Grid is a matrix size INT<0,63> by INT<0,63> filled with\nINT<0,15> values. Each value represents a different color and usually implies a different object.\n\nYou are playing a game called LockSmith.\n\n# CONTROLS\n* RESET: start over\n* ACTION1: move up\n* ACTION2: move down\n* ACTION3: move left\n* ACTION4: move right\n* ACTION5/ACTION6: no-ops\n\n# GOAL\nFind/generate a key that MATCHES the key pattern shown at the EXIT, then navigate to the EXIT to finish the level.\nThere are 6 levels total. Complete all levels to WIN.\n\n# TILE MEANINGS (important ones)\n* 0 = white cell (used in key patterns)\n* 3 = walkable path / corridor marker (often outlines routes to key/exit)\n* 4 = WALL (solid).

    "content": "\n# CONTEXT:\nYou are an agent playing a dynamic game. Your objective is to\nWIN and avoid GAME_OVER while minimizing actions.\n\nOne action produces one Frame. One Frame is made of one or more sequential\nGrids. Each Grid is a matrix size INT<0,63> by INT<0,63> filled with\nINT<0,15> values. Each value represents a different color and usually implies a different object.\n\nYou are playing a game called LockSmith.\n\n# CONTROLS\n* RESET: start over\n* ACTION1: move up\n* ACTION2: move down\n* ACTION3: move left\n* ACTION4: move right\n* ACTION5/ACTION6: no-ops\n\n# GOAL\nFind/generate a key that MATCHES the key pattern shown at the EXIT, then navigate to the EXIT to finish the level.\nThere are 6 levels total. Complete all levels to WIN.\n\n# TILE MEANINGS (important ones)\n* 0 = white cell (used in key patterns)\n* 3 = walkable path / corridor marker (often outlines routes to key/exit)\n* 4 = WALL (solid). You cannot enter 4s.\n* 5 = EXIT indicator (presence of 5s marks/frames the exit area)\n* 8 = LIFE token (count lives as the number of 2×2 blocks of 8s)\n* 9 = blue cells (used in player lower body; also appear elsewhere in the map and in key logic)\n* 12 = orange cells (used in player upper body)\n* 15 = MOVE counter (number of 15s ≈ moves/energy left)\n\n# PLAYER (sprite + movement legality)\n* The player is an 8×8 sprite made ONLY of 12s (top two rows) over 9s (bottom six rows).\n  - Concretely: rows 0–1 (relative to the sprite) are all 12s; rows 2–7 are all 9s.\n  - Other scattered 9s on the board are NOT the player—only the exact 8×8 (2×8 of 12s stacked on 6×8 of 9s) is the player.\n* Movement rules:\n  - You may move only through non-4 cells (i.e., never overlap a 4 after a move).\n  - If any part of your 8×8 sprite would overlap a 4 in the target direction (including cases where 4s lie “under” 9s), that move is ILLEGAL.\n  - If your sprite is already touching 4s on a side, you cannot move further in that touching direction until you have clearance.\n  - Practically: navigate corridors “between the 4s”.\n\n# KEYS, EXIT, AND HOW TO FIND THEM\n* The EXIT contains (or is adjacent to) the target key pattern and is marked by nearby 5s (it need not be fully surrounded; any 5s strongly indicate the exit region).\n* The bottom-left of the entire grid shows the REQUIRED KEY BLUEPRINT you must match: a specific layout of 0s (white) and 9s (blue).\n* Key generation mechanism (explicit):\n  - The KEY GENERATOR is a field/patch consisting of 0s and 9s that is NOT surrounded by 5s (i.e., not the exit).\n  - When any part of your 8×8 player walks onto this patch, a NEW candidate key is generated and displayed in the bottom-left.\n  - Step OFF the patch and then back ON to generate yet another candidate key; repeat to cycle through possibilities.\n  - You must keep cycling until the bottom-left candidate key EXACTLY matches the exit’s key (the same distribution of 0s and 9s seen within/adjacent to the 5s).\n* A reliable way to locate both the EXIT and the KEY GENERATOR area:\n  - Look for clusters of 0s and 9s reachable via 3s; if they are NOT framed by 5s, that area is most likely the generator. If you see 5s nearby framing a matching 0/9 pattern, that marks the exit.\n* When the pattern shown in the bottom-left matches the arrangement of 0s and 9s you see framed by (or adjacent to) 5s at the exit, move toward the 5s to complete the level.\n\n# HUD / PROGRESSION\n* Visual score on the second-to-last grid row (row 62): it contains several 4-cell “slots”.\n  - Slots made of 3s represent UNFINISHED levels.\n  - When a slot changes from 3s to another color, that level is COMPLETE.\n* Track remaining MOVES/ENERGY by counting tiles with value 15.\n* Track LIVES by counting distinct 2×2 blocks of 8s.\n\n# GENERAL NOTES\n* The grid is a bird’s-eye view.\n* If the grid does not change after an action, you likely attempted an illegal move into 4s.\n* Favor routes marked by 3s; scan for 0/9 patches (generator) and confirm exit by nearby 5s; confirm the key by matching the bottom-left blueprint of 0s/9s.\n\n# EXAMPLE STRATEGY OBSERVATION\nThe 8×8 player (top rows 12s, bottom rows 9s) is flush against 4s on the left, so LEFT is blocked. I can see a 0/9 patch reachable via 3s to the right (likely the generator) and some 5s beyond it, so I should move RIGHT toward that corridor, cycling the key on the generator until the bottom-left key matches the one at the exit.\n\n# TURN:\nCall exactly one action.\n"

    "content": "\n# CONTEXT:\nYou are an agent playing a dynamic game. Your objective is to\nWIN and avoid GAME_OVER while minimizing actions.\n\nOne action produces one Frame. One Frame is made of one or more sequential\nGrids. Each Grid is a matrix size INT<0,63> by INT<0,63> filled with\nINT<0,15> values. Each value represents a different color and usually implies a different object.\n\nYou are playing a game called LockSmith.\n\n# CONTROLS\n* RESET: start over\n* ACTION1: move up\n* ACTION2: move down\n* ACTION3: move left\n* ACTION4: move right\n* ACTION5/ACTION6: no-ops\n\n# GOAL\nFind/generate a key that MATCHES the key pattern shown at the EXIT, then navigate to the EXIT to finish the level.\nThere are 6 levels total. Complete all levels to WIN.\n\n# TILE MEANINGS (important ones)\n* 0 = white cell (used in key patterns)\n* 3 = walkable path / corridor marker (often outlines routes to key/exit)\n* 4 = WALL (solid). You cannot enter 4s.\n* 5 = EXIT indicator (presence of 5s marks/frames the exit area)\n* 8 = LIFE token (count lives as the number of 2×2 blocks of 8s)\n* 9 = blue cells (used in player lower body; also appear elsewhere in the map and in key logic)\n* 12 = orange cells (used in player upper body)\n* 15 = MOVE counter (number of 15s ≈ moves/energy left)\n\n# PLAYER (sprite + movement legality)\n* The player is an 8×8 sprite made ONLY of 12s (top two rows) over 9s (bottom six rows).\n  - Concretely: rows 0–1 (relative to the sprite) are all 12s; rows 2–7 are all 9s.\n  - Other scattered 9s on the board are NOT the player—only the exact 8×8 (2×8 of 12s stacked on 6×8 of 9s) is the player.\n* Movement rules:\n  - You may move only through non-4 cells (i.e., never overlap a 4 after a move).\n  - If any part of your 8×8 sprite would overlap a 4 in the target direction (including cases where 4s lie “under” 9s), that move is ILLEGAL.\n  - If your sprite is already touching 4s on a side, you cannot move further in that touching direction until you have clearance.\n  - Practically: navigate corridors “between the 4s”.\n\n# KEYS, EXIT, AND HOW TO FIND THEM\n* The EXIT contains (or is adjacent to) the target key pattern and is marked by nearby 5s (it need not be fully surrounded; any 5s strongly indicate the exit region).\n* The bottom-left of the entire grid shows the REQUIRED KEY BLUEPRINT you must match: a specific layout of 0s (white) and 9s (blue).\n* Key generation mechanism (explicit):\n  - The KEY GENERATOR is a field/patch consisting of 0s and 9s that is NOT surrounded by 5s (i.e., not the exit).\n  - When any part of your 8×8 player walks onto this patch, a NEW candidate key is generated and displayed in the bottom-left.\n  - Step OFF the patch and then back ON to generate yet another candidate key; repeat to cycle through possibilities.\n  - You must keep cycling until the bottom-left candidate key EXACTLY matches the exit’s key (the same distribution of 0s and 9s seen within/adjacent to the 5s).\n* A reliable way to locate both the EXIT and the KEY GENERATOR area:\n  - Look for clusters of 0s and 9s reachable via 3s; if they are NOT framed by 5s, that area is most likely the generator. If you see 5s nearby framing a matching 0/9 pattern, that marks the exit.\n* When the pattern shown in the bottom-left matches the arrangement of 0s and 9s you see framed by (or adjacent to) 5s at the exit, move toward the 5s to complete the level.\n\n# HUD / PROGRESSION\n* Visual score on the second-to-last grid row (row 62): it contains several 4-cell “slots”.\n  - Slots made of 3s represent UNFINISHED levels.\n  - When a slot changes from 3s to another color, that level is COMPLETE.\n* Track remaining MOVES/ENERGY by counting tiles with value 15.\n* Track LIVES by counting distinct 2×2 blocks of 8s.\n\n# GENERAL NOTES\n* The grid is a bird’s-eye view.\n* If the grid does not change after an action, you likely attempted an illegal move into 4s.\n* Favor routes marked by 3s; scan for 0/9 patches (generator) and confirm exit by nearby 5s; confirm the key by matching the bottom-left blueprint of 0s/9s.\n\n# EXAMPLE STRATEGY OBSERVATION\nThe 8×8 player (top rows 12s, bottom rows 9s) is flush against 4s on the left, so LEFT is blocked. I can see a 0/9 patch reachable via 3s to the right (likely the generator) and some 5s beyond it, so I should move RIGHT toward that corridor, cycling the key on the generator until the bottom-left key matches the one at the exit.\n\n# TURN:\nCall exactly one action.\n"

    "content": "\n# CONTEXT:\nYou are an agent playing a dynamic game. Your objective is to\nWIN and avoid GAME_OVER while minimizing actions.\n\nOne action produces one Frame. One Frame is made of one or more sequential\nGrids. Each Grid is a matrix size INT<0,63> by INT<0,63> filled with\nINT<0,15> values. Each value represents a different color and usually implies a different object.\n\nYou are playing a game called LockSmith.\n\n# CONTROLS\n* RESET: start over\n* ACTION1: move up\n* ACTION2: move down\n* ACTION3: move left\n* ACTION4: move right\n* ACTION5/ACTION6: no-ops\n\n# GOAL\nFind/generate a key that MATCHES the key pattern shown at the EXIT, then navigate to the EXIT to finish the level.\nThere are 6 levels total. Complete all levels to WIN.\n\n# TILE MEANINGS (important ones)\n* 0 = white cell (used in key patterns)\n* 3 = walkable path / corridor marker (often outlines routes to key/exit)\n* 4 = WALL (solid). You cannot enter 4s.\n* 5 = EXIT indicator (presence of 5s marks/frames the exit area)\n* 8 = LIFE token (count lives as the number of 2×2 blocks of 8s)\n* 9 = blue cells (used in player lower body; also appear elsewhere in the map and in key logic)\n* 12 = orange cells (used in player upper body)\n* 15 = MOVE counter (number of 15s ≈ moves/energy left)\n\n# PLAYER (sprite + movement legality)\n* The player is an 8×8 sprite made ONLY of 12s (top two rows) over 9s (bottom six rows).\n  - Concretely: rows 0–1 (relative to the sprite) are all 12s; rows 2–7 are all 9s.\n  - Other scattered 9s on the board are NOT the player—only the exact 8×8 (2×8 of 12s stacked on 6×8 of 9s) is the player.\n* Movement rules:\n  - You may move only through non-4 cells (i.e., never overlap a 4 after a move).\n  - If any part of your 8×8 sprite would overlap a 4 in the target direction (including cases where 4s lie “under” 9s), that move is ILLEGAL.\n  - If your sprite is already touching 4s on a side, you cannot move further in that touching direction until you have clearance.\n  - Practically: navigate corridors “between the 4s”.\n\n# KEYS, EXIT, AND HOW TO FIND THEM\n* The EXIT contains (or is adjacent to) the target key pattern and is marked by nearby 5s (it need not be fully surrounded; any 5s strongly indicate the exit region).\n* The bottom-left of the entire grid shows the REQUIRED KEY BLUEPRINT you must match: a specific layout of 0s (white) and 9s (blue).\n* Key generation mechanism (explicit):\n  - The KEY GENERATOR is a field/patch consisting of 0s and 9s that is NOT surrounded by 5s (i.e., not the exit).\n  - When any part of your 8×8 player walks onto this patch, a NEW candidate key is generated and displayed in the bottom-left.\n  - Step OFF the patch and then back ON to generate yet another candidate key; repeat to cycle through possibilities.\n  - You must keep cycling until the bottom-left candidate key EXACTLY matches the exit’s key (the same distribution of 0s and 9s seen within/adjacent to the 5s).\n* A reliable way to locate both the EXIT and the KEY GENERATOR area:\n  - Look for clusters of 0s and 9s reachable via 3s; if they are NOT framed by 5s, that area is most likely the generator. If you see 5s nearby framing a matching 0/9 pattern, that marks the exit.\n* When the pattern shown in the bottom-left matches the arrangement of 0s and 9s you see framed by (or adjacent to) 5s at the exit, move toward the 5s to complete the level.\n\n# HUD / PROGRESSION\n* Visual score on the second-to-last grid row (row 62): it contains several 4-cell “slots”.\n  - Slots made of 3s represent UNFINISHED levels.\n  - When a slot changes from 3s to another color, that level is COMPLETE.\n* Track remaining MOVES/ENERGY by counting tiles with value 15.\n* Track LIVES by counting distinct 2×2 blocks of 8s.\n\n# GENERAL NOTES\n* The grid is a bird’s-eye view.\n* If the grid does not change after an action, you likely attempted an illegal move into 4s.\n* Favor routes marked by 3s; scan for 0/9 patches (generator) and confirm exit by nearby 5s; confirm the key by matching the bottom-left blueprint of 0s/9s.\n\n# EXAMPLE STRATEGY OBSERVATION\nThe 8×8 player (top rows 12s, bottom rows 9s) is flush against 4s on the left, so LEFT is blocked. I can see a 0/9 patch reachable via 3s to the right (likely the generator) and some 5s beyond it, so I should move RIGHT toward that corridor, cycling the key on the generator until the bottom-left key matches the one at the exit.\n\n# TURN:\nCall exactly one action.\n"

    "content": "\n# CONTEXT:\nYou are an agent playing a dynamic game. Your objective is to\nWIN and avoid GAME_OVER while minimizing actions.\n\nOne action produces one Frame. One Frame is made of one or more sequential\nGrids. Each Grid is a matrix size INT<0,63> by INT<0,63> filled with\nINT<0,15> values. Each value represents a different color and usually implies a different object.\n\nYou are playing a game called LockSmith.\n\n# CONTROLS\n* RESET: start over\n* ACTION1: move up\n* ACTION2: move down\n* ACTION3: move left\n* ACTION4: move right\n* ACTION5/ACTION6: no-ops\n\n# GOAL\nFind/generate a key that MATCHES the key pattern shown at the EXIT, then navigate to the EXIT to finish the level.\nThere are 6 levels total. Complete all levels to WIN.\n\n# TILE MEANINGS (important ones)\n* 0 = white cell (used in key patterns)\n* 3 = walkable path / corridor marker (often outlines routes to key/exit)\n* 4 = WALL (solid). You cannot enter 4s.\n* 5 = EXIT indicator (presence of 5s marks/frames the exit area)\n* 8 = LIFE token (count lives as the number of 2×2 blocks of 8s)\n* 9 = blue cells (used in player lower body; also appear elsewhere in the map and in key logic)\n* 12 = orange cells (used in player upper body)\n* 15 = MOVE counter (number of 15s ≈ moves/energy left)\n\n# PLAYER (sprite + movement legality)\n* The player is an 8×8 sprite made ONLY of 12s (top two rows) over 9s (bottom six rows).\n  - Concretely: rows 0–1 (relative to the sprite) are all 12s; rows 2–7 are all 9s.\n  - Other scattered 9s on the board are NOT the player—only the exact 8×8 (2×8 of 12s stacked on 6×8 of 9s) is the player.\n* Movement rules:\n  - You may move only through non-4 cells (i.e., never overlap a 4 after a move).\n  - If any part of your 8×8 sprite would overlap a 4 in the target direction (including cases where 4s lie “under” 9s), that move is ILLEGAL.\n  - If your sprite is already touching 4s on a side, you cannot move further in that touching direction until you have clearance.\n  - Practically: navigate corridors “between the 4s”.\n\n# KEYS, EXIT, AND HOW TO FIND THEM\n* The EXIT contains (or is adjacent to) the target key pattern and is marked by nearby 5s (it need not be fully surrounded; any 5s strongly indicate the exit region).\n* The bottom-left of the entire grid shows the REQUIRED KEY BLUEPRINT you must match: a specific layout of 0s (white) and 9s (blue).\n* Key generation mechanism (explicit):\n  - The KEY GENERATOR is a field/patch consisting of 0s and 9s that is NOT surrounded by 5s (i.e., not the exit).\n  - When any part of your 8×8 player walks onto this patch, a NEW candidate key is generated and displayed in the bottom-left.\n  - Step OFF the patch and then back ON to generate yet another candidate key; repeat to cycle through possibilities.\n  - You must keep cycling until the bottom-left candidate key EXACTLY matches the exit’s key (the same distribution of 0s and 9s seen within/adjacent to the 5s).\n* A reliable way to locate both the EXIT and the KEY GENERATOR area:\n  - Look for clusters of 0s and 9s reachable via 3s; if they are NOT framed by 5s, that area is most likely the generator. If you see 5s nearby framing a matching 0/9 pattern, that marks the exit.\n* When the pattern shown in the bottom-left matches the arrangement of 0s and 9s you see framed by (or adjacent to) 5s at the exit, move toward the 5s to complete the level.\n\n# HUD / PROGRESSION\n* Visual score on the second-to-last grid row (row 62): it contains several 4-cell “slots”.\n  - Slots made of 3s represent UNFINISHED levels.\n  - When a slot changes from 3s to another color, that level is COMPLETE.\n* Track remaining MOVES/ENERGY by counting tiles with value 15.\n* Track LIVES by counting distinct 2×2 blocks of 8s.\n\n# GENERAL NOTES\n* The grid is a bird’s-eye view.\n* If the grid does not change after an action, you likely attempted an illegal move into 4s.\n* Favor routes marked by 3s; scan for 0/9 patches (generator) and confirm exit by nearby 5s; confirm the key by matching the bottom-left blueprint of 0s/9s.\n\n# EXAMPLE STRATEGY OBSERVATION\nThe 8×8 player (top rows 12s, bottom rows 9s) is flush against 4s on the left, so LEFT is blocked. I can see a 0/9 patch reachable via 3s to the right (likely the generator) and some 5s beyond it, so I should move RIGHT toward that corridor, cycling the key on the generator until the bottom-left key matches the one at the exit.\n\n# TURN:\nCall exactly one action.\n"

    "content": "\n# CONTEXT:\nYou are an agent playing a dynamic game. Your objective is to\nWIN and avoid GAME_OVER while minimizing actions.\n\nOne action produces one Frame. One Frame is made of one or more sequential\nGrids. Each Grid is a matrix size INT<0,63> by INT<0,63> filled with\nINT<0,15> values. Each value represents a different color and usually implies a different object.\n\nYou are playing a game called LockSmith.\n\n# CONTROLS\n* RESET: start over\n* ACTION1: move up\n* ACTION2: move down\n* ACTION3: move left\n* ACTION4: move right\n* ACTION5/ACTION6: no-ops\n\n# GOAL\nFind/generate a key that MATCHES the key pattern shown at the EXIT, then navigate to the EXIT to finish the level.\nThere are 6 levels total. Complete all levels to WIN.\n\n# TILE MEANINGS (important ones)\n* 0 = white cell (used in key patterns)\n* 3 = walkable path / corridor marker (often outlines routes to key/exit)\n* 4 = WALL (solid). You cannot enter 4s.\n* 5 = EXIT indicator (presence of 5s marks/frames the exit area)\n* 8 = LIFE token (count lives as the number of 2×2 blocks of 8s)\n* 9 = blue cells (used in player lower body; also appear elsewhere in the map and in key logic)\n* 12 = orange cells (used in player upper body)\n* 15 = MOVE counter (number of 15s ≈ moves/energy left)\n\n# PLAYER (sprite + movement legality)\n* The player is an 8×8 sprite made ONLY of 12s (top two rows) over 9s (bottom six rows).\n  - Concretely: rows 0–1 (relative to the sprite) are all 12s; rows 2–7 are all 9s.\n  - Other scattered 9s on the board are NOT the player—only the exact 8×8 (2×8 of 12s stacked on 6×8 of 9s) is the player.\n* Movement rules:\n  - You may move only through non-4 cells (i.e., never overlap a 4 after a move).\n  - If any part of your 8×8 sprite would overlap a 4 in the target direction (including cases where 4s lie “under” 9s), that move is ILLEGAL.\n  - If your sprite is already touching 4s on a side, you cannot move further in that touching direction until you have clearance.\n  - Practically: navigate corridors “between the 4s”.\n\n# KEYS, EXIT, AND HOW TO FIND THEM\n* The EXIT contains (or is adjacent to) the target key pattern and is marked by nearby 5s (it need not be fully surrounded; any 5s strongly indicate the exit region).\n* The bottom-left of the entire grid shows the REQUIRED KEY BLUEPRINT you must match: a specific layout of 0s (white) and 9s (blue).\n* Key generation mechanism (explicit):\n  - The KEY GENERATOR is a field/patch consisting of 0s and 9s that is NOT surrounded by 5s (i.e., not the exit).\n  - When any part of your 8×8 player walks onto this patch, a NEW candidate key is generated and displayed in the bottom-left.\n  - Step OFF the patch and then back ON to generate yet another candidate key; repeat to cycle through possibilities.\n  - You must keep cycling until the bottom-left candidate key EXACTLY matches the exit’s key (the same distribution of 0s and 9s seen within/adjacent to the 5s).\n* A reliable way to locate both the EXIT and the KEY GENERATOR area:\n  - Look for clusters of 0s and 9s reachable via 3s; if they are NOT framed by 5s, that area is most likely the generator. If you see 5s nearby framing a matching 0/9 pattern, that marks the exit.\n* When the pattern shown in the bottom-left matches the arrangement of 0s and 9s you see framed by (or adjacent to) 5s at the exit, move toward the 5s to complete the level.\n\n# HUD / PROGRESSION\n* Visual score on the second-to-last grid row (row 62): it contains several 4-cell “slots”.\n  - Slots made of 3s represent UNFINISHED levels.\n  - When a slot changes from 3s to another color, that level is COMPLETE.\n* Track remaining MOVES/ENERGY by counting tiles with value 15.\n* Track LIVES by counting distinct 2×2 blocks of 8s.\n\n# GENERAL NOTES\n* The grid is a bird’s-eye view.\n* If the grid does not change after an action, you likely attempted an illegal move into 4s.\n* Favor routes marked by 3s; scan for 0/9 patches (generator) and confirm exit by nearby 5s; confirm the key by matching the bottom-left blueprint of 0s/9s.\n\n# EXAMPLE STRATEGY OBSERVATION\nThe 8×8 player (top rows 12s, bottom rows 9s) is flush against 4s on the left, so LEFT is blocked. I can see a 0/9 patch reachable via 3s to the right (likely the generator) and some 5s beyond it, so I should move RIGHT toward that corridor, cycling the key on the generator until the bottom-left key matches the one at the exit.\n\n# TURN:\nCall exactly one action.\n"

Down the narrow corridor to the right/through the 3s there’s a separate 0/9 patch that is NOT surrounded by 5s (the key generator). Plan: enter the generator patch to cycle candidate keys until the bottom-left blueprint matches the 5-framed exit pattern, then return into the 5s to complete the level.

    "content": "\n# CONTEXT:\nYou are an agent playing a dynamic game. Your objective is to\nWIN and avoid GAME_OVER while minimizing actions.\n\nOne action produces one Frame. One Frame is made of one or more sequential\nGrids. Each Grid is a matrix size INT<0,63> by INT<0,63> filled with\nINT<0,15> values. Each value represents a different color and usually implies a different object.\n\nYou are playing a game called LockSmith.\n\n# CONTROLS\n* RESET: start over\n* ACTION1: move up\n* ACTION2: move down\n* ACTION3: move left\n* ACTION4: move right\n* ACTION5/ACTION6: no-ops\n\n# GOAL\nFind/generate a key that MATCHES the key pattern shown at the EXIT, then navigate to the EXIT to finish the level.\nThere are 6 levels total. Complete all levels to WIN.\n\n# TILE MEANINGS (important ones)\n* 0 = white cell (used in key patterns)\n* 3 = walkable path / corridor marker (often outlines routes to key/exit)\n* 4 = WALL (solid). You cannot enter 4s.\n* 5 = EXIT indicator (presence of 5s marks/frames the exit area)\n* 8 = LIFE token (count lives as the number of 2×2 blocks of 8s)\n* 9 = blue cells (used in player lower body; also appear elsewhere in the map and in key logic)\n* 12 = orange cells (used in player upper body)\n* 15 = MOVE counter (number of 15s ≈ moves/energy left)\n\n# PLAYER (sprite + movement legality)\n* The player is an 8×8 sprite made ONLY of 12s (top two rows) over 9s (bottom six rows).\n  - Concretely: rows 0–1 (relative to the sprite) are all 12s; rows 2–7 are all 9s.\n  - Other scattered 9s on the board are NOT the player—only the exact 8×8 (2×8 of 12s stacked on 6×8 of 9s) is the player.\n* Movement rules:\n  - You may move only through non-4 cells (i.e., never overlap a 4 after a move).\n  - If any part of your 8×8 sprite would overlap a 4 in the target direction (including cases where 4s lie “under” 9s), that move is ILLEGAL.\n  - If your sprite is already touching 4s on a side, you cannot move further in that touching direction until you have clearance.\n  - Practically: navigate corridors “between the 4s”.\n\n# KEYS, EXIT, AND HOW TO FIND THEM\n* The EXIT contains (or is adjacent to) the target key pattern and is marked by nearby 5s (it need not be fully surrounded; any 5s strongly indicate the exit region).\n* The bottom-left of the entire grid shows the REQUIRED KEY BLUEPRINT you must match: a specific layout of 0s (white) and 9s (blue).\n* Key generation mechanism (explicit):\n  - The KEY GENERATOR is a field/patch consisting of 0s and 9s that is NOT surrounded by 5s (i.e., not the exit).\n  - When any part of your 8×8 player walks onto this patch, a NEW candidate key is generated and displayed in the bottom-left.\n  - Step OFF the patch and then back ON to generate yet another candidate key; repeat to cycle through possibilities.\n  - You must keep cycling until the bottom-left candidate key EXACTLY matches the exit’s key (the same distribution of 0s and 9s seen within/adjacent to the 5s).\n* A reliable way to locate both the EXIT and the KEY GENERATOR area:\n  - Look for clusters of 0s and 9s reachable via 3s; if they are NOT framed by 5s, that area is most likely the generator. If you see 5s nearby framing a matching 0/9 pattern, that marks the exit.\n* When the pattern shown in the bottom-left matches the arrangement of 0s and 9s you see framed by (or adjacent to) 5s at the exit, move toward the 5s to complete the level.\n\n# HUD / PROGRESSION\n* Visual score on the second-to-last grid row (row 62): it contains several 4-cell “slots”.\n  - Slots made of 3s represent UNFINISHED levels.\n  - When a slot changes from 3s to another color, that level is COMPLETE.\n* Track remaining MOVES/ENERGY by counting tiles with value 15.\n* Track LIVES by counting distinct 2×2 blocks of 8s.\n\n# GENERAL NOTES\n* The grid is a bird’s-eye view.\n* If the grid does not change after an action, you likely attempted an illegal move into 4s.\n* Favor routes marked by 3s; scan for 0/9 patches (generator) and confirm exit by nearby 5s; confirm the key by matching the bottom-left blueprint of 0s/9s.\n\n# EXAMPLE STRATEGY OBSERVATION\nThe 8×8 player (top rows 12s, bottom rows 9s) is flush against 4s on the left, so LEFT is blocked. I can see a 0/9 patch reachable via 3s to the right (likely the generator) and some 5s beyond it, so I should move RIGHT toward that corridor, cycling the key on the generator until the bottom-left key matches the one at the exit.\n\n# TURN:\nCall exactly one action.\n"

If you see 5s nearby framing a matching 0/9 pattern, that marks the exit.\n* When the pattern shown in the bottom-left matches the arrangement of 0s and 9s you see framed by (or adjacent to) 5s at the exit, move toward the 5s to complete the level.\n\n# HUD / PROGRESSION\n* Visual score on the second-to-last grid row (row 62): it contains several 4-cell “slots”.\n  - Slots made of 3s represent UNFINISHED levels.\n  - When a slot changes from 3s to another color, that level is COMPLETE.\n* Track remaining MOVES/ENERGY by counting tiles with value 15.\n* Track LIVES by counting distinct 2×2 blocks of 8s.\n\n# GENERAL NOTES\n* The grid is a bird’s-eye view.\n* If the grid does not change after an action, you likely attempted an illegal move into 4s.\n* Favor routes marked by 3s; scan for 0/9 patches (generator) and confirm exit by nearby 5s; confirm the key by matching the bottom-left blueprint of 0s/9s.\n\n# EXAMPLE STRATEGY OBSERVATION\nThe 8×8 player (top rows 12s, bottom rows 9s) is flush against 4s on the left, so LEFT is blocked. I can see a 0/9 patch reachable via 3s to the right (likely the generator) and some 5s beyond it, so I should move RIGHT toward that corridor, cycling the key on the generator until the bottom-left key matches the one at the exit.\n\n# TURN:\nCall exactly one action.\n"

    "content": "\n# CONTEXT:\nYou are an agent playing a dynamic game. Your objective is to\nWIN and avoid GAME_OVER while minimizing actions.\n\nOne action produces one Frame. One Frame is made of one or more sequential\nGrids. Each Grid is a matrix size INT<0,63> by INT<0,63> filled with\nINT<0,15> values. Each value represents a different color and usually implies a different object.\n\nYou are playing a game called LockSmith.\n\n# CONTROLS\n* RESET: start over\n* ACTION1: move up\n* ACTION2: move down\n* ACTION3: move left\n* ACTION4: move right\n* ACTION5/ACTION6: no-ops\n\n# GOAL\nFind/generate a key that MATCHES the key pattern shown at the EXIT, then navigate to the EXIT to finish the level.\nThere are 6 levels total. Complete all levels to WIN.\n\n# TILE MEANINGS (important ones)\n* 0 = white cell (used in key patterns)\n* 3 = walkable path / corridor marker (often outlines routes to key/exit)\n* 4 = WALL (solid). You cannot enter 4s.\n* 5 = EXIT indicator (presence of 5s marks/frames the exit area)\n* 8 = LIFE token (count lives as the number of 2×2 blocks of 8s)\n* 9 = blue cells (used in player lower body; also appear elsewhere in the map and in key logic)\n* 12 = orange cells (used in player upper body)\n* 15 = MOVE counter (number of 15s ≈ moves/energy left)\n\n# PLAYER (sprite + movement legality)\n* The player is an 8×8 sprite made ONLY of 12s (top two rows) over 9s (bottom six rows).\n  - Concretely: rows 0–1 (relative to the sprite) are all 12s; rows 2–7 are all 9s.\n  - Other scattered 9s on the board are NOT the player—only the exact 8×8 (2×8 of 12s stacked on 6×8 of 9s) is the player.\n* Movement rules:\n  - You may move only through non-4 cells (i.e., never overlap a 4 after a move).\n  - If any part of your 8×8 sprite would overlap a 4 in the target direction (including cases where 4s lie “under” 9s), that move is ILLEGAL.\n  - If your sprite is already touching 4s on a side, you cannot move further in that touching direction until you have clearance.\n  - Practically: navigate corridors “between the 4s”.\n\n# KEYS, EXIT, AND HOW TO FIND THEM\n* The EXIT contains (or is adjacent to) the target key pattern and is marked by nearby 5s (it need not be fully surrounded; any 5s strongly indicate the exit region).\n* The bottom-left of the entire grid shows the REQUIRED KEY BLUEPRINT you must match: a specific layout of 0s (white) and 9s (blue).\n* Key generation mechanism (explicit):\n  - The KEY GENERATOR is a field/patch consisting of 0s and 9s that is NOT surrounded by 5s (i.e., not the exit).\n  - When any part of your 8×8 player walks onto this patch, a NEW candidate key is generated and displayed in the bottom-left.\n  - Step OFF the patch and then back ON to generate yet another candidate key; repeat to cycle through possibilities.\n  - You must keep cycling until the bottom-left candidate key EXACTLY matches the exit’s key (the same distribution of 0s and 9s seen within/adjacent to the 5s).\n* A reliable way to locate both the EXIT and the KEY GENERATOR area:\n  - Look for clusters of 0s and 9s reachable via 3s; if they are NOT framed by 5s, that area is most likely the generator. If you see 5s nearby framing a matching 0/9 pattern, that marks the exit.\n* When the pattern shown in the bottom-left matches the arrangement of 0s and 9s you see framed by (or adjacent to) 5s at the exit, move toward the 5s to complete the level.\n\n# HUD / PROGRESSION\n* Visual score on the second-to-last grid row (row 62): it contains several 4-cell “slots”.\n  - Slots made of 3s represent UNFINISHED levels.\n  - When a slot changes from 3s to another color, that level is COMPLETE.\n* Track remaining MOVES/ENERGY by counting tiles with value 15.\n* Track LIVES by counting distinct 2×2 blocks of 8s.\n\n# GENERAL NOTES\n* The grid is a bird’s-eye view.\n* If the grid does not change after an action, you likely attempted an illegal move into 4s.\n* Favor routes marked by 3s; scan for 0/9 patches (generator) and confirm exit by nearby 5s; confirm the key by matching the bottom-left blueprint of 0s/9s.\n\n# EXAMPLE STRATEGY OBSERVATION\nThe 8×8 player (top rows 12s, bottom rows 9s) is flush against 4s on the left, so LEFT is blocked. I can see a 0/9 patch reachable via 3s to the right (likely the generator) and some 5s beyond it, so I should move RIGHT toward that corridor, cycling the key on the generator until the bottom-left key matches the one at the exit.\n\n# TURN:\nCall exactly one action.\n"

One Frame is made of one or more sequential\nGrids. Each Grid is a matrix size INT<0,63> by INT<0,63> filled with\nINT<0,15> values. Each value represents a different color and usually implies a different object.\n\nYou are playing a game called LockSmith.\n\n# CONTROLS\n* RESET: start over\n* ACTION1: move up\n* ACTION2: move down\n* ACTION3: move left\n* ACTION4: move right\n* ACTION5/ACTION6: no-ops\n\n# GOAL\nFind/generate a key that MATCHES the key pattern shown at the EXIT, then navigate to the EXIT to finish the level.\nThere are 6 levels total. Complete all levels to WIN.\n\n# TILE MEANINGS (important ones)\n* 0 = white cell (used in key patterns)\n* 3 = walkable path / corridor marker (often outlines routes to key/exit)\n* 4 = WALL (solid). You cannot enter 4s.\n* 5 = EXIT indicator (presence of 5s marks/frames the exit area)\n* 8 = LIFE token (count lives as the number of 2×2 blocks of 8s)\n* 9 = blue cells (used in player lower body; also appear elsewhere in the map and in key logic)\n* 12 = orange cells (used in player upper body)\n* 15 = MOVE counter (number of 15s ≈ moves/energy left)\n\n# PLAYER (sprite + movement legality)\n* The player is an 8×8 sprite made ONLY of 12s (top two rows) over 9s (bottom six rows).\n  - Concretely: rows 0–1 (relative to the sprite) are all 12s; rows 2–7 are all 9s.\n  - Other scattered 9s on the board are NOT the player—only the exact 8×8 (2×8 of 12s stacked on 6×8 of 9s) is the player.\n* Movement rules:\n  - You may move only through non-4 cells (i.e., never overlap a 4 after a move).\n  - If any part of your 8×8 sprite would overlap a 4 in the target direction (including cases where 4s lie “under” 9s), that move is ILLEGAL.\n  - If your sprite is already touching 4s on a side, you cannot move further in that touching direction until you have clearance.\n  - Practically: navigate corridors “between the 4s”.\n\n# KEYS, EXIT, AND HOW TO FIND THEM\n* The EXIT contains (or is adjacent to) the target key pattern and is marked by nearby 5s (it need not be fully surrounded; any 5s strongly indicate the exit region).\n* The bottom-left of the entire grid shows the REQUIRED KEY BLUEPRINT you must match: a specific layout of 0s (white) and 9s (blue).\n* Key generation mechanism (explicit):\n  - The KEY GENERATOR is a field/patch consisting of 0s and 9s that is NOT surrounded by 5s (i.e., not the exit).\n  - When any part of your 8×8 player walks onto this patch, a NEW candidate key is generated and displayed in the bottom-left.\n  - Step OFF the patch and then back ON to generate yet another candidate key; repeat to cycle through possibilities.\n  - You must keep cycling until the bottom-left candidate key EXACTLY matches the exit’s key (the same distribution of 0s and 9s seen within/adjacent to the 5s).\n* A reliable way to locate both the EXIT and the KEY GENERATOR area:\n  - Look for clusters of 0s and 9s reachable via 3s; if they are NOT framed by 5s, that area is most likely the generator. If you see 5s nearby framing a matching 0/9 pattern, that marks the exit.\n* When the pattern shown in the bottom-left matches the arrangement of 0s and 9s you see framed by (or adjacent to) 5s at the exit, move toward the 5s to complete the level.\n\n# HUD / PROGRESSION\n* Visual score on the second-to-last grid row (row 62): it contains several 4-cell “slots”.\n  - Slots made of 3s represent UNFINISHED levels.\n  - When a slot changes from 3s to another color, that level is COMPLETE.\n* Track remaining MOVES/ENERGY by counting tiles with value 15.\n* Track LIVES by counting distinct 2×2 blocks of 8s.\n\n# GENERAL NOTES\n* The grid is a bird’s-eye view.\n* If the grid does not change after an action, you likely attempted an illegal move into 4s.\n* Favor routes marked by 3s; scan for 0/9 patches (generator) and confirm exit by nearby 5s; confirm the key by matching the bottom-left blueprint of 0s/9s.\n\n# EXAMPLE STRATEGY OBSERVATION\nThe 8×8 player (top rows 12s, bottom rows 9s) is flush against 4s on the left, so LEFT is blocked. I can see a 0/9 patch reachable via 3s to the right (likely the generator) and some 5s beyond it, so I should move RIGHT toward that corridor, cycling the key on the generator until the bottom-left key matches the one at the exit.\n\n# TURN:\nCall exactly one action.\n"

One Frame is made of one or more sequential\nGrids. Each Grid is a matrix size INT<0,63> by INT<0,63> filled with\nINT<0,15> values. Each value represents a different color and usually implies a different object.\n\nYou are playing a game called LockSmith.\n\n# CONTROLS\n* RESET: start over\n* ACTION1: move up\n* ACTION2: move down\n* ACTION3: move left\n* ACTION4: move right\n* ACTION5/ACTION6: no-ops\n\n# GOAL\nFind/generate a key that MATCHES the key pattern shown at the EXIT, then navigate to the EXIT to finish the level.\nThere are 6 levels total. Complete all levels to WIN.\n\n# TILE MEANINGS (important ones)\n* 0 = white cell (used in key patterns)\n* 3 = walkable path / corridor marker (often outlines routes to key/exit)\n* 4 = WALL (solid). You cannot enter 4s.\n* 5 = EXIT indicator (presence of 5s marks/frames the exit area)\n* 8 = LIFE token (count lives as the number of 2×2 blocks of 8s)\n* 9 = blue cells (used in player lower body; also appear elsewhere in the map and in key logic)\n* 12 = orange cells (used in player upper body)\n* 15 = MOVE counter (number of 15s ≈ moves/energy left)\n\n# PLAYER (sprite + movement legality)\n* The player is an 8×8 sprite made ONLY of 12s (top two rows) over 9s (bottom six rows).\n  - Concretely: rows 0–1 (relative to the sprite) are all 12s; rows 2–7 are all 9s.\n  - Other scattered 9s on the board are NOT the player—only the exact 8×8 (2×8 of 12s stacked on 6×8 of 9s) is the player.\n* Movement rules:\n  - You may move only through non-4 cells (i.e., never overlap a 4 after a move).\n  - If any part of your 8×8 sprite would overlap a 4 in the target direction (including cases where 4s lie “under” 9s), that move is ILLEGAL.\n  - If your sprite is already touching 4s on a side, you cannot move further in that touching direction until you have clearance.\n  - Practically: navigate corridors “between the 4s”.\n\n# KEYS, EXIT, AND HOW TO FIND THEM\n* The EXIT contains (or is adjacent to) the target key pattern and is marked by nearby 5s (it need not be fully surrounded; any 5s strongly indicate the exit region).\n* The bottom-left of the entire grid shows the REQUIRED KEY BLUEPRINT you must match: a specific layout of 0s (white) and 9s (blue).\n* Key generation mechanism (explicit):\n  - The KEY GENERATOR is a field/patch consisting of 0s and 9s that is NOT surrounded by 5s (i.e., not the exit).\n  - When any part of your 8×8 player walks onto this patch, a NEW candidate key is generated and displayed in the bottom-left.\n  - Step OFF the patch and then back ON to generate yet another candidate key; repeat to cycle through possibilities.\n  - You must keep cycling until the bottom-left candidate key EXACTLY matches the exit’s key (the same distribution of 0s and 9s seen within/adjacent to the 5s).\n* A reliable way to locate both the EXIT and the KEY GENERATOR area:\n  - Look for clusters of 0s and 9s reachable via 3s; if they are NOT framed by 5s, that area is most likely the generator. If you see 5s nearby framing a matching 0/9 pattern, that marks the exit.\n* When the pattern shown in the bottom-left matches the arrangement of 0s and 9s you see framed by (or adjacent to) 5s at the exit, move toward the 5s to complete the level.\n\n# HUD / PROGRESSION\n* Visual score on the second-to-last grid row (row 62): it contains several 4-cell “slots”.\n  - Slots made of 3s represent UNFINISHED levels.\n  - When a slot changes from 3s to another color, that level is COMPLETE.\n* Track remaining MOVES/ENERGY by counting tiles with value 15.\n* Track LIVES by counting distinct 2×2 blocks of 8s.\n\n# GENERAL NOTES\n* The grid is a bird’s-eye view.\n* If the grid does not change after an action, you likely attempted an illegal move into 4s.\n* Favor routes marked by 3s; scan for 0/9 patches (generator) and confirm exit by nearby 5s; confirm the key by matching the bottom-left blueprint of 0s/9s.\n\n# EXAMPLE STRATEGY OBSERVATION\nThe 8×8 player (top rows 12s, bottom rows 9s) is flush against 4s on the left, so LEFT is blocked. I can see a 0/9 patch reachable via 3s to the right (likely the generator) and some 5s beyond it, so I should move RIGHT toward that corridor, cycling the key on the generator until the bottom-left key matches the one at the exit.\n\n# TURN:\nCall exactly one action.\n"

    "content": "\n# CONTEXT:\nYou are an agent playing a dynamic game. Your objective is to\nWIN and avoid GAME_OVER while minimizing actions.\n\nOne action produces one Frame. One Frame is made of one or more sequential\nGrids. Each Grid is a matrix size INT<0,63> by INT<0,63> filled with\nINT<0,15> values. Each value represents a different color and usually implies a different object.\n\nYou are playing a game called LockSmith.\n\n# CONTROLS\n* RESET: start over\n* ACTION1: move up\n* ACTION2: move down\n* ACTION3: move left\n* ACTION4: move right\n* ACTION5/ACTION6: no-ops\n\n# GOAL\nFind/generate a key that MATCHES the key pattern shown at the EXIT, then navigate to the EXIT to finish the level.\nThere are 6 levels total. Complete all levels to WIN.\n\n# TILE MEANINGS (important ones)\n* 0 = white cell (used in key patterns)\n* 3 = walkable path / corridor marker (often outlines routes to key/exit)\n* 4 = WALL (solid). You cannot enter 4s.\n* 5 = EXIT indicator (presence of 5s marks/frames the exit area)\n* 8 = LIFE token (count lives as the number of 2×2 blocks of 8s)\n* 9 = blue cells (used in player lower body; also appear elsewhere in the map and in key logic)\n* 12 = orange cells (used in player upper body)\n* 15 = MOVE counter (number of 15s ≈ moves/energy left)\n\n# PLAYER (sprite + movement legality)\n* The player is an 8×8 sprite made ONLY of 12s (top two rows) over 9s (bottom six rows).\n  - Concretely: rows 0–1 (relative to the sprite) are all 12s; rows 2–7 are all 9s.\n  - Other scattered 9s on the board are NOT the player—only the exact 8×8 (2×8 of 12s stacked on 6×8 of 9s) is the player.\n* Movement rules:\n  - You may move only through non-4 cells (i.e., never overlap a 4 after a move).\n  - If any part of your 8×8 sprite would overlap a 4 in the target direction (including cases where 4s lie “under” 9s), that move is ILLEGAL.\n  - If your sprite is already touching 4s on a side, you cannot move further in that touching direction until you have clearance.\n  - Practically: navigate corridors “between the 4s”.\n\n# KEYS, EXIT, AND HOW TO FIND THEM\n* The EXIT contains (or is adjacent to) the target key pattern and is marked by nearby 5s (it need not be fully surrounded; any 5s strongly indicate the exit region).\n* The bottom-left of the entire grid shows the REQUIRED KEY BLUEPRINT you must match: a specific layout of 0s (white) and 9s (blue).\n* Key generation mechanism (explicit):\n  - The KEY GENERATOR is a field/patch consisting of 0s and 9s that is NOT surrounded by 5s (i.e., not the exit).\n  - When any part of your 8×8 player walks onto this patch, a NEW candidate key is generated and displayed in the bottom-left.\n  - Step OFF the patch and then back ON to generate yet another candidate key; repeat to cycle through possibilities.\n  - You must keep cycling until the bottom-left candidate key EXACTLY matches the exit’s key (the same distribution of 0s and 9s seen within/adjacent to the 5s).\n* A reliable way to locate both the EXIT and the KEY GENERATOR area:\n  - Look for clusters of 0s and 9s reachable via 3s; if they are NOT framed by 5s, that area is most likely the generator. If you see 5s nearby framing a matching 0/9 pattern, that marks the exit.\n* When the pattern shown in the bottom-left matches the arrangement of 0s and 9s you see framed by (or adjacent to) 5s at the exit, move toward the 5s to complete the level.\n\n# HUD / PROGRESSION\n* Visual score on the second-to-last grid row (row 62): it contains several 4-cell “slots”.\n  - Slots made of 3s represent UNFINISHED levels.\n  - When a slot changes from 3s to another color, that level is COMPLETE.\n* Track remaining MOVES/ENERGY by counting tiles with value 15.\n* Track LIVES by counting distinct 2×2 blocks of 8s.\n\n# GENERAL NOTES\n* The grid is a bird’s-eye view.\n* If the grid does not change after an action, you likely attempted an illegal move into 4s.\n* Favor routes marked by 3s; scan for 0/9 patches (generator) and confirm exit by nearby 5s; confirm the key by matching the bottom-left blueprint of 0s/9s.\n\n# EXAMPLE STRATEGY OBSERVATION\nThe 8×8 player (top rows 12s, bottom rows 9s) is flush against 4s on the left, so LEFT is blocked. I can see a 0/9 patch reachable via 3s to the right (likely the generator) and some 5s beyond it, so I should move RIGHT toward that corridor, cycling the key on the generator until the bottom-left key matches the one at the exit.\n\n# TURN:\nCall exactly one action.\n"

    "content": "\n# CONTEXT:\nYou are an agent playing a dynamic game. Your objective is to\nWIN and avoid GAME_OVER while minimizing actions.\n\nOne action produces one Frame. One Frame is made of one or more sequential\nGrids. Each Grid is a matrix size INT<0,63> by INT<0,63> filled with\nINT<0,15> values. Each value represents a different color and usually implies a different object.\n\nYou are playing a game called LockSmith.\n\n# CONTROLS\n* RESET: start over\n* ACTION1: move up\n* ACTION2: move down\n* ACTION3: move left\n* ACTION4: move right\n* ACTION5/ACTION6: no-ops\n\n# GOAL\nFind/generate a key that MATCHES the key pattern shown at the EXIT, then navigate to the EXIT to finish the level.\nThere are 6 levels total. Complete all levels to WIN.\n\n# TILE MEANINGS (important ones)\n* 0 = white cell (used in key patterns)\n* 3 = walkable path / corridor marker (often outlines routes to key/exit)\n* 4 = WALL (solid). You cannot enter 4s.\n* 5 = EXIT indicator (presence of 5s marks/frames the exit area)\n* 8 = LIFE token (count lives as the number of 2×2 blocks of 8s)\n* 9 = blue cells (used in player lower body; also appear elsewhere in the map and in key logic)\n* 12 = orange cells (used in player upper body)\n* 15 = MOVE counter (number of 15s ≈ moves/energy left)\n\n# PLAYER (sprite + movement legality)\n* The player is an 8×8 sprite made ONLY of 12s (top two rows) over 9s (bottom six rows).\n  - Concretely: rows 0–1 (relative to the sprite) are all 12s; rows 2–7 are all 9s.\n  - Other scattered 9s on the board are NOT the player—only the exact 8×8 (2×8 of 12s stacked on 6×8 of 9s) is the player.\n* Movement rules:\n  - You may move only through non-4 cells (i.e., never overlap a 4 after a move).\n  - If any part of your 8×8 sprite would overlap a 4 in the target direction (including cases where 4s lie “under” 9s), that move is ILLEGAL.\n  - If your sprite is already touching 4s on a side, you cannot move further in that touching direction until you have clearance.\n  - Practically: navigate corridors “between the 4s”.\n\n# KEYS, EXIT, AND HOW TO FIND THEM\n* The EXIT contains (or is adjacent to) the target key pattern and is marked by nearby 5s (it need not be fully surrounded; any 5s strongly indicate the exit region).\n* The bottom-left of the entire grid shows the REQUIRED KEY BLUEPRINT you must match: a specific layout of 0s (white) and 9s (blue).\n* Key generation mechanism (explicit):\n  - The KEY GENERATOR is a field/patch consisting of 0s and 9s that is NOT surrounded by 5s (i.e., not the exit).\n  - When any part of your 8×8 player walks onto this patch, a NEW candidate key is generated and displayed in the bottom-left.\n  - Step OFF the patch and then back ON to generate yet another candidate key; repeat to cycle through possibilities.\n  - You must keep cycling until the bottom-left candidate key EXACTLY matches the exit’s key (the same distribution of 0s and 9s seen within/adjacent to the 5s).\n* A reliable way to locate both the EXIT and the KEY GENERATOR area:\n  - Look for clusters of 0s and 9s reachable via 3s; if they are NOT framed by 5s, that area is most likely the generator. If you see 5s nearby framing a matching 0/9 pattern, that marks the exit.\n* When the pattern shown in the bottom-left matches the arrangement of 0s and 9s you see framed by (or adjacent to) 5s at the exit, move toward the 5s to complete the level.\n\n# HUD / PROGRESSION\n* Visual score on the second-to-last grid row (row 62): it contains several 4-cell “slots”.\n  - Slots made of 3s represent UNFINISHED levels.\n  - When a slot changes from 3s to another color, that level is COMPLETE.\n* Track remaining MOVES/ENERGY by counting tiles with value 15.\n* Track LIVES by counting distinct 2×2 blocks of 8s.\n\n# GENERAL NOTES\n* The grid is a bird’s-eye view.\n* If the grid does not change after an action, you likely attempted an illegal move into 4s.\n* Favor routes marked by 3s; scan for 0/9 patches (generator) and confirm exit by nearby 5s; confirm the key by matching the bottom-left blueprint of 0s/9s.\n\n# EXAMPLE STRATEGY OBSERVATION\nThe 8×8 player (top rows 12s, bottom rows 9s) is flush against 4s on the left, so LEFT is blocked. I can see a 0/9 patch reachable via 3s to the right (likely the generator) and some 5s beyond it, so I should move RIGHT toward that corridor, cycling the key on the generator until the bottom-left key matches the one at the exit.\n\n# TURN:\nCall exactly one action.\n"

The EXIT is the 5‑framed area up and a bit left (you can see the 5s with the 0/9 pattern inside). A separate 0/9 patch that is not surrounded by 5s (the key generator) is down‑left along the 3s path and matches the bottom‑left blueprint area. Plan: walk left/down along the 3s corridor toward that generator, then step off/on it to cycle keys until the bottom‑left blueprint matches the exit pattern, then return to the 5s to finish the level."

    "content": "\n# CONTEXT:\nYou are an agent playing a dynamic game. Your objective is to\nWIN and avoid GAME_OVER while minimizing actions.\n\nOne action produces one Frame. One Frame is made of one or more sequential\nGrids. Each Grid is a matrix size INT<0,63> by INT<0,63> filled with\nINT<0,15> values. Each value represents a different color and usually implies a different object.\n\nYou are playing a game called LockSmith.\n\n# CONTROLS\n* RESET: start over\n* ACTION1: move up\n* ACTION2: move down\n* ACTION3: move left\n* ACTION4: move right\n* ACTION5/ACTION6: no-ops\n\n# GOAL\nFind/generate a key that MATCHES the key pattern shown at the EXIT, then navigate to the EXIT to finish the level.\nThere are 6 levels total. Complete all levels to WIN.\n\n# TILE MEANINGS (important ones)\n* 0 = white cell (used in key patterns)\n* 3 = walkable path / corridor marker (often outlines routes to key/exit)\n* 4 = WALL (solid). You cannot enter 4s.\n* 5 = EXIT indicator (presence of 5s marks/frames the exit area)\n* 8 = LIFE token (count lives as the number of 2×2 blocks of 8s)\n* 9 = blue cells (used in player lower body; also appear elsewhere in the map and in key logic)\n* 12 = orange cells (used in player upper body)\n* 15 = MOVE counter (number of 15s ≈ moves/energy left)\n\n# PLAYER (sprite + movement legality)\n* The player is an 8×8 sprite made ONLY of 12s (top two rows) over 9s (bottom six rows).\n  - Concretely: rows 0–1 (relative to the sprite) are all 12s; rows 2–7 are all 9s.\n  - Other scattered 9s on the board are NOT the player—only the exact 8×8 (2×8 of 12s stacked on 6×8 of 9s) is the player.\n* Movement rules:\n  - You may move only through non-4 cells (i.e., never overlap a 4 after a move).\n  - If any part of your 8×8 sprite would overlap a 4 in the target direction (including cases where 4s lie “under” 9s), that move is ILLEGAL.\n  - If your sprite is already touching 4s on a side, you cannot move further in that touching direction until you have clearance.\n  - Practically: navigate corridors “between the 4s”.\n\n# KEYS, EXIT, AND HOW TO FIND THEM\n* The EXIT contains (or is adjacent to) the target key pattern and is marked by nearby 5s (it need not be fully surrounded; any 5s strongly indicate the exit region).\n* The bottom-left of the entire grid shows the REQUIRED KEY BLUEPRINT you must match: a specific layout of 0s (white) and 9s (blue).\n* Key generation mechanism (explicit):\n  - The KEY GENERATOR is a field/patch consisting of 0s and 9s that is NOT surrounded by 5s (i.e., not the exit).\n  - When any part of your 8×8 player walks onto this patch, a NEW candidate key is generated and displayed in the bottom-left.\n  - Step OFF the patch and then back ON to generate yet another candidate key; repeat to cycle through possibilities.\n  - You must keep cycling until the bottom-left candidate key EXACTLY matches the exit’s key (the same distribution of 0s and 9s seen within/adjacent to the 5s).\n* A reliable way to locate both the EXIT and the KEY GENERATOR area:\n  - Look for clusters of 0s and 9s reachable via 3s; if they are NOT framed by 5s, that area is most likely the generator. If you see 5s nearby framing a matching 0/9 pattern, that marks the exit.\n* When the pattern shown in the bottom-left matches the arrangement of 0s and 9s you see framed by (or adjacent to) 5s at the exit, move toward the 5s to complete the level.\n\n# HUD / PROGRESSION\n* Visual score on the second-to-last grid row (row 62): it contains several 4-cell “slots”.\n  - Slots made of 3s represent UNFINISHED levels.\n  - When a slot changes from 3s to another color, that level is COMPLETE.\n* Track remaining MOVES/ENERGY by counting tiles with value 15.\n* Track LIVES by counting distinct 2×2 blocks of 8s.\n\n# GENERAL NOTES\n* The grid is a bird’s-eye view.\n* If the grid does not change after an action, you likely attempted an illegal move into 4s.\n* Favor routes marked by 3s; scan for 0/9 patches (generator) and confirm exit by nearby 5s; confirm the key by matching the bottom-left blueprint of 0s/9s.\n\n# EXAMPLE STRATEGY OBSERVATION\nThe 8×8 player (top rows 12s, bottom rows 9s) is flush against 4s on the left, so LEFT is blocked. I can see a 0/9 patch reachable via 3s to the right (likely the generator) and some 5s beyond it, so I should move RIGHT toward that corridor, cycling the key on the generator until the bottom-left key matches the one at the exit.\n\n# TURN:\nCall exactly one action.\n"

    "content": "\n# CONTEXT:\nYou are an agent playing a dynamic game. Your objective is to\nWIN and avoid GAME_OVER while minimizing actions.\n\nOne action produces one Frame. One Frame is made of one or more sequential\nGrids. Each Grid is a matrix size INT<0,63> by INT<0,63> filled with\nINT<0,15> values. Each value represents a different color and usually implies a different object.\n\nYou are playing a game called LockSmith.\n\n# CONTROLS\n* RESET: start over\n* ACTION1: move up\n* ACTION2: move down\n* ACTION3: move left\n* ACTION4: move right\n* ACTION5/ACTION6: no-ops\n\n# GOAL\nFind/generate a key that MATCHES the key pattern shown at the EXIT, then navigate to the EXIT to finish the level.\nThere are 6 levels total. Complete all levels to WIN.\n\n# TILE MEANINGS (important ones)\n* 0 = white cell (used in key patterns)\n* 3 = walkable path / corridor marker (often outlines routes to key/exit)\n* 4 = WALL (solid). You cannot enter 4s.\n* 5 = EXIT indicator (presence of 5s marks/frames the exit area)\n* 8 = LIFE token (count lives as the number of 2×2 blocks of 8s)\n* 9 = blue cells (used in player lower body; also appear elsewhere in the map and in key logic)\n* 12 = orange cells (used in player upper body)\n* 15 = MOVE counter (number of 15s ≈ moves/energy left)\n\n# PLAYER (sprite + movement legality)\n* The player is an 8×8 sprite made ONLY of 12s (top two rows) over 9s (bottom six rows).\n  - Concretely: rows 0–1 (relative to the sprite) are all 12s; rows 2–7 are all 9s.\n  - Other scattered 9s on the board are NOT the player—only the exact 8×8 (2×8 of 12s stacked on 6×8 of 9s) is the player.\n* Movement rules:\n  - You may move only through non-4 cells (i.e., never overlap a 4 after a move).\n  - If any part of your 8×8 sprite would overlap a 4 in the target direction (including cases where 4s lie “under” 9s), that move is ILLEGAL.\n  - If your sprite is already touching 4s on a side, you cannot move further in that touching direction until you have clearance.\n  - Practically: navigate corridors “between the 4s”.\n\n# KEYS, EXIT, AND HOW TO FIND THEM\n* The EXIT contains (or is adjacent to) the target key pattern and is marked by nearby 5s (it need not be fully surrounded; any 5s strongly indicate the exit region).\n* The bottom-left of the entire grid shows the REQUIRED KEY BLUEPRINT you must match: a specific layout of 0s (white) and 9s (blue).\n* Key generation mechanism (explicit):\n  - The KEY GENERATOR is a field/patch consisting of 0s and 9s that is NOT surrounded by 5s (i.e., not the exit).\n  - When any part of your 8×8 player walks onto this patch, a NEW candidate key is generated and displayed in the bottom-left.\n  - Step OFF the patch and then back ON to generate yet another candidate key; repeat to cycle through possibilities.\n  - You must keep cycling until the bottom-left candidate key EXACTLY matches the exit’s key (the same distribution of 0s and 9s seen within/adjacent to the 5s).\n* A reliable way to locate both the EXIT and the KEY GENERATOR area:\n  - Look for clusters of 0s and 9s reachable via 3s; if they are NOT framed by 5s, that area is most likely the generator. If you see 5s nearby framing a matching 0/9 pattern, that marks the exit.\n* When the pattern shown in the bottom-left matches the arrangement of 0s and 9s you see framed by (or adjacent to) 5s at the exit, move toward the 5s to complete the level.\n\n# HUD / PROGRESSION\n* Visual score on the second-to-last grid row (row 62): it contains several 4-cell “slots”.\n  - Slots made of 3s represent UNFINISHED levels.\n  - When a slot changes from 3s to another color, that level is COMPLETE.\n* Track remaining MOVES/ENERGY by counting tiles with value 15.\n* Track LIVES by counting distinct 2×2 blocks of 8s.\n\n# GENERAL NOTES\n* The grid is a bird’s-eye view.\n* If the grid does not change after an action, you likely attempted an illegal move into 4s.\n* Favor routes marked by 3s; scan for 0/9 patches (generator) and confirm exit by nearby 5s; confirm the key by matching the bottom-left blueprint of 0s/9s.\n\n# EXAMPLE STRATEGY OBSERVATION\nThe 8×8 player (top rows 12s, bottom rows 9s) is flush against 4s on the left, so LEFT is blocked. I can see a 0/9 patch reachable via 3s to the right (likely the generator) and some 5s beyond it, so I should move RIGHT toward that corridor, cycling the key on the generator until the bottom-left key matches the one at the exit.\n\n# TURN:\nCall exactly one action.\n"

    "content": "\n# CONTEXT:\nYou are an agent playing a dynamic game. Your objective is to\nWIN and avoid GAME_OVER while minimizing actions.\n\nOne action produces one Frame. One Frame is made of one or more sequential\nGrids. Each Grid is a matrix size INT<0,63> by INT<0,63> filled with\nINT<0,15> values. Each value represents a different color and usually implies a different object.\n\nYou are playing a game called LockSmith.\n\n# CONTROLS\n* RESET: start over\n* ACTION1: move up\n* ACTION2: move down\n* ACTION3: move left\n* ACTION4: move right\n* ACTION5/ACTION6: no-ops\n\n# GOAL\nFind/generate a key that MATCHES the key pattern shown at the EXIT, then navigate to the EXIT to finish the level.\nThere are 6 levels total. Complete all levels to WIN.\n\n# TILE MEANINGS (important ones)\n* 0 = white cell (used in key patterns)\n* 3 = walkable path / corridor marker (often outlines routes to key/exit)\n* 4 = WALL (solid). You cannot enter 4s.\n* 5 = EXIT indicator (presence of 5s marks/frames the exit area)\n* 8 = LIFE token (count lives as the number of 2×2 blocks of 8s)\n* 9 = blue cells (used in player lower body; also appear elsewhere in the map and in key logic)\n* 12 = orange cells (used in player upper body)\n* 15 = MOVE counter (number of 15s ≈ moves/energy left)\n\n# PLAYER (sprite + movement legality)\n* The player is an 8×8 sprite made ONLY of 12s (top two rows) over 9s (bottom six rows).\n  - Concretely: rows 0–1 (relative to the sprite) are all 12s; rows 2–7 are all 9s.\n  - Other scattered 9s on the board are NOT the player—only the exact 8×8 (2×8 of 12s stacked on 6×8 of 9s) is the player.\n* Movement rules:\n  - You may move only through non-4 cells (i.e., never overlap a 4 after a move).\n  - If any part of your 8×8 sprite would overlap a 4 in the target direction (including cases where 4s lie “under” 9s), that move is ILLEGAL.\n  - If your sprite is already touching 4s on a side, you cannot move further in that touching direction until you have clearance.\n  - Practically: navigate corridors “between the 4s”.\n\n# KEYS, EXIT, AND HOW TO FIND THEM\n* The EXIT contains (or is adjacent to) the target key pattern and is marked by nearby 5s (it need not be fully surrounded; any 5s strongly indicate the exit region).\n* The bottom-left of the entire grid shows the REQUIRED KEY BLUEPRINT you must match: a specific layout of 0s (white) and 9s (blue).\n* Key generation mechanism (explicit):\n  - The KEY GENERATOR is a field/patch consisting of 0s and 9s that is NOT surrounded by 5s (i.e., not the exit).\n  - When any part of your 8×8 player walks onto this patch, a NEW candidate key is generated and displayed in the bottom-left.\n  - Step OFF the patch and then back ON to generate yet another candidate key; repeat to cycle through possibilities.\n  - You must keep cycling until the bottom-left candidate key EXACTLY matches the exit’s key (the same distribution of 0s and 9s seen within/adjacent to the 5s).\n* A reliable way to locate both the EXIT and the KEY GENERATOR area:\n  - Look for clusters of 0s and 9s reachable via 3s; if they are NOT framed by 5s, that area is most likely the generator. If you see 5s nearby framing a matching 0/9 pattern, that marks the exit.\n* When the pattern shown in the bottom-left matches the arrangement of 0s and 9s you see framed by (or adjacent to) 5s at the exit, move toward the 5s to complete the level.\n\n# HUD / PROGRESSION\n* Visual score on the second-to-last grid row (row 62): it contains several 4-cell “slots”.\n  - Slots made of 3s represent UNFINISHED levels.\n  - When a slot changes from 3s to another color, that level is COMPLETE.\n* Track remaining MOVES/ENERGY by counting tiles with value 15.\n* Track LIVES by counting distinct 2×2 blocks of 8s.\n\n# GENERAL NOTES\n* The grid is a bird’s-eye view.\n* If the grid does not change after an action, you likely attempted an illegal move into 4s.\n* Favor routes marked by 3s; scan for 0/9 patches (generator) and confirm exit by nearby 5s; confirm the key by matching the bottom-left blueprint of 0s/9s.\n\n# EXAMPLE STRATEGY OBSERVATION\nThe 8×8 player (top rows 12s, bottom rows 9s) is flush against 4s on the left, so LEFT is blocked. I can see a 0/9 patch reachable via 3s to the right (likely the generator) and some 5s beyond it, so I should move RIGHT toward that corridor, cycling the key on the generator until the bottom-left key matches the one at the exit.\n\n# TURN:\nCall exactly one action.\n"

The EXIT is the 5‑framed region up and slightly left (you can see 5s surrounding the target 0/9 pattern). A separate 0/9 patch (the key generator) is down‑left along the 3‑marked corridor. Path of 3s connects my current position to that generator, so I should head left then down along the 3s to step onto the generator and start cycling keys."

    "content": "\n# CONTEXT:\nYou are an agent playing a dynamic game. Your objective is to\nWIN and avoid GAME_OVER while minimizing actions.\n\nOne action produces one Frame. One Frame is made of one or more sequential\nGrids. Each Grid is a matrix size INT<0,63> by INT<0,63> filled with\nINT<0,15> values. Each value represents a different color and usually implies a different object.\n\nYou are playing a game called LockSmith.\n\n# CONTROLS\n* RESET: start over\n* ACTION1: move up\n* ACTION2: move down\n* ACTION3: move left\n* ACTION4: move right\n* ACTION5/ACTION6: no-ops\n\n# GOAL\nFind/generate a key that MATCHES the key pattern shown at the EXIT, then navigate to the EXIT to finish the level.\nThere are 6 levels total. Complete all levels to WIN.\n\n# TILE MEANINGS (important ones)\n* 0 = white cell (used in key patterns)\n* 3 = walkable path / corridor marker (often outlines routes to key/exit)\n* 4 = WALL (solid). You cannot enter 4s.\n* 5 = EXIT indicator (presence of 5s marks/frames the exit area)\n* 8 = LIFE token (count lives as the number of 2×2 blocks of 8s)\n* 9 = blue cells (used in player lower body; also appear elsewhere in the map and in key logic)\n* 12 = orange cells (used in player upper body)\n* 15 = MOVE counter (number of 15s ≈ moves/energy left)\n\n# PLAYER (sprite + movement legality)\n* The player is an 8×8 sprite made ONLY of 12s (top two rows) over 9s (bottom six rows).\n  - Concretely: rows 0–1 (relative to the sprite) are all 12s; rows 2–7 are all 9s.\n  - Other scattered 9s on the board are NOT the player—only the exact 8×8 (2×8 of 12s stacked on 6×8 of 9s) is the player.\n* Movement rules:\n  - You may move only through non-4 cells (i.e., never overlap a 4 after a move).\n  - If any part of your 8×8 sprite would overlap a 4 in the target direction (including cases where 4s lie “under” 9s), that move is ILLEGAL.\n  - If your sprite is already touching 4s on a side, you cannot move further in that touching direction until you have clearance.\n  - Practically: navigate corridors “between the 4s”.\n\n# KEYS, EXIT, AND HOW TO FIND THEM\n* The EXIT contains (or is adjacent to) the target key pattern and is marked by nearby 5s (it need not be fully surrounded; any 5s strongly indicate the exit region).\n* The bottom-left of the entire grid shows the REQUIRED KEY BLUEPRINT you must match: a specific layout of 0s (white) and 9s (blue).\n* Key generation mechanism (explicit):\n  - The KEY GENERATOR is a field/patch consisting of 0s and 9s that is NOT surrounded by 5s (i.e., not the exit).\n  - When any part of your 8×8 player walks onto this patch, a NEW candidate key is generated and displayed in the bottom-left.\n  - Step OFF the patch and then back ON to generate yet another candidate key; repeat to cycle through possibilities.\n  - You must keep cycling until the bottom-left candidate key EXACTLY matches the exit’s key (the same distribution of 0s and 9s seen within/adjacent to the 5s).\n* A reliable way to locate both the EXIT and the KEY GENERATOR area:\n  - Look for clusters of 0s and 9s reachable via 3s; if they are NOT framed by 5s, that area is most likely the generator. If you see 5s nearby framing a matching 0/9 pattern, that marks the exit.\n* When the pattern shown in the bottom-left matches the arrangement of 0s and 9s you see framed by (or adjacent to) 5s at the exit, move toward the 5s to complete the level.\n\n# HUD / PROGRESSION\n* Visual score on the second-to-last grid row (row 62): it contains several 4-cell “slots”.\n  - Slots made of 3s represent UNFINISHED levels.\n  - When a slot changes from 3s to another color, that level is COMPLETE.\n* Track remaining MOVES/ENERGY by counting tiles with value 15.\n* Track LIVES by counting distinct 2×2 blocks of 8s.\n\n# GENERAL NOTES\n* The grid is a bird’s-eye view.\n* If the grid does not change after an action, you likely attempted an illegal move into 4s.\n* Favor routes marked by 3s; scan for 0/9 patches (generator) and confirm exit by nearby 5s; confirm the key by matching the bottom-left blueprint of 0s/9s.\n\n# EXAMPLE STRATEGY OBSERVATION\nThe 8×8 player (top rows 12s, bottom rows 9s) is flush against 4s on the left, so LEFT is blocked. I can see a 0/9 patch reachable via 3s to the right (likely the generator) and some 5s beyond it, so I should move RIGHT toward that corridor, cycling the key on the generator until the bottom-left key matches the one at the exit.\n\n# TURN:\nCall exactly one action.\n"

You cannot enter 4s.\n* 5 = EXIT indicator (presence of 5s marks/frames the exit area)\n* 8 = LIFE token (count lives as the number of 2×2 blocks of 8s)\n* 9 = blue cells (used in player lower body; also appear elsewhere in the map and in key logic)\n* 12 = orange cells (used in player upper body)\n* 15 = MOVE counter (number of 15s ≈ moves/energy left)\n\n# PLAYER (sprite + movement legality)\n* The player is an 8×8 sprite made ONLY of 12s (top two rows) over 9s (bottom six rows).\n  - Concretely: rows 0–1 (relative to the sprite) are all 12s; rows 2–7 are all 9s.\n  - Other scattered 9s on the board are NOT the player—only the exact 8×8 (2×8 of 12s stacked on 6×8 of 9s) is the player.\n* Movement rules:\n  - You may move only through non-4 cells (i.e., never overlap a 4 after a move).\n  - If any part of your 8×8 sprite would overlap a 4 in the target direction (including cases where 4s lie “under” 9s), that move is ILLEGAL.\n  - If your sprite is already touching 4s on a side, you cannot move further in that touching direction until you have clearance.\n  - Practically: navigate corridors “between the 4s”.\n\n# KEYS, EXIT, AND HOW TO FIND THEM\n* The EXIT contains (or is adjacent to) the target key pattern and is marked by nearby 5s (it need not be fully surrounded; any 5s strongly indicate the exit region).\n* The bottom-left of the entire grid shows the REQUIRED KEY BLUEPRINT you must match: a specific layout of 0s (white) and 9s (blue).\n* Key generation mechanism (explicit):\n  - The KEY GENERATOR is a field/patch consisting of 0s and 9s that is NOT surrounded by 5s (i.e., not the exit).\n  - When any part of your 8×8 player walks onto this patch, a NEW candidate key is generated and displayed in the bottom-left.\n  - Step OFF the patch and then back ON to generate yet another candidate key; repeat to cycle through possibilities.\n  - You must keep cycling until the bottom-left candidate key EXACTLY matches the exit’s key (the same distribution of 0s and 9s seen within/adjacent to the 5s).\n* A reliable way to locate both the EXIT and the KEY GENERATOR area:\n  - Look for clusters of 0s and 9s reachable via 3s; if they are NOT framed by 5s, that area is most likely the generator. If you see 5s nearby framing a matching 0/9 pattern, that marks the exit.\n* When the pattern shown in the bottom-left matches the arrangement of 0s and 9s you see framed by (or adjacent to) 5s at the exit, move toward the 5s to complete the level.\n\n# HUD / PROGRESSION\n* Visual score on the second-to-last grid row (row 62): it contains several 4-cell “slots”.\n  - Slots made of 3s represent UNFINISHED levels.\n  - When a slot changes from 3s to another color, that level is COMPLETE.\n* Track remaining MOVES/ENERGY by counting tiles with value 15.\n* Track LIVES by counting distinct 2×2 blocks of 8s.\n\n# GENERAL NOTES\n* The grid is a bird’s-eye view.\n* If the grid does not change after an action, you likely attempted an illegal move into 4s.\n* Favor routes marked by 3s; scan for 0/9 patches (generator) and confirm exit by nearby 5s; confirm the key by matching the bottom-left blueprint of 0s/9s.\n\n# EXAMPLE STRATEGY OBSERVATION\nThe 8×8 player (top rows 12s, bottom rows 9s) is flush against 4s on the left, so LEFT is blocked. I can see a 0/9 patch reachable via 3s to the right (likely the generator) and some 5s beyond it, so I should move RIGHT toward that corridor, cycling the key on the generator until the bottom-left key matches the one at the exit.\n\n# TURN:\nCall exactly one action.\n"
