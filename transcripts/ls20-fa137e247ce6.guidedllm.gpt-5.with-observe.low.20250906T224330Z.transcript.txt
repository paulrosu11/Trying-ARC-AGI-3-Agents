One Frame is made of one or more sequential\nGrids. Each Grid is a matrix size INT<0,63> by INT<0,63> filled with\nINT<0,15> values.\n\nYou are playing a game called LockSmith. Rules and strategy:\n* RESET: start over, ACTION1: move up, ACTION2: move down, ACTION3: move left, ACTION4: move right (ACTION5 and ACTION6 do nothing in this game)\n* you may may one action per turn\n* your goal is find and collect a matching key then touch the exit door\n* 6 levels total, score shows which level, complete all levels to win (grid row 62)\n* start each level with limited energy. you GAME_OVER if you run out (grid row 61)\n* the player is a 4x4 square: [[X,X,X,X],[0,0,0,X],[4,4,4,X],[4,4,4,X]] where X is transparent to the background\n* the grid represents a birds-eye view of the level\n* walls are made of INT<10>, you cannot move through a wall\n* walkable floor area is INT<8>\n* you can refill energy by touching energy pills (a 2x2 of INT<6>)\n* current key is shown in bottom-left of entire grid\n* the exit door is a 4x4 square with INT<11> border\n* to find a new key shape, touch the key rotator, a 4x4 square denoted by INT<9> and INT<4> in the top-left corner of the square\n* to find a new key color, touch the color rotator, a 4x4 square denoted by INT<9> and INT<2> and in the bottom-left corner of the square\n* to rotate more than once, move 1 space away from the rotator and back on\n* continue rotating the shape and color of the key until the key matches the one inside the exit door (scaled down 2X)\n* if the grid does not change after an action, you probably tried to move into a wall\n\nAn example of a good strategy observation:\nThe player 4x4 made of INT<4> and INT<0> is standing below a wall of INT<10>, so I cannot move up anymore and should\nmove left towards the rotator with INT<11>.\n\n# TURN:\nCall exactly one action.\n"

One Frame is made of one or more sequential\nGrids. Each Grid is a matrix size INT<0,63> by INT<0,63> filled with\nINT<0,15> values.\n\nYou are playing a game called LockSmith. Rules and strategy:\n* RESET: start over, ACTION1: move up, ACTION2: move down, ACTION3: move left, ACTION4: move right (ACTION5 and ACTION6 do nothing in this game)\n* you may may one action per turn\n* your goal is find and collect a matching key then touch the exit door\n* 6 levels total, score shows which level, complete all levels to win (grid row 62)\n* start each level with limited energy. you GAME_OVER if you run out (grid row 61)\n* the player is a 4x4 square: [[X,X,X,X],[0,0,0,X],[4,4,4,X],[4,4,4,X]] where X is transparent to the background\n* the grid represents a birds-eye view of the level\n* walls are made of INT<10>, you cannot move through a wall\n* walkable floor area is INT<8>\n* you can refill energy by touching energy pills (a 2x2 of INT<6>)\n* current key is shown in bottom-left of entire grid\n* the exit door is a 4x4 square with INT<11> border\n* to find a new key shape, touch the key rotator, a 4x4 square denoted by INT<9> and INT<4> in the top-left corner of the square\n* to find a new key color, touch the color rotator, a 4x4 square denoted by INT<9> and INT<2> and in the bottom-left corner of the square\n* to rotate more than once, move 1 space away from the rotator and back on\n* continue rotating the shape and color of the key until the key matches the one inside the exit door (scaled down 2X)\n* if the grid does not change after an action, you probably tried to move into a wall\n\nAn example of a good strategy observation:\nThe player 4x4 made of INT<4> and INT<0> is standing below a wall of INT<10>, so I cannot move up anymore and should\nmove left towards the rotator with INT<11>.\n\n# TURN:\nCall exactly one action.\n"

One Frame is made of one or more sequential\nGrids. Each Grid is a matrix size INT<0,63> by INT<0,63> filled with\nINT<0,15> values.\n\nYou are playing a game called LockSmith. Rules and strategy:\n* RESET: start over, ACTION1: move up, ACTION2: move down, ACTION3: move left, ACTION4: move right (ACTION5 and ACTION6 do nothing in this game)\n* you may may one action per turn\n* your goal is find and collect a matching key then touch the exit door\n* 6 levels total, score shows which level, complete all levels to win (grid row 62)\n* start each level with limited energy. you GAME_OVER if you run out (grid row 61)\n* the player is a 4x4 square: [[X,X,X,X],[0,0,0,X],[4,4,4,X],[4,4,4,X]] where X is transparent to the background\n* the grid represents a birds-eye view of the level\n* walls are made of INT<10>, you cannot move through a wall\n* walkable floor area is INT<8>\n* you can refill energy by touching energy pills (a 2x2 of INT<6>)\n* current key is shown in bottom-left of entire grid\n* the exit door is a 4x4 square with INT<11> border\n* to find a new key shape, touch the key rotator, a 4x4 square denoted by INT<9> and INT<4> in the top-left corner of the square\n* to find a new key color, touch the color rotator, a 4x4 square denoted by INT<9> and INT<2> and in the bottom-left corner of the square\n* to rotate more than once, move 1 space away from the rotator and back on\n* continue rotating the shape and color of the key until the key matches the one inside the exit door (scaled down 2X)\n* if the grid does not change after an action, you probably tried to move into a wall\n\nAn example of a good strategy observation:\nThe player 4x4 made of INT<4> and INT<0> is standing below a wall of INT<10>, so I cannot move up anymore and should\nmove left towards the rotator with INT<11>.\n\n# TURN:\nCall exactly one action.\n"

One Frame is made of one or more sequential\nGrids. Each Grid is a matrix size INT<0,63> by INT<0,63> filled with\nINT<0,15> values.\n\nYou are playing a game called LockSmith. Rules and strategy:\n* RESET: start over, ACTION1: move up, ACTION2: move down, ACTION3: move left, ACTION4: move right (ACTION5 and ACTION6 do nothing in this game)\n* you may may one action per turn\n* your goal is find and collect a matching key then touch the exit door\n* 6 levels total, score shows which level, complete all levels to win (grid row 62)\n* start each level with limited energy. you GAME_OVER if you run out (grid row 61)\n* the player is a 4x4 square: [[X,X,X,X],[0,0,0,X],[4,4,4,X],[4,4,4,X]] where X is transparent to the background\n* the grid represents a birds-eye view of the level\n* walls are made of INT<10>, you cannot move through a wall\n* walkable floor area is INT<8>\n* you can refill energy by touching energy pills (a 2x2 of INT<6>)\n* current key is shown in bottom-left of entire grid\n* the exit door is a 4x4 square with INT<11> border\n* to find a new key shape, touch the key rotator, a 4x4 square denoted by INT<9> and INT<4> in the top-left corner of the square\n* to find a new key color, touch the color rotator, a 4x4 square denoted by INT<9> and INT<2> and in the bottom-left corner of the square\n* to rotate more than once, move 1 space away from the rotator and back on\n* continue rotating the shape and color of the key until the key matches the one inside the exit door (scaled down 2X)\n* if the grid does not change after an action, you probably tried to move into a wall\n\nAn example of a good strategy observation:\nThe player 4x4 made of INT<4> and INT<0> is standing below a wall of INT<10>, so I cannot move up anymore and should\nmove left towards the rotator with INT<11>.\n\n# TURN:\nCall exactly one action.\n"

One Frame is made of one or more sequential\nGrids. Each Grid is a matrix size INT<0,63> by INT<0,63> filled with\nINT<0,15> values.\n\nYou are playing a game called LockSmith. Rules and strategy:\n* RESET: start over, ACTION1: move up, ACTION2: move down, ACTION3: move left, ACTION4: move right (ACTION5 and ACTION6 do nothing in this game)\n* you may may one action per turn\n* your goal is find and collect a matching key then touch the exit door\n* 6 levels total, score shows which level, complete all levels to win (grid row 62)\n* start each level with limited energy. you GAME_OVER if you run out (grid row 61)\n* the player is a 4x4 square: [[X,X,X,X],[0,0,0,X],[4,4,4,X],[4,4,4,X]] where X is transparent to the background\n* the grid represents a birds-eye view of the level\n* walls are made of INT<10>, you cannot move through a wall\n* walkable floor area is INT<8>\n* you can refill energy by touching energy pills (a 2x2 of INT<6>)\n* current key is shown in bottom-left of entire grid\n* the exit door is a 4x4 square with INT<11> border\n* to find a new key shape, touch the key rotator, a 4x4 square denoted by INT<9> and INT<4> in the top-left corner of the square\n* to find a new key color, touch the color rotator, a 4x4 square denoted by INT<9> and INT<2> and in the bottom-left corner of the square\n* to rotate more than once, move 1 space away from the rotator and back on\n* continue rotating the shape and color of the key until the key matches the one inside the exit door (scaled down 2X)\n* if the grid does not change after an action, you probably tried to move into a wall\n\nAn example of a good strategy observation:\nThe player 4x4 made of INT<4> and INT<0> is standing below a wall of INT<10>, so I cannot move up anymore and should\nmove left towards the rotator with INT<11>.\n\n# TURN:\nCall exactly one action.\n"

Rules and strategy:\n* RESET: start over, ACTION1: move up, ACTION2: move down, ACTION3: move left, ACTION4: move right (ACTION5 and ACTION6 do nothing in this game)\n* you may may one action per turn\n* your goal is find and collect a matching key then touch the exit door\n* 6 levels total, score shows which level, complete all levels to win (grid row 62)\n* start each level with limited energy. you GAME_OVER if you run out (grid row 61)\n* the player is a 4x4 square: [[X,X,X,X],[0,0,0,X],[4,4,4,X],[4,4,4,X]] where X is transparent to the background\n* the grid represents a birds-eye view of the level\n* walls are made of INT<10>, you cannot move through a wall\n* walkable floor area is INT<8>\n* you can refill energy by touching energy pills (a 2x2 of INT<6>)\n* current key is shown in bottom-left of entire grid\n* the exit door is a 4x4 square with INT<11> border\n* to find a new key shape, touch the key rotator, a 4x4 square denoted by INT<9> and INT<4> in the top-left corner of the square\n* to find a new key color, touch the color rotator, a 4x4 square denoted by INT<9> and INT<2> and in the bottom-left corner of the square\n* to rotate more than once, move 1 space away from the rotator and back on\n* continue rotating the shape and color of the key until the key matches the one inside the exit door (scaled down 2X)\n* if the grid does not change after an action, you probably tried to move into a wall\n\nAn example of a good strategy observation:\nThe player 4x4 made of INT<4> and INT<0> is standing below a wall of INT<10>, so I cannot move up anymore and should\nmove left towards the rotator with INT<11>.\n\n# TURN:\nCall exactly one action.\n"

One Frame is made of one or more sequential\nGrids. Each Grid is a matrix size INT<0,63> by INT<0,63> filled with\nINT<0,15> values.\n\nYou are playing a game called LockSmith. Rules and strategy:\n* RESET: start over, ACTION1: move up, ACTION2: move down, ACTION3: move left, ACTION4: move right (ACTION5 and ACTION6 do nothing in this game)\n* you may may one action per turn\n* your goal is find and collect a matching key then touch the exit door\n* 6 levels total, score shows which level, complete all levels to win (grid row 62)\n* start each level with limited energy. you GAME_OVER if you run out (grid row 61)\n* the player is a 4x4 square: [[X,X,X,X],[0,0,0,X],[4,4,4,X],[4,4,4,X]] where X is transparent to the background\n* the grid represents a birds-eye view of the level\n* walls are made of INT<10>, you cannot move through a wall\n* walkable floor area is INT<8>\n* you can refill energy by touching energy pills (a 2x2 of INT<6>)\n* current key is shown in bottom-left of entire grid\n* the exit door is a 4x4 square with INT<11> border\n* to find a new key shape, touch the key rotator, a 4x4 square denoted by INT<9> and INT<4> in the top-left corner of the square\n* to find a new key color, touch the color rotator, a 4x4 square denoted by INT<9> and INT<2> and in the bottom-left corner of the square\n* to rotate more than once, move 1 space away from the rotator and back on\n* continue rotating the shape and color of the key until the key matches the one inside the exit door (scaled down 2X)\n* if the grid does not change after an action, you probably tried to move into a wall\n\nAn example of a good strategy observation:\nThe player 4x4 made of INT<4> and INT<0> is standing below a wall of INT<10>, so I cannot move up anymore and should\nmove left towards the rotator with INT<11>.\n\n# TURN:\nCall exactly one action.\n"

One Frame is made of one or more sequential\nGrids. Each Grid is a matrix size INT<0,63> by INT<0,63> filled with\nINT<0,15> values.\n\nYou are playing a game called LockSmith. Rules and strategy:\n* RESET: start over, ACTION1: move up, ACTION2: move down, ACTION3: move left, ACTION4: move right (ACTION5 and ACTION6 do nothing in this game)\n* you may may one action per turn\n* your goal is find and collect a matching key then touch the exit door\n* 6 levels total, score shows which level, complete all levels to win (grid row 62)\n* start each level with limited energy. you GAME_OVER if you run out (grid row 61)\n* the player is a 4x4 square: [[X,X,X,X],[0,0,0,X],[4,4,4,X],[4,4,4,X]] where X is transparent to the background\n* the grid represents a birds-eye view of the level\n* walls are made of INT<10>, you cannot move through a wall\n* walkable floor area is INT<8>\n* you can refill energy by touching energy pills (a 2x2 of INT<6>)\n* current key is shown in bottom-left of entire grid\n* the exit door is a 4x4 square with INT<11> border\n* to find a new key shape, touch the key rotator, a 4x4 square denoted by INT<9> and INT<4> in the top-left corner of the square\n* to find a new key color, touch the color rotator, a 4x4 square denoted by INT<9> and INT<2> and in the bottom-left corner of the square\n* to rotate more than once, move 1 space away from the rotator and back on\n* continue rotating the shape and color of the key until the key matches the one inside the exit door (scaled down 2X)\n* if the grid does not change after an action, you probably tried to move into a wall\n\nAn example of a good strategy observation:\nThe player 4x4 made of INT<4> and INT<0> is standing below a wall of INT<10>, so I cannot move up anymore and should\nmove left towards the rotator with INT<11>.\n\n# TURN:\nCall exactly one action.\n"

One Frame is made of one or more sequential\nGrids. Each Grid is a matrix size INT<0,63> by INT<0,63> filled with\nINT<0,15> values.\n\nYou are playing a game called LockSmith. Rules and strategy:\n* RESET: start over, ACTION1: move up, ACTION2: move down, ACTION3: move left, ACTION4: move right (ACTION5 and ACTION6 do nothing in this game)\n* you may may one action per turn\n* your goal is find and collect a matching key then touch the exit door\n* 6 levels total, score shows which level, complete all levels to win (grid row 62)\n* start each level with limited energy. you GAME_OVER if you run out (grid row 61)\n* the player is a 4x4 square: [[X,X,X,X],[0,0,0,X],[4,4,4,X],[4,4,4,X]] where X is transparent to the background\n* the grid represents a birds-eye view of the level\n* walls are made of INT<10>, you cannot move through a wall\n* walkable floor area is INT<8>\n* you can refill energy by touching energy pills (a 2x2 of INT<6>)\n* current key is shown in bottom-left of entire grid\n* the exit door is a 4x4 square with INT<11> border\n* to find a new key shape, touch the key rotator, a 4x4 square denoted by INT<9> and INT<4> in the top-left corner of the square\n* to find a new key color, touch the color rotator, a 4x4 square denoted by INT<9> and INT<2> and in the bottom-left corner of the square\n* to rotate more than once, move 1 space away from the rotator and back on\n* continue rotating the shape and color of the key until the key matches the one inside the exit door (scaled down 2X)\n* if the grid does not change after an action, you probably tried to move into a wall\n\nAn example of a good strategy observation:\nThe player 4x4 made of INT<4> and INT<0> is standing below a wall of INT<10>, so I cannot move up anymore and should\nmove left towards the rotator with INT<11>.\n\n# TURN:\nCall exactly one action.\n"

One Frame is made of one or more sequential\nGrids. Each Grid is a matrix size INT<0,63> by INT<0,63> filled with\nINT<0,15> values.\n\nYou are playing a game called LockSmith. Rules and strategy:\n* RESET: start over, ACTION1: move up, ACTION2: move down, ACTION3: move left, ACTION4: move right (ACTION5 and ACTION6 do nothing in this game)\n* you may may one action per turn\n* your goal is find and collect a matching key then touch the exit door\n* 6 levels total, score shows which level, complete all levels to win (grid row 62)\n* start each level with limited energy. you GAME_OVER if you run out (grid row 61)\n* the player is a 4x4 square: [[X,X,X,X],[0,0,0,X],[4,4,4,X],[4,4,4,X]] where X is transparent to the background\n* the grid represents a birds-eye view of the level\n* walls are made of INT<10>, you cannot move through a wall\n* walkable floor area is INT<8>\n* you can refill energy by touching energy pills (a 2x2 of INT<6>)\n* current key is shown in bottom-left of entire grid\n* the exit door is a 4x4 square with INT<11> border\n* to find a new key shape, touch the key rotator, a 4x4 square denoted by INT<9> and INT<4> in the top-left corner of the square\n* to find a new key color, touch the color rotator, a 4x4 square denoted by INT<9> and INT<2> and in the bottom-left corner of the square\n* to rotate more than once, move 1 space away from the rotator and back on\n* continue rotating the shape and color of the key until the key matches the one inside the exit door (scaled down 2X)\n* if the grid does not change after an action, you probably tried to move into a wall\n\nAn example of a good strategy observation:\nThe player 4x4 made of INT<4> and INT<0> is standing below a wall of INT<10>, so I cannot move up anymore and should\nmove left towards the rotator with INT<11>.\n\n# TURN:\nCall exactly one action.\n"

One Frame is made of one or more sequential\nGrids. Each Grid is a matrix size INT<0,63> by INT<0,63> filled with\nINT<0,15> values.\n\nYou are playing a game called LockSmith. Rules and strategy:\n* RESET: start over, ACTION1: move up, ACTION2: move down, ACTION3: move left, ACTION4: move right (ACTION5 and ACTION6 do nothing in this game)\n* you may may one action per turn\n* your goal is find and collect a matching key then touch the exit door\n* 6 levels total, score shows which level, complete all levels to win (grid row 62)\n* start each level with limited energy. you GAME_OVER if you run out (grid row 61)\n* the player is a 4x4 square: [[X,X,X,X],[0,0,0,X],[4,4,4,X],[4,4,4,X]] where X is transparent to the background\n* the grid represents a birds-eye view of the level\n* walls are made of INT<10>, you cannot move through a wall\n* walkable floor area is INT<8>\n* you can refill energy by touching energy pills (a 2x2 of INT<6>)\n* current key is shown in bottom-left of entire grid\n* the exit door is a 4x4 square with INT<11> border\n* to find a new key shape, touch the key rotator, a 4x4 square denoted by INT<9> and INT<4> in the top-left corner of the square\n* to find a new key color, touch the color rotator, a 4x4 square denoted by INT<9> and INT<2> and in the bottom-left corner of the square\n* to rotate more than once, move 1 space away from the rotator and back on\n* continue rotating the shape and color of the key until the key matches the one inside the exit door (scaled down 2X)\n* if the grid does not change after an action, you probably tried to move into a wall\n\nAn example of a good strategy observation:\nThe player 4x4 made of INT<4> and INT<0> is standing below a wall of INT<10>, so I cannot move up anymore and should\nmove left towards the rotator with INT<11>.\n\n# TURN:\nCall exactly one action.\n"

One Frame is made of one or more sequential\nGrids. Each Grid is a matrix size INT<0,63> by INT<0,63> filled with\nINT<0,15> values.\n\nYou are playing a game called LockSmith. Rules and strategy:\n* RESET: start over, ACTION1: move up, ACTION2: move down, ACTION3: move left, ACTION4: move right (ACTION5 and ACTION6 do nothing in this game)\n* you may may one action per turn\n* your goal is find and collect a matching key then touch the exit door\n* 6 levels total, score shows which level, complete all levels to win (grid row 62)\n* start each level with limited energy. you GAME_OVER if you run out (grid row 61)\n* the player is a 4x4 square: [[X,X,X,X],[0,0,0,X],[4,4,4,X],[4,4,4,X]] where X is transparent to the background\n* the grid represents a birds-eye view of the level\n* walls are made of INT<10>, you cannot move through a wall\n* walkable floor area is INT<8>\n* you can refill energy by touching energy pills (a 2x2 of INT<6>)\n* current key is shown in bottom-left of entire grid\n* the exit door is a 4x4 square with INT<11> border\n* to find a new key shape, touch the key rotator, a 4x4 square denoted by INT<9> and INT<4> in the top-left corner of the square\n* to find a new key color, touch the color rotator, a 4x4 square denoted by INT<9> and INT<2> and in the bottom-left corner of the square\n* to rotate more than once, move 1 space away from the rotator and back on\n* continue rotating the shape and color of the key until the key matches the one inside the exit door (scaled down 2X)\n* if the grid does not change after an action, you probably tried to move into a wall\n\nAn example of a good strategy observation:\nThe player 4x4 made of INT<4> and INT<0> is standing below a wall of INT<10>, so I cannot move up anymore and should\nmove left towards the rotator with INT<11>.\n\n# TURN:\nCall exactly one action.\n"

One Frame is made of one or more sequential\nGrids. Each Grid is a matrix size INT<0,63> by INT<0,63> filled with\nINT<0,15> values.\n\nYou are playing a game called LockSmith. Rules and strategy:\n* RESET: start over, ACTION1: move up, ACTION2: move down, ACTION3: move left, ACTION4: move right (ACTION5 and ACTION6 do nothing in this game)\n* you may may one action per turn\n* your goal is find and collect a matching key then touch the exit door\n* 6 levels total, score shows which level, complete all levels to win (grid row 62)\n* start each level with limited energy. you GAME_OVER if you run out (grid row 61)\n* the player is a 4x4 square: [[X,X,X,X],[0,0,0,X],[4,4,4,X],[4,4,4,X]] where X is transparent to the background\n* the grid represents a birds-eye view of the level\n* walls are made of INT<10>, you cannot move through a wall\n* walkable floor area is INT<8>\n* you can refill energy by touching energy pills (a 2x2 of INT<6>)\n* current key is shown in bottom-left of entire grid\n* the exit door is a 4x4 square with INT<11> border\n* to find a new key shape, touch the key rotator, a 4x4 square denoted by INT<9> and INT<4> in the top-left corner of the square\n* to find a new key color, touch the color rotator, a 4x4 square denoted by INT<9> and INT<2> and in the bottom-left corner of the square\n* to rotate more than once, move 1 space away from the rotator and back on\n* continue rotating the shape and color of the key until the key matches the one inside the exit door (scaled down 2X)\n* if the grid does not change after an action, you probably tried to move into a wall\n\nAn example of a good strategy observation:\nThe player 4x4 made of INT<4> and INT<0> is standing below a wall of INT<10>, so I cannot move up anymore and should\nmove left towards the rotator with INT<11>.\n\n# TURN:\nCall exactly one action.\n"

One Frame is made of one or more sequential\nGrids. Each Grid is a matrix size INT<0,63> by INT<0,63> filled with\nINT<0,15> values.\n\nYou are playing a game called LockSmith. Rules and strategy:\n* RESET: start over, ACTION1: move up, ACTION2: move down, ACTION3: move left, ACTION4: move right (ACTION5 and ACTION6 do nothing in this game)\n* you may may one action per turn\n* your goal is find and collect a matching key then touch the exit door\n* 6 levels total, score shows which level, complete all levels to win (grid row 62)\n* start each level with limited energy. you GAME_OVER if you run out (grid row 61)\n* the player is a 4x4 square: [[X,X,X,X],[0,0,0,X],[4,4,4,X],[4,4,4,X]] where X is transparent to the background\n* the grid represents a birds-eye view of the level\n* walls are made of INT<10>, you cannot move through a wall\n* walkable floor area is INT<8>\n* you can refill energy by touching energy pills (a 2x2 of INT<6>)\n* current key is shown in bottom-left of entire grid\n* the exit door is a 4x4 square with INT<11> border\n* to find a new key shape, touch the key rotator, a 4x4 square denoted by INT<9> and INT<4> in the top-left corner of the square\n* to find a new key color, touch the color rotator, a 4x4 square denoted by INT<9> and INT<2> and in the bottom-left corner of the square\n* to rotate more than once, move 1 space away from the rotator and back on\n* continue rotating the shape and color of the key until the key matches the one inside the exit door (scaled down 2X)\n* if the grid does not change after an action, you probably tried to move into a wall\n\nAn example of a good strategy observation:\nThe player 4x4 made of INT<4> and INT<0> is standing below a wall of INT<10>, so I cannot move up anymore and should\nmove left towards the rotator with INT<11>.\n\n# TURN:\nCall exactly one action.\n"

One Frame is made of one or more sequential\nGrids. Each Grid is a matrix size INT<0,63> by INT<0,63> filled with\nINT<0,15> values.\n\nYou are playing a game called LockSmith. Rules and strategy:\n* RESET: start over, ACTION1: move up, ACTION2: move down, ACTION3: move left, ACTION4: move right (ACTION5 and ACTION6 do nothing in this game)\n* you may may one action per turn\n* your goal is find and collect a matching key then touch the exit door\n* 6 levels total, score shows which level, complete all levels to win (grid row 62)\n* start each level with limited energy. you GAME_OVER if you run out (grid row 61)\n* the player is a 4x4 square: [[X,X,X,X],[0,0,0,X],[4,4,4,X],[4,4,4,X]] where X is transparent to the background\n* the grid represents a birds-eye view of the level\n* walls are made of INT<10>, you cannot move through a wall\n* walkable floor area is INT<8>\n* you can refill energy by touching energy pills (a 2x2 of INT<6>)\n* current key is shown in bottom-left of entire grid\n* the exit door is a 4x4 square with INT<11> border\n* to find a new key shape, touch the key rotator, a 4x4 square denoted by INT<9> and INT<4> in the top-left corner of the square\n* to find a new key color, touch the color rotator, a 4x4 square denoted by INT<9> and INT<2> and in the bottom-left corner of the square\n* to rotate more than once, move 1 space away from the rotator and back on\n* continue rotating the shape and color of the key until the key matches the one inside the exit door (scaled down 2X)\n* if the grid does not change after an action, you probably tried to move into a wall\n\nAn example of a good strategy observation:\nThe player 4x4 made of INT<4> and INT<0> is standing below a wall of INT<10>, so I cannot move up anymore and should\nmove left towards the rotator with INT<11>.\n\n# TURN:\nCall exactly one action.\n"

One Frame is made of one or more sequential\nGrids. Each Grid is a matrix size INT<0,63> by INT<0,63> filled with\nINT<0,15> values.\n\nYou are playing a game called LockSmith. Rules and strategy:\n* RESET: start over, ACTION1: move up, ACTION2: move down, ACTION3: move left, ACTION4: move right (ACTION5 and ACTION6 do nothing in this game)\n* you may may one action per turn\n* your goal is find and collect a matching key then touch the exit door\n* 6 levels total, score shows which level, complete all levels to win (grid row 62)\n* start each level with limited energy. you GAME_OVER if you run out (grid row 61)\n* the player is a 4x4 square: [[X,X,X,X],[0,0,0,X],[4,4,4,X],[4,4,4,X]] where X is transparent to the background\n* the grid represents a birds-eye view of the level\n* walls are made of INT<10>, you cannot move through a wall\n* walkable floor area is INT<8>\n* you can refill energy by touching energy pills (a 2x2 of INT<6>)\n* current key is shown in bottom-left of entire grid\n* the exit door is a 4x4 square with INT<11> border\n* to find a new key shape, touch the key rotator, a 4x4 square denoted by INT<9> and INT<4> in the top-left corner of the square\n* to find a new key color, touch the color rotator, a 4x4 square denoted by INT<9> and INT<2> and in the bottom-left corner of the square\n* to rotate more than once, move 1 space away from the rotator and back on\n* continue rotating the shape and color of the key until the key matches the one inside the exit door (scaled down 2X)\n* if the grid does not change after an action, you probably tried to move into a wall\n\nAn example of a good strategy observation:\nThe player 4x4 made of INT<4> and INT<0> is standing below a wall of INT<10>, so I cannot move up anymore and should\nmove left towards the rotator with INT<11>.\n\n# TURN:\nCall exactly one action.\n"

One Frame is made of one or more sequential\nGrids. Each Grid is a matrix size INT<0,63> by INT<0,63> filled with\nINT<0,15> values.\n\nYou are playing a game called LockSmith. Rules and strategy:\n* RESET: start over, ACTION1: move up, ACTION2: move down, ACTION3: move left, ACTION4: move right (ACTION5 and ACTION6 do nothing in this game)\n* you may may one action per turn\n* your goal is find and collect a matching key then touch the exit door\n* 6 levels total, score shows which level, complete all levels to win (grid row 62)\n* start each level with limited energy. you GAME_OVER if you run out (grid row 61)\n* the player is a 4x4 square: [[X,X,X,X],[0,0,0,X],[4,4,4,X],[4,4,4,X]] where X is transparent to the background\n* the grid represents a birds-eye view of the level\n* walls are made of INT<10>, you cannot move through a wall\n* walkable floor area is INT<8>\n* you can refill energy by touching energy pills (a 2x2 of INT<6>)\n* current key is shown in bottom-left of entire grid\n* the exit door is a 4x4 square with INT<11> border\n* to find a new key shape, touch the key rotator, a 4x4 square denoted by INT<9> and INT<4> in the top-left corner of the square\n* to find a new key color, touch the color rotator, a 4x4 square denoted by INT<9> and INT<2> and in the bottom-left corner of the square\n* to rotate more than once, move 1 space away from the rotator and back on\n* continue rotating the shape and color of the key until the key matches the one inside the exit door (scaled down 2X)\n* if the grid does not change after an action, you probably tried to move into a wall\n\nAn example of a good strategy observation:\nThe player 4x4 made of INT<4> and INT<0> is standing below a wall of INT<10>, so I cannot move up anymore and should\nmove left towards the rotator with INT<11>.\n\n# TURN:\nCall exactly one action.\n"

One Frame is made of one or more sequential\nGrids. Each Grid is a matrix size INT<0,63> by INT<0,63> filled with\nINT<0,15> values.\n\nYou are playing a game called LockSmith. Rules and strategy:\n* RESET: start over, ACTION1: move up, ACTION2: move down, ACTION3: move left, ACTION4: move right (ACTION5 and ACTION6 do nothing in this game)\n* you may may one action per turn\n* your goal is find and collect a matching key then touch the exit door\n* 6 levels total, score shows which level, complete all levels to win (grid row 62)\n* start each level with limited energy. you GAME_OVER if you run out (grid row 61)\n* the player is a 4x4 square: [[X,X,X,X],[0,0,0,X],[4,4,4,X],[4,4,4,X]] where X is transparent to the background\n* the grid represents a birds-eye view of the level\n* walls are made of INT<10>, you cannot move through a wall\n* walkable floor area is INT<8>\n* you can refill energy by touching energy pills (a 2x2 of INT<6>)\n* current key is shown in bottom-left of entire grid\n* the exit door is a 4x4 square with INT<11> border\n* to find a new key shape, touch the key rotator, a 4x4 square denoted by INT<9> and INT<4> in the top-left corner of the square\n* to find a new key color, touch the color rotator, a 4x4 square denoted by INT<9> and INT<2> and in the bottom-left corner of the square\n* to rotate more than once, move 1 space away from the rotator and back on\n* continue rotating the shape and color of the key until the key matches the one inside the exit door (scaled down 2X)\n* if the grid does not change after an action, you probably tried to move into a wall\n\nAn example of a good strategy observation:\nThe player 4x4 made of INT<4> and INT<0> is standing below a wall of INT<10>, so I cannot move up anymore and should\nmove left towards the rotator with INT<11>.\n\n# TURN:\nCall exactly one action.\n"

To cycle the key again, I should move one tile off the rotator (to the right onto floor) and then step back onto it. Priority: step right once to set up another rotation."

One Frame is made of one or more sequential\nGrids. Each Grid is a matrix size INT<0,63> by INT<0,63> filled with\nINT<0,15> values.\n\nYou are playing a game called LockSmith. Rules and strategy:\n* RESET: start over, ACTION1: move up, ACTION2: move down, ACTION3: move left, ACTION4: move right (ACTION5 and ACTION6 do nothing in this game)\n* you may may one action per turn\n* your goal is find and collect a matching key then touch the exit door\n* 6 levels total, score shows which level, complete all levels to win (grid row 62)\n* start each level with limited energy. you GAME_OVER if you run out (grid row 61)\n* the player is a 4x4 square: [[X,X,X,X],[0,0,0,X],[4,4,4,X],[4,4,4,X]] where X is transparent to the background\n* the grid represents a birds-eye view of the level\n* walls are made of INT<10>, you cannot move through a wall\n* walkable floor area is INT<8>\n* you can refill energy by touching energy pills (a 2x2 of INT<6>)\n* current key is shown in bottom-left of entire grid\n* the exit door is a 4x4 square with INT<11> border\n* to find a new key shape, touch the key rotator, a 4x4 square denoted by INT<9> and INT<4> in the top-left corner of the square\n* to find a new key color, touch the color rotator, a 4x4 square denoted by INT<9> and INT<2> and in the bottom-left corner of the square\n* to rotate more than once, move 1 space away from the rotator and back on\n* continue rotating the shape and color of the key until the key matches the one inside the exit door (scaled down 2X)\n* if the grid does not change after an action, you probably tried to move into a wall\n\nAn example of a good strategy observation:\nThe player 4x4 made of INT<4> and INT<0> is standing below a wall of INT<10>, so I cannot move up anymore and should\nmove left towards the rotator with INT<11>.\n\n# TURN:\nCall exactly one action.\n"

One Frame is made of one or more sequential\nGrids. Each Grid is a matrix size INT<0,63> by INT<0,63> filled with\nINT<0,15> values.\n\nYou are playing a game called LockSmith. Rules and strategy:\n* RESET: start over, ACTION1: move up, ACTION2: move down, ACTION3: move left, ACTION4: move right (ACTION5 and ACTION6 do nothing in this game)\n* you may may one action per turn\n* your goal is find and collect a matching key then touch the exit door\n* 6 levels total, score shows which level, complete all levels to win (grid row 62)\n* start each level with limited energy. you GAME_OVER if you run out (grid row 61)\n* the player is a 4x4 square: [[X,X,X,X],[0,0,0,X],[4,4,4,X],[4,4,4,X]] where X is transparent to the background\n* the grid represents a birds-eye view of the level\n* walls are made of INT<10>, you cannot move through a wall\n* walkable floor area is INT<8>\n* you can refill energy by touching energy pills (a 2x2 of INT<6>)\n* current key is shown in bottom-left of entire grid\n* the exit door is a 4x4 square with INT<11> border\n* to find a new key shape, touch the key rotator, a 4x4 square denoted by INT<9> and INT<4> in the top-left corner of the square\n* to find a new key color, touch the color rotator, a 4x4 square denoted by INT<9> and INT<2> and in the bottom-left corner of the square\n* to rotate more than once, move 1 space away from the rotator and back on\n* continue rotating the shape and color of the key until the key matches the one inside the exit door (scaled down 2X)\n* if the grid does not change after an action, you probably tried to move into a wall\n\nAn example of a good strategy observation:\nThe player 4x4 made of INT<4> and INT<0> is standing below a wall of INT<10>, so I cannot move up anymore and should\nmove left towards the rotator with INT<11>.\n\n# TURN:\nCall exactly one action.\n"

One Frame is made of one or more sequential\nGrids. Each Grid is a matrix size INT<0,63> by INT<0,63> filled with\nINT<0,15> values.\n\nYou are playing a game called LockSmith. Rules and strategy:\n* RESET: start over, ACTION1: move up, ACTION2: move down, ACTION3: move left, ACTION4: move right (ACTION5 and ACTION6 do nothing in this game)\n* you may may one action per turn\n* your goal is find and collect a matching key then touch the exit door\n* 6 levels total, score shows which level, complete all levels to win (grid row 62)\n* start each level with limited energy. you GAME_OVER if you run out (grid row 61)\n* the player is a 4x4 square: [[X,X,X,X],[0,0,0,X],[4,4,4,X],[4,4,4,X]] where X is transparent to the background\n* the grid represents a birds-eye view of the level\n* walls are made of INT<10>, you cannot move through a wall\n* walkable floor area is INT<8>\n* you can refill energy by touching energy pills (a 2x2 of INT<6>)\n* current key is shown in bottom-left of entire grid\n* the exit door is a 4x4 square with INT<11> border\n* to find a new key shape, touch the key rotator, a 4x4 square denoted by INT<9> and INT<4> in the top-left corner of the square\n* to find a new key color, touch the color rotator, a 4x4 square denoted by INT<9> and INT<2> and in the bottom-left corner of the square\n* to rotate more than once, move 1 space away from the rotator and back on\n* continue rotating the shape and color of the key until the key matches the one inside the exit door (scaled down 2X)\n* if the grid does not change after an action, you probably tried to move into a wall\n\nAn example of a good strategy observation:\nThe player 4x4 made of INT<4> and INT<0> is standing below a wall of INT<10>, so I cannot move up anymore and should\nmove left towards the rotator with INT<11>.\n\n# TURN:\nCall exactly one action.\n"

One Frame is made of one or more sequential\nGrids. Each Grid is a matrix size INT<0,63> by INT<0,63> filled with\nINT<0,15> values.\n\nYou are playing a game called LockSmith. Rules and strategy:\n* RESET: start over, ACTION1: move up, ACTION2: move down, ACTION3: move left, ACTION4: move right (ACTION5 and ACTION6 do nothing in this game)\n* you may may one action per turn\n* your goal is find and collect a matching key then touch the exit door\n* 6 levels total, score shows which level, complete all levels to win (grid row 62)\n* start each level with limited energy. you GAME_OVER if you run out (grid row 61)\n* the player is a 4x4 square: [[X,X,X,X],[0,0,0,X],[4,4,4,X],[4,4,4,X]] where X is transparent to the background\n* the grid represents a birds-eye view of the level\n* walls are made of INT<10>, you cannot move through a wall\n* walkable floor area is INT<8>\n* you can refill energy by touching energy pills (a 2x2 of INT<6>)\n* current key is shown in bottom-left of entire grid\n* the exit door is a 4x4 square with INT<11> border\n* to find a new key shape, touch the key rotator, a 4x4 square denoted by INT<9> and INT<4> in the top-left corner of the square\n* to find a new key color, touch the color rotator, a 4x4 square denoted by INT<9> and INT<2> and in the bottom-left corner of the square\n* to rotate more than once, move 1 space away from the rotator and back on\n* continue rotating the shape and color of the key until the key matches the one inside the exit door (scaled down 2X)\n* if the grid does not change after an action, you probably tried to move into a wall\n\nAn example of a good strategy observation:\nThe player 4x4 made of INT<4> and INT<0> is standing below a wall of INT<10>, so I cannot move up anymore and should\nmove left towards the rotator with INT<11>.\n\n# TURN:\nCall exactly one action.\n"

One Frame is made of one or more sequential\nGrids. Each Grid is a matrix size INT<0,63> by INT<0,63> filled with\nINT<0,15> values.\n\nYou are playing a game called LockSmith. Rules and strategy:\n* RESET: start over, ACTION1: move up, ACTION2: move down, ACTION3: move left, ACTION4: move right (ACTION5 and ACTION6 do nothing in this game)\n* you may may one action per turn\n* your goal is find and collect a matching key then touch the exit door\n* 6 levels total, score shows which level, complete all levels to win (grid row 62)\n* start each level with limited energy. you GAME_OVER if you run out (grid row 61)\n* the player is a 4x4 square: [[X,X,X,X],[0,0,0,X],[4,4,4,X],[4,4,4,X]] where X is transparent to the background\n* the grid represents a birds-eye view of the level\n* walls are made of INT<10>, you cannot move through a wall\n* walkable floor area is INT<8>\n* you can refill energy by touching energy pills (a 2x2 of INT<6>)\n* current key is shown in bottom-left of entire grid\n* the exit door is a 4x4 square with INT<11> border\n* to find a new key shape, touch the key rotator, a 4x4 square denoted by INT<9> and INT<4> in the top-left corner of the square\n* to find a new key color, touch the color rotator, a 4x4 square denoted by INT<9> and INT<2> and in the bottom-left corner of the square\n* to rotate more than once, move 1 space away from the rotator and back on\n* continue rotating the shape and color of the key until the key matches the one inside the exit door (scaled down 2X)\n* if the grid does not change after an action, you probably tried to move into a wall\n\nAn example of a good strategy observation:\nThe player 4x4 made of INT<4> and INT<0> is standing below a wall of INT<10>, so I cannot move up anymore and should\nmove left towards the rotator with INT<11>.\n\n# TURN:\nCall exactly one action.\n"

One Frame is made of one or more sequential\nGrids. Each Grid is a matrix size INT<0,63> by INT<0,63> filled with\nINT<0,15> values.\n\nYou are playing a game called LockSmith. Rules and strategy:\n* RESET: start over, ACTION1: move up, ACTION2: move down, ACTION3: move left, ACTION4: move right (ACTION5 and ACTION6 do nothing in this game)\n* you may may one action per turn\n* your goal is find and collect a matching key then touch the exit door\n* 6 levels total, score shows which level, complete all levels to win (grid row 62)\n* start each level with limited energy. you GAME_OVER if you run out (grid row 61)\n* the player is a 4x4 square: [[X,X,X,X],[0,0,0,X],[4,4,4,X],[4,4,4,X]] where X is transparent to the background\n* the grid represents a birds-eye view of the level\n* walls are made of INT<10>, you cannot move through a wall\n* walkable floor area is INT<8>\n* you can refill energy by touching energy pills (a 2x2 of INT<6>)\n* current key is shown in bottom-left of entire grid\n* the exit door is a 4x4 square with INT<11> border\n* to find a new key shape, touch the key rotator, a 4x4 square denoted by INT<9> and INT<4> in the top-left corner of the square\n* to find a new key color, touch the color rotator, a 4x4 square denoted by INT<9> and INT<2> and in the bottom-left corner of the square\n* to rotate more than once, move 1 space away from the rotator and back on\n* continue rotating the shape and color of the key until the key matches the one inside the exit door (scaled down 2X)\n* if the grid does not change after an action, you probably tried to move into a wall\n\nAn example of a good strategy observation:\nThe player 4x4 made of INT<4> and INT<0> is standing below a wall of INT<10>, so I cannot move up anymore and should\nmove left towards the rotator with INT<11>.\n\n# TURN:\nCall exactly one action.\n"

One Frame is made of one or more sequential\nGrids. Each Grid is a matrix size INT<0,63> by INT<0,63> filled with\nINT<0,15> values.\n\nYou are playing a game called LockSmith. Rules and strategy:\n* RESET: start over, ACTION1: move up, ACTION2: move down, ACTION3: move left, ACTION4: move right (ACTION5 and ACTION6 do nothing in this game)\n* you may may one action per turn\n* your goal is find and collect a matching key then touch the exit door\n* 6 levels total, score shows which level, complete all levels to win (grid row 62)\n* start each level with limited energy. you GAME_OVER if you run out (grid row 61)\n* the player is a 4x4 square: [[X,X,X,X],[0,0,0,X],[4,4,4,X],[4,4,4,X]] where X is transparent to the background\n* the grid represents a birds-eye view of the level\n* walls are made of INT<10>, you cannot move through a wall\n* walkable floor area is INT<8>\n* you can refill energy by touching energy pills (a 2x2 of INT<6>)\n* current key is shown in bottom-left of entire grid\n* the exit door is a 4x4 square with INT<11> border\n* to find a new key shape, touch the key rotator, a 4x4 square denoted by INT<9> and INT<4> in the top-left corner of the square\n* to find a new key color, touch the color rotator, a 4x4 square denoted by INT<9> and INT<2> and in the bottom-left corner of the square\n* to rotate more than once, move 1 space away from the rotator and back on\n* continue rotating the shape and color of the key until the key matches the one inside the exit door (scaled down 2X)\n* if the grid does not change after an action, you probably tried to move into a wall\n\nAn example of a good strategy observation:\nThe player 4x4 made of INT<4> and INT<0> is standing below a wall of INT<10>, so I cannot move up anymore and should\nmove left towards the rotator with INT<11>.\n\n# TURN:\nCall exactly one action.\n"

One Frame is made of one or more sequential\nGrids. Each Grid is a matrix size INT<0,63> by INT<0,63> filled with\nINT<0,15> values.\n\nYou are playing a game called LockSmith. Rules and strategy:\n* RESET: start over, ACTION1: move up, ACTION2: move down, ACTION3: move left, ACTION4: move right (ACTION5 and ACTION6 do nothing in this game)\n* you may may one action per turn\n* your goal is find and collect a matching key then touch the exit door\n* 6 levels total, score shows which level, complete all levels to win (grid row 62)\n* start each level with limited energy. you GAME_OVER if you run out (grid row 61)\n* the player is a 4x4 square: [[X,X,X,X],[0,0,0,X],[4,4,4,X],[4,4,4,X]] where X is transparent to the background\n* the grid represents a birds-eye view of the level\n* walls are made of INT<10>, you cannot move through a wall\n* walkable floor area is INT<8>\n* you can refill energy by touching energy pills (a 2x2 of INT<6>)\n* current key is shown in bottom-left of entire grid\n* the exit door is a 4x4 square with INT<11> border\n* to find a new key shape, touch the key rotator, a 4x4 square denoted by INT<9> and INT<4> in the top-left corner of the square\n* to find a new key color, touch the color rotator, a 4x4 square denoted by INT<9> and INT<2> and in the bottom-left corner of the square\n* to rotate more than once, move 1 space away from the rotator and back on\n* continue rotating the shape and color of the key until the key matches the one inside the exit door (scaled down 2X)\n* if the grid does not change after an action, you probably tried to move into a wall\n\nAn example of a good strategy observation:\nThe player 4x4 made of INT<4> and INT<0> is standing below a wall of INT<10>, so I cannot move up anymore and should\nmove left towards the rotator with INT<11>.\n\n# TURN:\nCall exactly one action.\n"

One Frame is made of one or more sequential\nGrids. Each Grid is a matrix size INT<0,63> by INT<0,63> filled with\nINT<0,15> values.\n\nYou are playing a game called LockSmith. Rules and strategy:\n* RESET: start over, ACTION1: move up, ACTION2: move down, ACTION3: move left, ACTION4: move right (ACTION5 and ACTION6 do nothing in this game)\n* you may may one action per turn\n* your goal is find and collect a matching key then touch the exit door\n* 6 levels total, score shows which level, complete all levels to win (grid row 62)\n* start each level with limited energy. you GAME_OVER if you run out (grid row 61)\n* the player is a 4x4 square: [[X,X,X,X],[0,0,0,X],[4,4,4,X],[4,4,4,X]] where X is transparent to the background\n* the grid represents a birds-eye view of the level\n* walls are made of INT<10>, you cannot move through a wall\n* walkable floor area is INT<8>\n* you can refill energy by touching energy pills (a 2x2 of INT<6>)\n* current key is shown in bottom-left of entire grid\n* the exit door is a 4x4 square with INT<11> border\n* to find a new key shape, touch the key rotator, a 4x4 square denoted by INT<9> and INT<4> in the top-left corner of the square\n* to find a new key color, touch the color rotator, a 4x4 square denoted by INT<9> and INT<2> and in the bottom-left corner of the square\n* to rotate more than once, move 1 space away from the rotator and back on\n* continue rotating the shape and color of the key until the key matches the one inside the exit door (scaled down 2X)\n* if the grid does not change after an action, you probably tried to move into a wall\n\nAn example of a good strategy observation:\nThe player 4x4 made of INT<4> and INT<0> is standing below a wall of INT<10>, so I cannot move up anymore and should\nmove left towards the rotator with INT<11>.\n\n# TURN:\nCall exactly one action.\n"

One Frame is made of one or more sequential\nGrids. Each Grid is a matrix size INT<0,63> by INT<0,63> filled with\nINT<0,15> values.\n\nYou are playing a game called LockSmith. Rules and strategy:\n* RESET: start over, ACTION1: move up, ACTION2: move down, ACTION3: move left, ACTION4: move right (ACTION5 and ACTION6 do nothing in this game)\n* you may may one action per turn\n* your goal is find and collect a matching key then touch the exit door\n* 6 levels total, score shows which level, complete all levels to win (grid row 62)\n* start each level with limited energy. you GAME_OVER if you run out (grid row 61)\n* the player is a 4x4 square: [[X,X,X,X],[0,0,0,X],[4,4,4,X],[4,4,4,X]] where X is transparent to the background\n* the grid represents a birds-eye view of the level\n* walls are made of INT<10>, you cannot move through a wall\n* walkable floor area is INT<8>\n* you can refill energy by touching energy pills (a 2x2 of INT<6>)\n* current key is shown in bottom-left of entire grid\n* the exit door is a 4x4 square with INT<11> border\n* to find a new key shape, touch the key rotator, a 4x4 square denoted by INT<9> and INT<4> in the top-left corner of the square\n* to find a new key color, touch the color rotator, a 4x4 square denoted by INT<9> and INT<2> and in the bottom-left corner of the square\n* to rotate more than once, move 1 space away from the rotator and back on\n* continue rotating the shape and color of the key until the key matches the one inside the exit door (scaled down 2X)\n* if the grid does not change after an action, you probably tried to move into a wall\n\nAn example of a good strategy observation:\nThe player 4x4 made of INT<4> and INT<0> is standing below a wall of INT<10>, so I cannot move up anymore and should\nmove left towards the rotator with INT<11>.\n\n# TURN:\nCall exactly one action.\n"

One Frame is made of one or more sequential\nGrids. Each Grid is a matrix size INT<0,63> by INT<0,63> filled with\nINT<0,15> values.\n\nYou are playing a game called LockSmith. Rules and strategy:\n* RESET: start over, ACTION1: move up, ACTION2: move down, ACTION3: move left, ACTION4: move right (ACTION5 and ACTION6 do nothing in this game)\n* you may may one action per turn\n* your goal is find and collect a matching key then touch the exit door\n* 6 levels total, score shows which level, complete all levels to win (grid row 62)\n* start each level with limited energy. you GAME_OVER if you run out (grid row 61)\n* the player is a 4x4 square: [[X,X,X,X],[0,0,0,X],[4,4,4,X],[4,4,4,X]] where X is transparent to the background\n* the grid represents a birds-eye view of the level\n* walls are made of INT<10>, you cannot move through a wall\n* walkable floor area is INT<8>\n* you can refill energy by touching energy pills (a 2x2 of INT<6>)\n* current key is shown in bottom-left of entire grid\n* the exit door is a 4x4 square with INT<11> border\n* to find a new key shape, touch the key rotator, a 4x4 square denoted by INT<9> and INT<4> in the top-left corner of the square\n* to find a new key color, touch the color rotator, a 4x4 square denoted by INT<9> and INT<2> and in the bottom-left corner of the square\n* to rotate more than once, move 1 space away from the rotator and back on\n* continue rotating the shape and color of the key until the key matches the one inside the exit door (scaled down 2X)\n* if the grid does not change after an action, you probably tried to move into a wall\n\nAn example of a good strategy observation:\nThe player 4x4 made of INT<4> and INT<0> is standing below a wall of INT<10>, so I cannot move up anymore and should\nmove left towards the rotator with INT<11>.\n\n# TURN:\nCall exactly one action.\n"

One Frame is made of one or more sequential\nGrids. Each Grid is a matrix size INT<0,63> by INT<0,63> filled with\nINT<0,15> values.\n\nYou are playing a game called LockSmith. Rules and strategy:\n* RESET: start over, ACTION1: move up, ACTION2: move down, ACTION3: move left, ACTION4: move right (ACTION5 and ACTION6 do nothing in this game)\n* you may may one action per turn\n* your goal is find and collect a matching key then touch the exit door\n* 6 levels total, score shows which level, complete all levels to win (grid row 62)\n* start each level with limited energy. you GAME_OVER if you run out (grid row 61)\n* the player is a 4x4 square: [[X,X,X,X],[0,0,0,X],[4,4,4,X],[4,4,4,X]] where X is transparent to the background\n* the grid represents a birds-eye view of the level\n* walls are made of INT<10>, you cannot move through a wall\n* walkable floor area is INT<8>\n* you can refill energy by touching energy pills (a 2x2 of INT<6>)\n* current key is shown in bottom-left of entire grid\n* the exit door is a 4x4 square with INT<11> border\n* to find a new key shape, touch the key rotator, a 4x4 square denoted by INT<9> and INT<4> in the top-left corner of the square\n* to find a new key color, touch the color rotator, a 4x4 square denoted by INT<9> and INT<2> and in the bottom-left corner of the square\n* to rotate more than once, move 1 space away from the rotator and back on\n* continue rotating the shape and color of the key until the key matches the one inside the exit door (scaled down 2X)\n* if the grid does not change after an action, you probably tried to move into a wall\n\nAn example of a good strategy observation:\nThe player 4x4 made of INT<4> and INT<0> is standing below a wall of INT<10>, so I cannot move up anymore and should\nmove left towards the rotator with INT<11>.\n\n# TURN:\nCall exactly one action.\n"

One Frame is made of one or more sequential\nGrids. Each Grid is a matrix size INT<0,63> by INT<0,63> filled with\nINT<0,15> values.\n\nYou are playing a game called LockSmith. Rules and strategy:\n* RESET: start over, ACTION1: move up, ACTION2: move down, ACTION3: move left, ACTION4: move right (ACTION5 and ACTION6 do nothing in this game)\n* you may may one action per turn\n* your goal is find and collect a matching key then touch the exit door\n* 6 levels total, score shows which level, complete all levels to win (grid row 62)\n* start each level with limited energy. you GAME_OVER if you run out (grid row 61)\n* the player is a 4x4 square: [[X,X,X,X],[0,0,0,X],[4,4,4,X],[4,4,4,X]] where X is transparent to the background\n* the grid represents a birds-eye view of the level\n* walls are made of INT<10>, you cannot move through a wall\n* walkable floor area is INT<8>\n* you can refill energy by touching energy pills (a 2x2 of INT<6>)\n* current key is shown in bottom-left of entire grid\n* the exit door is a 4x4 square with INT<11> border\n* to find a new key shape, touch the key rotator, a 4x4 square denoted by INT<9> and INT<4> in the top-left corner of the square\n* to find a new key color, touch the color rotator, a 4x4 square denoted by INT<9> and INT<2> and in the bottom-left corner of the square\n* to rotate more than once, move 1 space away from the rotator and back on\n* continue rotating the shape and color of the key until the key matches the one inside the exit door (scaled down 2X)\n* if the grid does not change after an action, you probably tried to move into a wall\n\nAn example of a good strategy observation:\nThe player 4x4 made of INT<4> and INT<0> is standing below a wall of INT<10>, so I cannot move up anymore and should\nmove left towards the rotator with INT<11>.\n\n# TURN:\nCall exactly one action.\n"

One Frame is made of one or more sequential\nGrids. Each Grid is a matrix size INT<0,63> by INT<0,63> filled with\nINT<0,15> values.\n\nYou are playing a game called LockSmith. Rules and strategy:\n* RESET: start over, ACTION1: move up, ACTION2: move down, ACTION3: move left, ACTION4: move right (ACTION5 and ACTION6 do nothing in this game)\n* you may may one action per turn\n* your goal is find and collect a matching key then touch the exit door\n* 6 levels total, score shows which level, complete all levels to win (grid row 62)\n* start each level with limited energy. you GAME_OVER if you run out (grid row 61)\n* the player is a 4x4 square: [[X,X,X,X],[0,0,0,X],[4,4,4,X],[4,4,4,X]] where X is transparent to the background\n* the grid represents a birds-eye view of the level\n* walls are made of INT<10>, you cannot move through a wall\n* walkable floor area is INT<8>\n* you can refill energy by touching energy pills (a 2x2 of INT<6>)\n* current key is shown in bottom-left of entire grid\n* the exit door is a 4x4 square with INT<11> border\n* to find a new key shape, touch the key rotator, a 4x4 square denoted by INT<9> and INT<4> in the top-left corner of the square\n* to find a new key color, touch the color rotator, a 4x4 square denoted by INT<9> and INT<2> and in the bottom-left corner of the square\n* to rotate more than once, move 1 space away from the rotator and back on\n* continue rotating the shape and color of the key until the key matches the one inside the exit door (scaled down 2X)\n* if the grid does not change after an action, you probably tried to move into a wall\n\nAn example of a good strategy observation:\nThe player 4x4 made of INT<4> and INT<0> is standing below a wall of INT<10>, so I cannot move up anymore and should\nmove left towards the rotator with INT<11>.\n\n# TURN:\nCall exactly one action.\n"

One Frame is made of one or more sequential\nGrids. Each Grid is a matrix size INT<0,63> by INT<0,63> filled with\nINT<0,15> values.\n\nYou are playing a game called LockSmith. Rules and strategy:\n* RESET: start over, ACTION1: move up, ACTION2: move down, ACTION3: move left, ACTION4: move right (ACTION5 and ACTION6 do nothing in this game)\n* you may may one action per turn\n* your goal is find and collect a matching key then touch the exit door\n* 6 levels total, score shows which level, complete all levels to win (grid row 62)\n* start each level with limited energy. you GAME_OVER if you run out (grid row 61)\n* the player is a 4x4 square: [[X,X,X,X],[0,0,0,X],[4,4,4,X],[4,4,4,X]] where X is transparent to the background\n* the grid represents a birds-eye view of the level\n* walls are made of INT<10>, you cannot move through a wall\n* walkable floor area is INT<8>\n* you can refill energy by touching energy pills (a 2x2 of INT<6>)\n* current key is shown in bottom-left of entire grid\n* the exit door is a 4x4 square with INT<11> border\n* to find a new key shape, touch the key rotator, a 4x4 square denoted by INT<9> and INT<4> in the top-left corner of the square\n* to find a new key color, touch the color rotator, a 4x4 square denoted by INT<9> and INT<2> and in the bottom-left corner of the square\n* to rotate more than once, move 1 space away from the rotator and back on\n* continue rotating the shape and color of the key until the key matches the one inside the exit door (scaled down 2X)\n* if the grid does not change after an action, you probably tried to move into a wall\n\nAn example of a good strategy observation:\nThe player 4x4 made of INT<4> and INT<0> is standing below a wall of INT<10>, so I cannot move up anymore and should\nmove left towards the rotator with INT<11>.\n\n# TURN:\nCall exactly one action.\n"

One Frame is made of one or more sequential\nGrids. Each Grid is a matrix size INT<0,63> by INT<0,63> filled with\nINT<0,15> values.\n\nYou are playing a game called LockSmith. Rules and strategy:\n* RESET: start over, ACTION1: move up, ACTION2: move down, ACTION3: move left, ACTION4: move right (ACTION5 and ACTION6 do nothing in this game)\n* you may may one action per turn\n* your goal is find and collect a matching key then touch the exit door\n* 6 levels total, score shows which level, complete all levels to win (grid row 62)\n* start each level with limited energy. you GAME_OVER if you run out (grid row 61)\n* the player is a 4x4 square: [[X,X,X,X],[0,0,0,X],[4,4,4,X],[4,4,4,X]] where X is transparent to the background\n* the grid represents a birds-eye view of the level\n* walls are made of INT<10>, you cannot move through a wall\n* walkable floor area is INT<8>\n* you can refill energy by touching energy pills (a 2x2 of INT<6>)\n* current key is shown in bottom-left of entire grid\n* the exit door is a 4x4 square with INT<11> border\n* to find a new key shape, touch the key rotator, a 4x4 square denoted by INT<9> and INT<4> in the top-left corner of the square\n* to find a new key color, touch the color rotator, a 4x4 square denoted by INT<9> and INT<2> and in the bottom-left corner of the square\n* to rotate more than once, move 1 space away from the rotator and back on\n* continue rotating the shape and color of the key until the key matches the one inside the exit door (scaled down 2X)\n* if the grid does not change after an action, you probably tried to move into a wall\n\nAn example of a good strategy observation:\nThe player 4x4 made of INT<4> and INT<0> is standing below a wall of INT<10>, so I cannot move up anymore and should\nmove left towards the rotator with INT<11>.\n\n# TURN:\nCall exactly one action.\n"

One Frame is made of one or more sequential\nGrids. Each Grid is a matrix size INT<0,63> by INT<0,63> filled with\nINT<0,15> values.\n\nYou are playing a game called LockSmith. Rules and strategy:\n* RESET: start over, ACTION1: move up, ACTION2: move down, ACTION3: move left, ACTION4: move right (ACTION5 and ACTION6 do nothing in this game)\n* you may may one action per turn\n* your goal is find and collect a matching key then touch the exit door\n* 6 levels total, score shows which level, complete all levels to win (grid row 62)\n* start each level with limited energy. you GAME_OVER if you run out (grid row 61)\n* the player is a 4x4 square: [[X,X,X,X],[0,0,0,X],[4,4,4,X],[4,4,4,X]] where X is transparent to the background\n* the grid represents a birds-eye view of the level\n* walls are made of INT<10>, you cannot move through a wall\n* walkable floor area is INT<8>\n* you can refill energy by touching energy pills (a 2x2 of INT<6>)\n* current key is shown in bottom-left of entire grid\n* the exit door is a 4x4 square with INT<11> border\n* to find a new key shape, touch the key rotator, a 4x4 square denoted by INT<9> and INT<4> in the top-left corner of the square\n* to find a new key color, touch the color rotator, a 4x4 square denoted by INT<9> and INT<2> and in the bottom-left corner of the square\n* to rotate more than once, move 1 space away from the rotator and back on\n* continue rotating the shape and color of the key until the key matches the one inside the exit door (scaled down 2X)\n* if the grid does not change after an action, you probably tried to move into a wall\n\nAn example of a good strategy observation:\nThe player 4x4 made of INT<4> and INT<0> is standing below a wall of INT<10>, so I cannot move up anymore and should\nmove left towards the rotator with INT<11>.\n\n# TURN:\nCall exactly one action.\n"

I don’t see any 11-bordered exit yet and no 10-walls blocking me. Best move is to step onto the 9s to trigger a rotation, then step off/on to cycle until I get the needed key."

One Frame is made of one or more sequential\nGrids. Each Grid is a matrix size INT<0,63> by INT<0,63> filled with\nINT<0,15> values.\n\nYou are playing a game called LockSmith. Rules and strategy:\n* RESET: start over, ACTION1: move up, ACTION2: move down, ACTION3: move left, ACTION4: move right (ACTION5 and ACTION6 do nothing in this game)\n* you may may one action per turn\n* your goal is find and collect a matching key then touch the exit door\n* 6 levels total, score shows which level, complete all levels to win (grid row 62)\n* start each level with limited energy. you GAME_OVER if you run out (grid row 61)\n* the player is a 4x4 square: [[X,X,X,X],[0,0,0,X],[4,4,4,X],[4,4,4,X]] where X is transparent to the background\n* the grid represents a birds-eye view of the level\n* walls are made of INT<10>, you cannot move through a wall\n* walkable floor area is INT<8>\n* you can refill energy by touching energy pills (a 2x2 of INT<6>)\n* current key is shown in bottom-left of entire grid\n* the exit door is a 4x4 square with INT<11> border\n* to find a new key shape, touch the key rotator, a 4x4 square denoted by INT<9> and INT<4> in the top-left corner of the square\n* to find a new key color, touch the color rotator, a 4x4 square denoted by INT<9> and INT<2> and in the bottom-left corner of the square\n* to rotate more than once, move 1 space away from the rotator and back on\n* continue rotating the shape and color of the key until the key matches the one inside the exit door (scaled down 2X)\n* if the grid does not change after an action, you probably tried to move into a wall\n\nAn example of a good strategy observation:\nThe player 4x4 made of INT<4> and INT<0> is standing below a wall of INT<10>, so I cannot move up anymore and should\nmove left towards the rotator with INT<11>.\n\n# TURN:\nCall exactly one action.\n"

One Frame is made of one or more sequential\nGrids. Each Grid is a matrix size INT<0,63> by INT<0,63> filled with\nINT<0,15> values.\n\nYou are playing a game called LockSmith. Rules and strategy:\n* RESET: start over, ACTION1: move up, ACTION2: move down, ACTION3: move left, ACTION4: move right (ACTION5 and ACTION6 do nothing in this game)\n* you may may one action per turn\n* your goal is find and collect a matching key then touch the exit door\n* 6 levels total, score shows which level, complete all levels to win (grid row 62)\n* start each level with limited energy. you GAME_OVER if you run out (grid row 61)\n* the player is a 4x4 square: [[X,X,X,X],[0,0,0,X],[4,4,4,X],[4,4,4,X]] where X is transparent to the background\n* the grid represents a birds-eye view of the level\n* walls are made of INT<10>, you cannot move through a wall\n* walkable floor area is INT<8>\n* you can refill energy by touching energy pills (a 2x2 of INT<6>)\n* current key is shown in bottom-left of entire grid\n* the exit door is a 4x4 square with INT<11> border\n* to find a new key shape, touch the key rotator, a 4x4 square denoted by INT<9> and INT<4> in the top-left corner of the square\n* to find a new key color, touch the color rotator, a 4x4 square denoted by INT<9> and INT<2> and in the bottom-left corner of the square\n* to rotate more than once, move 1 space away from the rotator and back on\n* continue rotating the shape and color of the key until the key matches the one inside the exit door (scaled down 2X)\n* if the grid does not change after an action, you probably tried to move into a wall\n\nAn example of a good strategy observation:\nThe player 4x4 made of INT<4> and INT<0> is standing below a wall of INT<10>, so I cannot move up anymore and should\nmove left towards the rotator with INT<11>.\n\n# TURN:\nCall exactly one action.\n"

One Frame is made of one or more sequential\nGrids. Each Grid is a matrix size INT<0,63> by INT<0,63> filled with\nINT<0,15> values.\n\nYou are playing a game called LockSmith. Rules and strategy:\n* RESET: start over, ACTION1: move up, ACTION2: move down, ACTION3: move left, ACTION4: move right (ACTION5 and ACTION6 do nothing in this game)\n* you may may one action per turn\n* your goal is find and collect a matching key then touch the exit door\n* 6 levels total, score shows which level, complete all levels to win (grid row 62)\n* start each level with limited energy. you GAME_OVER if you run out (grid row 61)\n* the player is a 4x4 square: [[X,X,X,X],[0,0,0,X],[4,4,4,X],[4,4,4,X]] where X is transparent to the background\n* the grid represents a birds-eye view of the level\n* walls are made of INT<10>, you cannot move through a wall\n* walkable floor area is INT<8>\n* you can refill energy by touching energy pills (a 2x2 of INT<6>)\n* current key is shown in bottom-left of entire grid\n* the exit door is a 4x4 square with INT<11> border\n* to find a new key shape, touch the key rotator, a 4x4 square denoted by INT<9> and INT<4> in the top-left corner of the square\n* to find a new key color, touch the color rotator, a 4x4 square denoted by INT<9> and INT<2> and in the bottom-left corner of the square\n* to rotate more than once, move 1 space away from the rotator and back on\n* continue rotating the shape and color of the key until the key matches the one inside the exit door (scaled down 2X)\n* if the grid does not change after an action, you probably tried to move into a wall\n\nAn example of a good strategy observation:\nThe player 4x4 made of INT<4> and INT<0> is standing below a wall of INT<10>, so I cannot move up anymore and should\nmove left towards the rotator with INT<11>.\n\n# TURN:\nCall exactly one action.\n"

One Frame is made of one or more sequential\nGrids. Each Grid is a matrix size INT<0,63> by INT<0,63> filled with\nINT<0,15> values.\n\nYou are playing a game called LockSmith. Rules and strategy:\n* RESET: start over, ACTION1: move up, ACTION2: move down, ACTION3: move left, ACTION4: move right (ACTION5 and ACTION6 do nothing in this game)\n* you may may one action per turn\n* your goal is find and collect a matching key then touch the exit door\n* 6 levels total, score shows which level, complete all levels to win (grid row 62)\n* start each level with limited energy. you GAME_OVER if you run out (grid row 61)\n* the player is a 4x4 square: [[X,X,X,X],[0,0,0,X],[4,4,4,X],[4,4,4,X]] where X is transparent to the background\n* the grid represents a birds-eye view of the level\n* walls are made of INT<10>, you cannot move through a wall\n* walkable floor area is INT<8>\n* you can refill energy by touching energy pills (a 2x2 of INT<6>)\n* current key is shown in bottom-left of entire grid\n* the exit door is a 4x4 square with INT<11> border\n* to find a new key shape, touch the key rotator, a 4x4 square denoted by INT<9> and INT<4> in the top-left corner of the square\n* to find a new key color, touch the color rotator, a 4x4 square denoted by INT<9> and INT<2> and in the bottom-left corner of the square\n* to rotate more than once, move 1 space away from the rotator and back on\n* continue rotating the shape and color of the key until the key matches the one inside the exit door (scaled down 2X)\n* if the grid does not change after an action, you probably tried to move into a wall\n\nAn example of a good strategy observation:\nThe player 4x4 made of INT<4> and INT<0> is standing below a wall of INT<10>, so I cannot move up anymore and should\nmove left towards the rotator with INT<11>.\n\n# TURN:\nCall exactly one action.\n"

One Frame is made of one or more sequential\nGrids. Each Grid is a matrix size INT<0,63> by INT<0,63> filled with\nINT<0,15> values.\n\nYou are playing a game called LockSmith. Rules and strategy:\n* RESET: start over, ACTION1: move up, ACTION2: move down, ACTION3: move left, ACTION4: move right (ACTION5 and ACTION6 do nothing in this game)\n* you may may one action per turn\n* your goal is find and collect a matching key then touch the exit door\n* 6 levels total, score shows which level, complete all levels to win (grid row 62)\n* start each level with limited energy. you GAME_OVER if you run out (grid row 61)\n* the player is a 4x4 square: [[X,X,X,X],[0,0,0,X],[4,4,4,X],[4,4,4,X]] where X is transparent to the background\n* the grid represents a birds-eye view of the level\n* walls are made of INT<10>, you cannot move through a wall\n* walkable floor area is INT<8>\n* you can refill energy by touching energy pills (a 2x2 of INT<6>)\n* current key is shown in bottom-left of entire grid\n* the exit door is a 4x4 square with INT<11> border\n* to find a new key shape, touch the key rotator, a 4x4 square denoted by INT<9> and INT<4> in the top-left corner of the square\n* to find a new key color, touch the color rotator, a 4x4 square denoted by INT<9> and INT<2> and in the bottom-left corner of the square\n* to rotate more than once, move 1 space away from the rotator and back on\n* continue rotating the shape and color of the key until the key matches the one inside the exit door (scaled down 2X)\n* if the grid does not change after an action, you probably tried to move into a wall\n\nAn example of a good strategy observation:\nThe player 4x4 made of INT<4> and INT<0> is standing below a wall of INT<10>, so I cannot move up anymore and should\nmove left towards the rotator with INT<11>.\n\n# TURN:\nCall exactly one action.\n"

One Frame is made of one or more sequential\nGrids. Each Grid is a matrix size INT<0,63> by INT<0,63> filled with\nINT<0,15> values.\n\nYou are playing a game called LockSmith. Rules and strategy:\n* RESET: start over, ACTION1: move up, ACTION2: move down, ACTION3: move left, ACTION4: move right (ACTION5 and ACTION6 do nothing in this game)\n* you may may one action per turn\n* your goal is find and collect a matching key then touch the exit door\n* 6 levels total, score shows which level, complete all levels to win (grid row 62)\n* start each level with limited energy. you GAME_OVER if you run out (grid row 61)\n* the player is a 4x4 square: [[X,X,X,X],[0,0,0,X],[4,4,4,X],[4,4,4,X]] where X is transparent to the background\n* the grid represents a birds-eye view of the level\n* walls are made of INT<10>, you cannot move through a wall\n* walkable floor area is INT<8>\n* you can refill energy by touching energy pills (a 2x2 of INT<6>)\n* current key is shown in bottom-left of entire grid\n* the exit door is a 4x4 square with INT<11> border\n* to find a new key shape, touch the key rotator, a 4x4 square denoted by INT<9> and INT<4> in the top-left corner of the square\n* to find a new key color, touch the color rotator, a 4x4 square denoted by INT<9> and INT<2> and in the bottom-left corner of the square\n* to rotate more than once, move 1 space away from the rotator and back on\n* continue rotating the shape and color of the key until the key matches the one inside the exit door (scaled down 2X)\n* if the grid does not change after an action, you probably tried to move into a wall\n\nAn example of a good strategy observation:\nThe player 4x4 made of INT<4> and INT<0> is standing below a wall of INT<10>, so I cannot move up anymore and should\nmove left towards the rotator with INT<11>.\n\n# TURN:\nCall exactly one action.\n"

One Frame is made of one or more sequential\nGrids. Each Grid is a matrix size INT<0,63> by INT<0,63> filled with\nINT<0,15> values.\n\nYou are playing a game called LockSmith. Rules and strategy:\n* RESET: start over, ACTION1: move up, ACTION2: move down, ACTION3: move left, ACTION4: move right (ACTION5 and ACTION6 do nothing in this game)\n* you may may one action per turn\n* your goal is find and collect a matching key then touch the exit door\n* 6 levels total, score shows which level, complete all levels to win (grid row 62)\n* start each level with limited energy. you GAME_OVER if you run out (grid row 61)\n* the player is a 4x4 square: [[X,X,X,X],[0,0,0,X],[4,4,4,X],[4,4,4,X]] where X is transparent to the background\n* the grid represents a birds-eye view of the level\n* walls are made of INT<10>, you cannot move through a wall\n* walkable floor area is INT<8>\n* you can refill energy by touching energy pills (a 2x2 of INT<6>)\n* current key is shown in bottom-left of entire grid\n* the exit door is a 4x4 square with INT<11> border\n* to find a new key shape, touch the key rotator, a 4x4 square denoted by INT<9> and INT<4> in the top-left corner of the square\n* to find a new key color, touch the color rotator, a 4x4 square denoted by INT<9> and INT<2> and in the bottom-left corner of the square\n* to rotate more than once, move 1 space away from the rotator and back on\n* continue rotating the shape and color of the key until the key matches the one inside the exit door (scaled down 2X)\n* if the grid does not change after an action, you probably tried to move into a wall\n\nAn example of a good strategy observation:\nThe player 4x4 made of INT<4> and INT<0> is standing below a wall of INT<10>, so I cannot move up anymore and should\nmove left towards the rotator with INT<11>.\n\n# TURN:\nCall exactly one action.\n"

One Frame is made of one or more sequential\nGrids. Each Grid is a matrix size INT<0,63> by INT<0,63> filled with\nINT<0,15> values.\n\nYou are playing a game called LockSmith. Rules and strategy:\n* RESET: start over, ACTION1: move up, ACTION2: move down, ACTION3: move left, ACTION4: move right (ACTION5 and ACTION6 do nothing in this game)\n* you may may one action per turn\n* your goal is find and collect a matching key then touch the exit door\n* 6 levels total, score shows which level, complete all levels to win (grid row 62)\n* start each level with limited energy. you GAME_OVER if you run out (grid row 61)\n* the player is a 4x4 square: [[X,X,X,X],[0,0,0,X],[4,4,4,X],[4,4,4,X]] where X is transparent to the background\n* the grid represents a birds-eye view of the level\n* walls are made of INT<10>, you cannot move through a wall\n* walkable floor area is INT<8>\n* you can refill energy by touching energy pills (a 2x2 of INT<6>)\n* current key is shown in bottom-left of entire grid\n* the exit door is a 4x4 square with INT<11> border\n* to find a new key shape, touch the key rotator, a 4x4 square denoted by INT<9> and INT<4> in the top-left corner of the square\n* to find a new key color, touch the color rotator, a 4x4 square denoted by INT<9> and INT<2> and in the bottom-left corner of the square\n* to rotate more than once, move 1 space away from the rotator and back on\n* continue rotating the shape and color of the key until the key matches the one inside the exit door (scaled down 2X)\n* if the grid does not change after an action, you probably tried to move into a wall\n\nAn example of a good strategy observation:\nThe player 4x4 made of INT<4> and INT<0> is standing below a wall of INT<10>, so I cannot move up anymore and should\nmove left towards the rotator with INT<11>.\n\n# TURN:\nCall exactly one action.\n"

Rules and strategy:\n* RESET: start over, ACTION1: move up, ACTION2: move down, ACTION3: move left, ACTION4: move right (ACTION5 and ACTION6 do nothing in this game)\n* you may may one action per turn\n* your goal is find and collect a matching key then touch the exit door\n* 6 levels total, score shows which level, complete all levels to win (grid row 62)\n* start each level with limited energy. you GAME_OVER if you run out (grid row 61)\n* the player is a 4x4 square: [[X,X,X,X],[0,0,0,X],[4,4,4,X],[4,4,4,X]] where X is transparent to the background\n* the grid represents a birds-eye view of the level\n* walls are made of INT<10>, you cannot move through a wall\n* walkable floor area is INT<8>\n* you can refill energy by touching energy pills (a 2x2 of INT<6>)\n* current key is shown in bottom-left of entire grid\n* the exit door is a 4x4 square with INT<11> border\n* to find a new key shape, touch the key rotator, a 4x4 square denoted by INT<9> and INT<4> in the top-left corner of the square\n* to find a new key color, touch the color rotator, a 4x4 square denoted by INT<9> and INT<2> and in the bottom-left corner of the square\n* to rotate more than once, move 1 space away from the rotator and back on\n* continue rotating the shape and color of the key until the key matches the one inside the exit door (scaled down 2X)\n* if the grid does not change after an action, you probably tried to move into a wall\n\nAn example of a good strategy observation:\nThe player 4x4 made of INT<4> and INT<0> is standing below a wall of INT<10>, so I cannot move up anymore and should\nmove left towards the rotator with INT<11>.\n\n# TURN:\nCall exactly one action.\n"

One Frame is made of one or more sequential\nGrids. Each Grid is a matrix size INT<0,63> by INT<0,63> filled with\nINT<0,15> values.\n\nYou are playing a game called LockSmith. Rules and strategy:\n* RESET: start over, ACTION1: move up, ACTION2: move down, ACTION3: move left, ACTION4: move right (ACTION5 and ACTION6 do nothing in this game)\n* you may may one action per turn\n* your goal is find and collect a matching key then touch the exit door\n* 6 levels total, score shows which level, complete all levels to win (grid row 62)\n* start each level with limited energy. you GAME_OVER if you run out (grid row 61)\n* the player is a 4x4 square: [[X,X,X,X],[0,0,0,X],[4,4,4,X],[4,4,4,X]] where X is transparent to the background\n* the grid represents a birds-eye view of the level\n* walls are made of INT<10>, you cannot move through a wall\n* walkable floor area is INT<8>\n* you can refill energy by touching energy pills (a 2x2 of INT<6>)\n* current key is shown in bottom-left of entire grid\n* the exit door is a 4x4 square with INT<11> border\n* to find a new key shape, touch the key rotator, a 4x4 square denoted by INT<9> and INT<4> in the top-left corner of the square\n* to find a new key color, touch the color rotator, a 4x4 square denoted by INT<9> and INT<2> and in the bottom-left corner of the square\n* to rotate more than once, move 1 space away from the rotator and back on\n* continue rotating the shape and color of the key until the key matches the one inside the exit door (scaled down 2X)\n* if the grid does not change after an action, you probably tried to move into a wall\n\nAn example of a good strategy observation:\nThe player 4x4 made of INT<4> and INT<0> is standing below a wall of INT<10>, so I cannot move up anymore and should\nmove left towards the rotator with INT<11>.\n\n# TURN:\nCall exactly one action.\n"

One Frame is made of one or more sequential\nGrids. Each Grid is a matrix size INT<0,63> by INT<0,63> filled with\nINT<0,15> values.\n\nYou are playing a game called LockSmith. Rules and strategy:\n* RESET: start over, ACTION1: move up, ACTION2: move down, ACTION3: move left, ACTION4: move right (ACTION5 and ACTION6 do nothing in this game)\n* you may may one action per turn\n* your goal is find and collect a matching key then touch the exit door\n* 6 levels total, score shows which level, complete all levels to win (grid row 62)\n* start each level with limited energy. you GAME_OVER if you run out (grid row 61)\n* the player is a 4x4 square: [[X,X,X,X],[0,0,0,X],[4,4,4,X],[4,4,4,X]] where X is transparent to the background\n* the grid represents a birds-eye view of the level\n* walls are made of INT<10>, you cannot move through a wall\n* walkable floor area is INT<8>\n* you can refill energy by touching energy pills (a 2x2 of INT<6>)\n* current key is shown in bottom-left of entire grid\n* the exit door is a 4x4 square with INT<11> border\n* to find a new key shape, touch the key rotator, a 4x4 square denoted by INT<9> and INT<4> in the top-left corner of the square\n* to find a new key color, touch the color rotator, a 4x4 square denoted by INT<9> and INT<2> and in the bottom-left corner of the square\n* to rotate more than once, move 1 space away from the rotator and back on\n* continue rotating the shape and color of the key until the key matches the one inside the exit door (scaled down 2X)\n* if the grid does not change after an action, you probably tried to move into a wall\n\nAn example of a good strategy observation:\nThe player 4x4 made of INT<4> and INT<0> is standing below a wall of INT<10>, so I cannot move up anymore and should\nmove left towards the rotator with INT<11>.\n\n# TURN:\nCall exactly one action.\n"

One Frame is made of one or more sequential\nGrids. Each Grid is a matrix size INT<0,63> by INT<0,63> filled with\nINT<0,15> values.\n\nYou are playing a game called LockSmith. Rules and strategy:\n* RESET: start over, ACTION1: move up, ACTION2: move down, ACTION3: move left, ACTION4: move right (ACTION5 and ACTION6 do nothing in this game)\n* you may may one action per turn\n* your goal is find and collect a matching key then touch the exit door\n* 6 levels total, score shows which level, complete all levels to win (grid row 62)\n* start each level with limited energy. you GAME_OVER if you run out (grid row 61)\n* the player is a 4x4 square: [[X,X,X,X],[0,0,0,X],[4,4,4,X],[4,4,4,X]] where X is transparent to the background\n* the grid represents a birds-eye view of the level\n* walls are made of INT<10>, you cannot move through a wall\n* walkable floor area is INT<8>\n* you can refill energy by touching energy pills (a 2x2 of INT<6>)\n* current key is shown in bottom-left of entire grid\n* the exit door is a 4x4 square with INT<11> border\n* to find a new key shape, touch the key rotator, a 4x4 square denoted by INT<9> and INT<4> in the top-left corner of the square\n* to find a new key color, touch the color rotator, a 4x4 square denoted by INT<9> and INT<2> and in the bottom-left corner of the square\n* to rotate more than once, move 1 space away from the rotator and back on\n* continue rotating the shape and color of the key until the key matches the one inside the exit door (scaled down 2X)\n* if the grid does not change after an action, you probably tried to move into a wall\n\nAn example of a good strategy observation:\nThe player 4x4 made of INT<4> and INT<0> is standing below a wall of INT<10>, so I cannot move up anymore and should\nmove left towards the rotator with INT<11>.\n\n# TURN:\nCall exactly one action.\n"

One Frame is made of one or more sequential\nGrids. Each Grid is a matrix size INT<0,63> by INT<0,63> filled with\nINT<0,15> values.\n\nYou are playing a game called LockSmith. Rules and strategy:\n* RESET: start over, ACTION1: move up, ACTION2: move down, ACTION3: move left, ACTION4: move right (ACTION5 and ACTION6 do nothing in this game)\n* you may may one action per turn\n* your goal is find and collect a matching key then touch the exit door\n* 6 levels total, score shows which level, complete all levels to win (grid row 62)\n* start each level with limited energy. you GAME_OVER if you run out (grid row 61)\n* the player is a 4x4 square: [[X,X,X,X],[0,0,0,X],[4,4,4,X],[4,4,4,X]] where X is transparent to the background\n* the grid represents a birds-eye view of the level\n* walls are made of INT<10>, you cannot move through a wall\n* walkable floor area is INT<8>\n* you can refill energy by touching energy pills (a 2x2 of INT<6>)\n* current key is shown in bottom-left of entire grid\n* the exit door is a 4x4 square with INT<11> border\n* to find a new key shape, touch the key rotator, a 4x4 square denoted by INT<9> and INT<4> in the top-left corner of the square\n* to find a new key color, touch the color rotator, a 4x4 square denoted by INT<9> and INT<2> and in the bottom-left corner of the square\n* to rotate more than once, move 1 space away from the rotator and back on\n* continue rotating the shape and color of the key until the key matches the one inside the exit door (scaled down 2X)\n* if the grid does not change after an action, you probably tried to move into a wall\n\nAn example of a good strategy observation:\nThe player 4x4 made of INT<4> and INT<0> is standing below a wall of INT<10>, so I cannot move up anymore and should\nmove left towards the rotator with INT<11>.\n\n# TURN:\nCall exactly one action.\n"

One Frame is made of one or more sequential\nGrids. Each Grid is a matrix size INT<0,63> by INT<0,63> filled with\nINT<0,15> values.\n\nYou are playing a game called LockSmith. Rules and strategy:\n* RESET: start over, ACTION1: move up, ACTION2: move down, ACTION3: move left, ACTION4: move right (ACTION5 and ACTION6 do nothing in this game)\n* you may may one action per turn\n* your goal is find and collect a matching key then touch the exit door\n* 6 levels total, score shows which level, complete all levels to win (grid row 62)\n* start each level with limited energy. you GAME_OVER if you run out (grid row 61)\n* the player is a 4x4 square: [[X,X,X,X],[0,0,0,X],[4,4,4,X],[4,4,4,X]] where X is transparent to the background\n* the grid represents a birds-eye view of the level\n* walls are made of INT<10>, you cannot move through a wall\n* walkable floor area is INT<8>\n* you can refill energy by touching energy pills (a 2x2 of INT<6>)\n* current key is shown in bottom-left of entire grid\n* the exit door is a 4x4 square with INT<11> border\n* to find a new key shape, touch the key rotator, a 4x4 square denoted by INT<9> and INT<4> in the top-left corner of the square\n* to find a new key color, touch the color rotator, a 4x4 square denoted by INT<9> and INT<2> and in the bottom-left corner of the square\n* to rotate more than once, move 1 space away from the rotator and back on\n* continue rotating the shape and color of the key until the key matches the one inside the exit door (scaled down 2X)\n* if the grid does not change after an action, you probably tried to move into a wall\n\nAn example of a good strategy observation:\nThe player 4x4 made of INT<4> and INT<0> is standing below a wall of INT<10>, so I cannot move up anymore and should\nmove left towards the rotator with INT<11>.\n\n# TURN:\nCall exactly one action.\n"

I don’t see any 11-bordered exit or a 2x2 of 6s for energy nearby. There are several 9 clusters elsewhere (mid-map and far left) that could be rotators, but I don’t yet see the required 4-in-top-left or 2-in-bottom-left marker within a 4x4 block from here. Best to continue right along the 0s to uncover the rotator or exit."

One Frame is made of one or more sequential\nGrids. Each Grid is a matrix size INT<0,63> by INT<0,63> filled with\nINT<0,15> values.\n\nYou are playing a game called LockSmith. Rules and strategy:\n* RESET: start over, ACTION1: move up, ACTION2: move down, ACTION3: move left, ACTION4: move right (ACTION5 and ACTION6 do nothing in this game)\n* you may may one action per turn\n* your goal is find and collect a matching key then touch the exit door\n* 6 levels total, score shows which level, complete all levels to win (grid row 62)\n* start each level with limited energy. you GAME_OVER if you run out (grid row 61)\n* the player is a 4x4 square: [[X,X,X,X],[0,0,0,X],[4,4,4,X],[4,4,4,X]] where X is transparent to the background\n* the grid represents a birds-eye view of the level\n* walls are made of INT<10>, you cannot move through a wall\n* walkable floor area is INT<8>\n* you can refill energy by touching energy pills (a 2x2 of INT<6>)\n* current key is shown in bottom-left of entire grid\n* the exit door is a 4x4 square with INT<11> border\n* to find a new key shape, touch the key rotator, a 4x4 square denoted by INT<9> and INT<4> in the top-left corner of the square\n* to find a new key color, touch the color rotator, a 4x4 square denoted by INT<9> and INT<2> and in the bottom-left corner of the square\n* to rotate more than once, move 1 space away from the rotator and back on\n* continue rotating the shape and color of the key until the key matches the one inside the exit door (scaled down 2X)\n* if the grid does not change after an action, you probably tried to move into a wall\n\nAn example of a good strategy observation:\nThe player 4x4 made of INT<4> and INT<0> is standing below a wall of INT<10>, so I cannot move up anymore and should\nmove left towards the rotator with INT<11>.\n\n# TURN:\nCall exactly one action.\n"

One Frame is made of one or more sequential\nGrids. Each Grid is a matrix size INT<0,63> by INT<0,63> filled with\nINT<0,15> values.\n\nYou are playing a game called LockSmith. Rules and strategy:\n* RESET: start over, ACTION1: move up, ACTION2: move down, ACTION3: move left, ACTION4: move right (ACTION5 and ACTION6 do nothing in this game)\n* you may may one action per turn\n* your goal is find and collect a matching key then touch the exit door\n* 6 levels total, score shows which level, complete all levels to win (grid row 62)\n* start each level with limited energy. you GAME_OVER if you run out (grid row 61)\n* the player is a 4x4 square: [[X,X,X,X],[0,0,0,X],[4,4,4,X],[4,4,4,X]] where X is transparent to the background\n* the grid represents a birds-eye view of the level\n* walls are made of INT<10>, you cannot move through a wall\n* walkable floor area is INT<8>\n* you can refill energy by touching energy pills (a 2x2 of INT<6>)\n* current key is shown in bottom-left of entire grid\n* the exit door is a 4x4 square with INT<11> border\n* to find a new key shape, touch the key rotator, a 4x4 square denoted by INT<9> and INT<4> in the top-left corner of the square\n* to find a new key color, touch the color rotator, a 4x4 square denoted by INT<9> and INT<2> and in the bottom-left corner of the square\n* to rotate more than once, move 1 space away from the rotator and back on\n* continue rotating the shape and color of the key until the key matches the one inside the exit door (scaled down 2X)\n* if the grid does not change after an action, you probably tried to move into a wall\n\nAn example of a good strategy observation:\nThe player 4x4 made of INT<4> and INT<0> is standing below a wall of INT<10>, so I cannot move up anymore and should\nmove left towards the rotator with INT<11>.\n\n# TURN:\nCall exactly one action.\n"

I don’t see any 11-bordered exit or a 2x2 of 6s for energy nearby. There are several 9 clusters elsewhere (mid-map and far left) that could be rotators, but I don’t yet see the required 4-in-top-left or 2-in-bottom-left marker within a 4x4 block from here. Best to continue right along the 0s to uncover the rotator or exit."

    "content": "\n# CONTEXT:\nYou are an agent playing a dynamic game. Your objective is to\nWIN and avoid GAME_OVER while minimizing actions.\n\nOne action produces one Frame. One Frame is made of one or more sequential\nGrids. Each Grid is a matrix size INT<0,63> by INT<0,63> filled with\nINT<0,15> values.\n\nYou are playing a game called LockSmith. Rules and strategy:\n* RESET: start over, ACTION1: move up, ACTION2: move down, ACTION3: move left, ACTION4: move right (ACTION5 and ACTION6 do nothing in this game)\n* you may may one action per turn\n* your goal is find and collect a matching key then touch the exit door\n* 6 levels total, score shows which level, complete all levels to win (grid row 62)\n* start each level with limited energy. you GAME_OVER if you run out (grid row 61)\n* the player is a 4x4 square: [[X,X,X,X],[0,0,0,X],[4,4,4,X],[4,4,4,X]] where X is transparent to the background\n* the grid represents a birds-eye view of the level\n* walls are made of INT<10>, you cannot move through a wall\n* walkable floor area is INT<8>\n* you can refill energy by touching energy pills (a 2x2 of INT<6>)\n* current key is shown in bottom-left of entire grid\n* the exit door is a 4x4 square with INT<11> border\n* to find a new key shape, touch the key rotator, a 4x4 square denoted by INT<9> and INT<4> in the top-left corner of the square\n* to find a new key color, touch the color rotator, a 4x4 square denoted by INT<9> and INT<2> and in the bottom-left corner of the square\n* to rotate more than once, move 1 space away from the rotator and back on\n* continue rotating the shape and color of the key until the key matches the one inside the exit door (scaled down 2X)\n* if the grid does not change after an action, you probably tried to move into a wall\n\nAn example of a good strategy observation:\nThe player 4x4 made of INT<4> and INT<0> is standing below a wall of INT<10>, so I cannot move up anymore and should\nmove left towards the rotator with INT<11>.\n\n# TURN:\nCall exactly one action.\n"

One Frame is made of one or more sequential\nGrids. Each Grid is a matrix size INT<0,63> by INT<0,63> filled with\nINT<0,15> values.\n\nYou are playing a game called LockSmith. Rules and strategy:\n* RESET: start over, ACTION1: move up, ACTION2: move down, ACTION3: move left, ACTION4: move right (ACTION5 and ACTION6 do nothing in this game)\n* you may may one action per turn\n* your goal is find and collect a matching key then touch the exit door\n* 6 levels total, score shows which level, complete all levels to win (grid row 62)\n* start each level with limited energy. you GAME_OVER if you run out (grid row 61)\n* the player is a 4x4 square: [[X,X,X,X],[0,0,0,X],[4,4,4,X],[4,4,4,X]] where X is transparent to the background\n* the grid represents a birds-eye view of the level\n* walls are made of INT<10>, you cannot move through a wall\n* walkable floor area is INT<8>\n* you can refill energy by touching energy pills (a 2x2 of INT<6>)\n* current key is shown in bottom-left of entire grid\n* the exit door is a 4x4 square with INT<11> border\n* to find a new key shape, touch the key rotator, a 4x4 square denoted by INT<9> and INT<4> in the top-left corner of the square\n* to find a new key color, touch the color rotator, a 4x4 square denoted by INT<9> and INT<2> and in the bottom-left corner of the square\n* to rotate more than once, move 1 space away from the rotator and back on\n* continue rotating the shape and color of the key until the key matches the one inside the exit door (scaled down 2X)\n* if the grid does not change after an action, you probably tried to move into a wall\n\nAn example of a good strategy observation:\nThe player 4x4 made of INT<4> and INT<0> is standing below a wall of INT<10>, so I cannot move up anymore and should\nmove left towards the rotator with INT<11>.\n\n# TURN:\nCall exactly one action.\n"

One Frame is made of one or more sequential\nGrids. Each Grid is a matrix size INT<0,63> by INT<0,63> filled with\nINT<0,15> values.\n\nYou are playing a game called LockSmith. Rules and strategy:\n* RESET: start over, ACTION1: move up, ACTION2: move down, ACTION3: move left, ACTION4: move right (ACTION5 and ACTION6 do nothing in this game)\n* you may may one action per turn\n* your goal is find and collect a matching key then touch the exit door\n* 6 levels total, score shows which level, complete all levels to win (grid row 62)\n* start each level with limited energy. you GAME_OVER if you run out (grid row 61)\n* the player is a 4x4 square: [[X,X,X,X],[0,0,0,X],[4,4,4,X],[4,4,4,X]] where X is transparent to the background\n* the grid represents a birds-eye view of the level\n* walls are made of INT<10>, you cannot move through a wall\n* walkable floor area is INT<8>\n* you can refill energy by touching energy pills (a 2x2 of INT<6>)\n* current key is shown in bottom-left of entire grid\n* the exit door is a 4x4 square with INT<11> border\n* to find a new key shape, touch the key rotator, a 4x4 square denoted by INT<9> and INT<4> in the top-left corner of the square\n* to find a new key color, touch the color rotator, a 4x4 square denoted by INT<9> and INT<2> and in the bottom-left corner of the square\n* to rotate more than once, move 1 space away from the rotator and back on\n* continue rotating the shape and color of the key until the key matches the one inside the exit door (scaled down 2X)\n* if the grid does not change after an action, you probably tried to move into a wall\n\nAn example of a good strategy observation:\nThe player 4x4 made of INT<4> and INT<0> is standing below a wall of INT<10>, so I cannot move up anymore and should\nmove left towards the rotator with INT<11>.\n\n# TURN:\nCall exactly one action.\n"

One Frame is made of one or more sequential\nGrids. Each Grid is a matrix size INT<0,63> by INT<0,63> filled with\nINT<0,15> values.\n\nYou are playing a game called LockSmith. Rules and strategy:\n* RESET: start over, ACTION1: move up, ACTION2: move down, ACTION3: move left, ACTION4: move right (ACTION5 and ACTION6 do nothing in this game)\n* you may may one action per turn\n* your goal is find and collect a matching key then touch the exit door\n* 6 levels total, score shows which level, complete all levels to win (grid row 62)\n* start each level with limited energy. you GAME_OVER if you run out (grid row 61)\n* the player is a 4x4 square: [[X,X,X,X],[0,0,0,X],[4,4,4,X],[4,4,4,X]] where X is transparent to the background\n* the grid represents a birds-eye view of the level\n* walls are made of INT<10>, you cannot move through a wall\n* walkable floor area is INT<8>\n* you can refill energy by touching energy pills (a 2x2 of INT<6>)\n* current key is shown in bottom-left of entire grid\n* the exit door is a 4x4 square with INT<11> border\n* to find a new key shape, touch the key rotator, a 4x4 square denoted by INT<9> and INT<4> in the top-left corner of the square\n* to find a new key color, touch the color rotator, a 4x4 square denoted by INT<9> and INT<2> and in the bottom-left corner of the square\n* to rotate more than once, move 1 space away from the rotator and back on\n* continue rotating the shape and color of the key until the key matches the one inside the exit door (scaled down 2X)\n* if the grid does not change after an action, you probably tried to move into a wall\n\nAn example of a good strategy observation:\nThe player 4x4 made of INT<4> and INT<0> is standing below a wall of INT<10>, so I cannot move up anymore and should\nmove left towards the rotator with INT<11>.\n\n# TURN:\nCall exactly one action.\n"

One Frame is made of one or more sequential\nGrids. Each Grid is a matrix size INT<0,63> by INT<0,63> filled with\nINT<0,15> values.\n\nYou are playing a game called LockSmith. Rules and strategy:\n* RESET: start over, ACTION1: move up, ACTION2: move down, ACTION3: move left, ACTION4: move right (ACTION5 and ACTION6 do nothing in this game)\n* you may may one action per turn\n* your goal is find and collect a matching key then touch the exit door\n* 6 levels total, score shows which level, complete all levels to win (grid row 62)\n* start each level with limited energy. you GAME_OVER if you run out (grid row 61)\n* the player is a 4x4 square: [[X,X,X,X],[0,0,0,X],[4,4,4,X],[4,4,4,X]] where X is transparent to the background\n* the grid represents a birds-eye view of the level\n* walls are made of INT<10>, you cannot move through a wall\n* walkable floor area is INT<8>\n* you can refill energy by touching energy pills (a 2x2 of INT<6>)\n* current key is shown in bottom-left of entire grid\n* the exit door is a 4x4 square with INT<11> border\n* to find a new key shape, touch the key rotator, a 4x4 square denoted by INT<9> and INT<4> in the top-left corner of the square\n* to find a new key color, touch the color rotator, a 4x4 square denoted by INT<9> and INT<2> and in the bottom-left corner of the square\n* to rotate more than once, move 1 space away from the rotator and back on\n* continue rotating the shape and color of the key until the key matches the one inside the exit door (scaled down 2X)\n* if the grid does not change after an action, you probably tried to move into a wall\n\nAn example of a good strategy observation:\nThe player 4x4 made of INT<4> and INT<0> is standing below a wall of INT<10>, so I cannot move up anymore and should\nmove left towards the rotator with INT<11>.\n\n# TURN:\nCall exactly one action.\n"

One Frame is made of one or more sequential\nGrids. Each Grid is a matrix size INT<0,63> by INT<0,63> filled with\nINT<0,15> values.\n\nYou are playing a game called LockSmith. Rules and strategy:\n* RESET: start over, ACTION1: move up, ACTION2: move down, ACTION3: move left, ACTION4: move right (ACTION5 and ACTION6 do nothing in this game)\n* you may may one action per turn\n* your goal is find and collect a matching key then touch the exit door\n* 6 levels total, score shows which level, complete all levels to win (grid row 62)\n* start each level with limited energy. you GAME_OVER if you run out (grid row 61)\n* the player is a 4x4 square: [[X,X,X,X],[0,0,0,X],[4,4,4,X],[4,4,4,X]] where X is transparent to the background\n* the grid represents a birds-eye view of the level\n* walls are made of INT<10>, you cannot move through a wall\n* walkable floor area is INT<8>\n* you can refill energy by touching energy pills (a 2x2 of INT<6>)\n* current key is shown in bottom-left of entire grid\n* the exit door is a 4x4 square with INT<11> border\n* to find a new key shape, touch the key rotator, a 4x4 square denoted by INT<9> and INT<4> in the top-left corner of the square\n* to find a new key color, touch the color rotator, a 4x4 square denoted by INT<9> and INT<2> and in the bottom-left corner of the square\n* to rotate more than once, move 1 space away from the rotator and back on\n* continue rotating the shape and color of the key until the key matches the one inside the exit door (scaled down 2X)\n* if the grid does not change after an action, you probably tried to move into a wall\n\nAn example of a good strategy observation:\nThe player 4x4 made of INT<4> and INT<0> is standing below a wall of INT<10>, so I cannot move up anymore and should\nmove left towards the rotator with INT<11>.\n\n# TURN:\nCall exactly one action.\n"
