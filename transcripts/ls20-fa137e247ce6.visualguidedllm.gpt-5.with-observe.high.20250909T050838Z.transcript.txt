It only shows your CURRENT selected key.\n* EXIT (the lock to open):\n  - Elsewhere on the map, the lock is the target white/blue pattern you must match, adjacent to some pure black tiles (they need not fully surround it).\n  - You may leave the level only when your current key EXACTLY matches this lock’s white/blue distribution.\n* KEY GENERATOR (interactive, how to generate keys):\n  - Look for a patch consisting of white and blue that has a CLEAR path of light gray leading to it and around it, and is NOT bordered by pure black or boxed by dark gray.\n  - When any part of your 8×8 player steps ONTO this patch, it GENERATES a NEW candidate key and updates the bottom-left indicator (boxed by dark gray).\n  - Step OFF the patch and then back ON to generate yet another candidate key; repeat to cycle through the set of keys.\n  - Continue cycling until the bottom-left indicator EXACTLY matches the lock pattern at the exit (the same white/blue layout adjacent to pure black).\n* Locating things quickly:\n  - Generator: a white/blue patch accessible via light gray, with only light gray around it (no pure black), is almost certainly the generator.\n  - Exit: a matching white/blue pattern near pure black tiles marks the lock/exit area.\n\n# HUD / PROGRESSION\n* Visual score on the second-to-last grid row: it contains several 4-tile “slots.”\n  - Slots made of light gray represent UNFINISHED levels.\n  - When a slot changes from light gray to another color, that level is COMPLETE.\n* Track remaining MOVES/ENERGY by counting purple tiles.\n* Track LIVES by counting distinct 2×2 blocks of red.\n\n# GENERAL NOTES\n* The grid is a bird’s-eye view.\n* If the grid does not change after an action, you likely attempted an illegal move into dark gray.\n* Favor routes marked by light gray; use the generator (white/blue patch surrounded by light gray) to cycle keys; confirm the match by comparing the bottom-left indicator (boxed by dark gray) to the white/blue lock pattern found near pure black; then proceed to the exit.\n\n# EXAMPLE STRATEGY OBSERVATION\nThe 8×8 player (top rows orange, bottom rows blue) is touching dark gray on the left, so LEFT is blocked.
