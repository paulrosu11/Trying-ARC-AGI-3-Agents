One Frame is made of one or more sequential\nGrids. Each Grid is a matrix size INT<0,63> by INT<0,63> filled with\ncolored tiles. Each color represents a different object or rule.\n\nYou are playing a game called LockSmith.\n\n# CONTROLS\n* RESET: start over\n* ACTION1: move up\n* ACTION2: move down\n* ACTION3: move left\n* ACTION4: move right\n* ACTION5/ACTION6: no-ops\n\n# ORIENTATION (read carefully)\n* The global frame is fixed: the bottom-left KEY INDICATOR is always at the bottom-left; the EXIT/lock is elsewhere.\n* ACTION1 (UP) moves you toward the area where purple tiles (move counters) are located; use this as a compass for “up.”\n* ACTION4 (RIGHT) increases your distance from the bottom-left key indicator; ACTION3 (LEFT) decreases it.\n* Legality checks with dark gray walls:\n  - RIGHT is ILLEGAL if any dark gray tiles lie immediately to the right (“after” in row order) of any orange/blue cells of your 8×8 player.\n  - LEFT is ILLEGAL if any dark gray tiles lie immediately to the left (“before” in row order) of any orange/blue cells of your 8×8 player.\n  - UP is ILLEGAL if any dark gray tiles lie directly above the topmost orange row of your player.\n  - DOWN is ILLEGAL if any dark gray tiles lie directly below the bottommost blue row of your player.\n* Always orient carefully before moving: check where the purple tiles lie (for UP), how far you are from the bottom-left indicator (for LEFT/RIGHT), and whether dark gray walls precede/follow your orange/blue rows in the intended direction.\n\n# GOAL\nFind/generate a key that MATCHES the key pattern shown at the EXIT, then navigate to the EXIT to finish the level.\nThere are 6 levels total. Complete all levels to WIN.\n\n# TILE MEANINGS (important ones)\n* white = key pattern cells\n* light gray = walkable path / corridor marker (often outlines routes to key/exit)\n* dark gray = WALL (solid). You cannot enter dark gray.\n* pure black = EXIT indicator (presence of pure black tiles marks/frames the exit area)\n* red = LIFE token (count lives as the number of 2×2 blocks of red)\n* blue = player lower-body color and also used in key patterns\n* orange = player upper-body color\n* purple = MOVE/energy counter (number of purple tiles ≈ moves/energy left)\n\n# PLAYER (sprite + movement legality)\n* The player is an 8×8 sprite: the top two rows are all orange; the bottom six rows are all blue.\n  - Other scattered blue tiles on the board are NOT the player—only the exact 8×8 (2×8 of orange stacked on 6×8 of blue) is the player.\n* Movement rules:\n  - You may move only through non–dark gray tiles (i.e., never overlap a dark gray wall after a move).\n  - If any part of your 8×8 sprite would overlap dark gray in the target direction (including cases where dark gray lies “under” blue), that move is ILLEGAL.\n  - If your sprite is already touching dark gray on a side, you cannot move further in that touching direction until you have clearance.\n  - Practically: navigate corridors “between the dark gray walls.”\n\n# KEYS, EXIT, AND HOW TO FIND THEM\n* Bottom-left KEY INDICATOR (non-interactive):\n  - A small block of white and blue COMPLETELY BOXED by dark gray in the bottom-left of the entire grid.\n  - This is NOT reachable and NOT a gameplay area. It only shows your CURRENT selected key.\n* EXIT (the lock to open):\n  - Elsewhere on the map, the lock is the target white/blue pattern you must match, adjacent to some pure black tiles (they need not fully surround it).\n  - You may leave the level only when your current key EXACTLY matches this lock’s white/blue distribution.\n* KEY GENERATOR (interactive, how to generate keys):\n  - Look for a patch consisting of white and blue that has a CLEAR path of light gray leading to it and around it, and is NOT bordered by pure black or boxed by dark gray.\n  - When any part of your 8×8 player steps ONTO this patch, it GENERATES a NEW candidate key and updates the bottom-left indicator (boxed by dark gray).\n  - Step OFF the patch and then back ON to generate yet another candidate key; repeat to cycle through the set of keys.\n  - Continue cycling until the bottom-left indicator EXACTLY matches the lock pattern at the exit (the same white/blue layout adjacent to pure black).\n* Locating things quickly:\n  - Generator: a white/blue patch accessible via light gray, with only light gray around it (no pure black), is almost certainly the generator.\n  - Exit: a matching white/blue pattern near pure black tiles marks the lock/exit area.\n\n# HUD / PROGRESSION\n* Visual score on the second-to-last grid row: it contains several 4-tile “slots.”\n  - Slots made of light gray represent UNFINISHED levels.\n  - When a slot changes from light gray to another color, that level is COMPLETE.\n* Track remaining MOVES/ENERGY by counting purple tiles.\n* Track LIVES by counting distinct 2×2 blocks of red.\n\n# GENERAL NOTES\n* The grid is a bird’s-eye view.\n* If the grid does not change after an action, you likely attempted an illegal move into dark gray.\n* Favor routes marked by light gray; use the generator (white/blue patch surrounded by light gray) to cycle keys; confirm the match by comparing the bottom-left indicator (boxed by dark gray) to the white/blue lock pattern found near pure black; then proceed to the exit.\n\n# EXAMPLE STRATEGY OBSERVATION\nThe 8×8 player (top rows orange, bottom rows blue) is touching dark gray on the left, so LEFT is blocked. I see a white/blue patch with only light gray around it to the right—that’s likely the generator. I should move RIGHT to step on/off it until the bottom-left indicator (boxed by dark gray) matches the lock pattern I see near the pure black tiles, then head to the exit.\n\n# INSTRUCTIONS FOR THIS TURN\nLook at the attached image of the current grid state.

One Frame is made of one or more sequential\nGrids. Each Grid is a matrix size INT<0,63> by INT<0,63> filled with\ncolored tiles. Each color represents a different object or rule.\n\nYou are playing a game called LockSmith.\n\n# CONTROLS\n* RESET: start over\n* ACTION1: move up\n* ACTION2: move down\n* ACTION3: move left\n* ACTION4: move right\n* ACTION5/ACTION6: no-ops\n\n# ORIENTATION (read carefully)\n* The global frame is fixed: the bottom-left KEY INDICATOR is always at the bottom-left; the EXIT/lock is elsewhere.\n* ACTION1 (UP) moves you toward the area where purple tiles (move counters) are located; use this as a compass for “up.”\n* ACTION4 (RIGHT) increases your distance from the bottom-left key indicator; ACTION3 (LEFT) decreases it.\n* Legality checks with dark gray walls:\n  - RIGHT is ILLEGAL if any dark gray tiles lie immediately to the right (“after” in row order) of any orange/blue cells of your 8×8 player.\n  - LEFT is ILLEGAL if any dark gray tiles lie immediately to the left (“before” in row order) of any orange/blue cells of your 8×8 player.\n  - UP is ILLEGAL if any dark gray tiles lie directly above the topmost orange row of your player.\n  - DOWN is ILLEGAL if any dark gray tiles lie directly below the bottommost blue row of your player.\n* Always orient carefully before moving: check where the purple tiles lie (for UP), how far you are from the bottom-left indicator (for LEFT/RIGHT), and whether dark gray walls precede/follow your orange/blue rows in the intended direction.\n\n# GOAL\nFind/generate a key that MATCHES the key pattern shown at the EXIT, then navigate to the EXIT to finish the level.\nThere are 6 levels total. Complete all levels to WIN.\n\n# TILE MEANINGS (important ones)\n* white = key pattern cells\n* light gray = walkable path / corridor marker (often outlines routes to key/exit)\n* dark gray = WALL (solid). You cannot enter dark gray.\n* pure black = EXIT indicator (presence of pure black tiles marks/frames the exit area)\n* red = LIFE token (count lives as the number of 2×2 blocks of red)\n* blue = player lower-body color and also used in key patterns\n* orange = player upper-body color\n* purple = MOVE/energy counter (number of purple tiles ≈ moves/energy left)\n\n# PLAYER (sprite + movement legality)\n* The player is an 8×8 sprite: the top two rows are all orange; the bottom six rows are all blue.\n  - Other scattered blue tiles on the board are NOT the player—only the exact 8×8 (2×8 of orange stacked on 6×8 of blue) is the player.\n* Movement rules:\n  - You may move only through non–dark gray tiles (i.e., never overlap a dark gray wall after a move).\n  - If any part of your 8×8 sprite would overlap dark gray in the target direction (including cases where dark gray lies “under” blue), that move is ILLEGAL.\n  - If your sprite is already touching dark gray on a side, you cannot move further in that touching direction until you have clearance.\n  - Practically: navigate corridors “between the dark gray walls.”\n\n# KEYS, EXIT, AND HOW TO FIND THEM\n* Bottom-left KEY INDICATOR (non-interactive):\n  - A small block of white and blue COMPLETELY BOXED by dark gray in the bottom-left of the entire grid.\n  - This is NOT reachable and NOT a gameplay area. It only shows your CURRENT selected key.\n* EXIT (the lock to open):\n  - Elsewhere on the map, the lock is the target white/blue pattern you must match, adjacent to some pure black tiles (they need not fully surround it).\n  - You may leave the level only when your current key EXACTLY matches this lock’s white/blue distribution.\n* KEY GENERATOR (interactive, how to generate keys):\n  - Look for a patch consisting of white and blue that has a CLEAR path of light gray leading to it and around it, and is NOT bordered by pure black or boxed by dark gray.\n  - When any part of your 8×8 player steps ONTO this patch, it GENERATES a NEW candidate key and updates the bottom-left indicator (boxed by dark gray).\n  - Step OFF the patch and then back ON to generate yet another candidate key; repeat to cycle through the set of keys.\n  - Continue cycling until the bottom-left indicator EXACTLY matches the lock pattern at the exit (the same white/blue layout adjacent to pure black).\n* Locating things quickly:\n  - Generator: a white/blue patch accessible via light gray, with only light gray around it (no pure black), is almost certainly the generator.\n  - Exit: a matching white/blue pattern near pure black tiles marks the lock/exit area.\n\n# HUD / PROGRESSION\n* Visual score on the second-to-last grid row: it contains several 4-tile “slots.”\n  - Slots made of light gray represent UNFINISHED levels.\n  - When a slot changes from light gray to another color, that level is COMPLETE.\n* Track remaining MOVES/ENERGY by counting purple tiles.\n* Track LIVES by counting distinct 2×2 blocks of red.\n\n# GENERAL NOTES\n* The grid is a bird’s-eye view.\n* If the grid does not change after an action, you likely attempted an illegal move into dark gray.\n* Favor routes marked by light gray; use the generator (white/blue patch surrounded by light gray) to cycle keys; confirm the match by comparing the bottom-left indicator (boxed by dark gray) to the white/blue lock pattern found near pure black; then proceed to the exit.\n\n# EXAMPLE STRATEGY OBSERVATION\nThe 8×8 player (top rows orange, bottom rows blue) is touching dark gray on the left, so LEFT is blocked. I see a white/blue patch with only light gray around it to the right—that’s likely the generator. I should move RIGHT to step on/off it until the bottom-left indicator (boxed by dark gray) matches the lock pattern I see near the pure black tiles, then head to the exit.\n\n# INSTRUCTIONS FOR THIS TURN\nLook at the attached image of the current grid state. Decide on the best move that obeys the rules above.\n\n# TURN:\nCall exactly one action, **after thinking deeply**\n\n"
