One Frame is made of one or more sequential\nGrids. Each Grid is a matrix size INT<0,63> by INT<0,63> filled with\ncolored tiles. Each color represents a different object or rule.\n\nYou are playing a game called LockSmith.\n\n# CONTROLS\n* RESET: start over\n* ACTION1: move up\n* ACTION2: move down\n* ACTION3: move left\n* ACTION4: move right\n* ACTION5/ACTION6: no-ops\n\n# ORIENTATION (read carefully)\n* The global frame is fixed: the bottom-left KEY INDICATOR is always at the bottom-left; the EXIT/lock is elsewhere.\n* ACTION1 (UP) moves you toward the area where purple tiles (move counters) are located; use this as a compass for “up.”\n* ACTION4 (RIGHT) increases your distance from the bottom-left key indicator; ACTION3 (LEFT) decreases it.\n* Legality checks with dark gray walls:\n  - RIGHT is ILLEGAL if any dark gray tiles lie immediately to the right of any orange/blue cells of your 8×8 player.\n  - LEFT is ILLEGAL if any dark gray tiles lie immediately to the left of any orange/blue cells of your 8×8 player.\n  - UP is ILLEGAL if any dark gray tiles lie directly above the topmost orange row of your player.\n  - DOWN is ILLEGAL if any dark gray tiles lie directly below the bottommost blue row of your player.\n* Always orient carefully before moving.\n\n# GOAL\nFind/generate a key that MATCHES the key pattern shown at the EXIT, then navigate to the EXIT to finish the level.\nThere are 6 levels total. Complete all levels to WIN.\n\n# TILE MEANINGS (important ones)\n* white = key pattern cells\n* light gray = walkable path / corridors\n* dark gray = WALL (solid)\n* pure black = EXIT indicator\n* red = LIFE token (2×2 blocks)\n* blue = player lower-body & key patterns\n* orange = player upper-body\n* purple = MOVE/energy counter\n\n# PLAYER\n* The player is an 8×8 sprite: top two rows orange; bottom six rows blue.\n* Move only through non–dark gray tiles.\n\n# KEYS / EXIT\n* Bottom-left KEY INDICATOR shows your current key (white/blue) boxed by dark gray; non-interactive.\n* EXIT = matching white/blue pattern near pure black tiles.\n* KEY GENERATOR = white/blue patch reachable via light gray; stepping on it cycles candidate keys.\n\n# HUD\n* Track moves by counting purple tiles; track lives by 2×2 red blocks.\n\n# EXAMPLE STRATEGY OBSERVATION\nThe player (orange over blue) touches dark gray on the left, so LEFT is blocked. I see a white/blue patch with light gray around it to the right—likely the generator. Move RIGHT, cycle until the bottom-left indicator matches the exit’s white/blue, then head to the exit.\n\n# INSTRUCTIONS FOR THIS TURN\nLook at the attached image(s) of the grid state and decide the best legal move.\n\n# TURN:\nCall exactly one action."
