One Frame is made of one or more sequential\nGrids. Each Grid is a matrix size INT<0,63> by INT<0,63> filled with\nINT<0,15> values. Each value represents a different color and usually implies a different object.\n\nYou are playing a game called LockSmith.\n\n# CONTROLS\n* RESET: start over\n* ACTION1: move up\n* ACTION2: move down\n* ACTION3: move left\n* ACTION4: move right\n* ACTION5/ACTION6: no-ops\n\n# ORIENTATION (read carefully)\n* The global frame is fixed: the bottom-left KEY INDICATOR is always at the bottom-left; the EXIT/lock is elsewhere.\n* ACTION1 (UP) moves you toward the area where 15s (move counters) are located; use this as a compass for “up.”\n* ACTION4 (RIGHT) increases your distance from the bottom-left key indicator; ACTION3 (LEFT) decreases it.\n* Legality checks with 4s (walls):\n  - RIGHT is ILLEGAL if any 4s lie immediately to the right (“after” in row order) of any 12/9 cells of your 8×8 player.\n  - LEFT is ILLEGAL if any 4s lie immediately to the left (“before” in row order) of any 12/9 cells of your 8×8 player.\n  - UP is ILLEGAL if any 4s lie directly above the topmost 12 row of your player.\n  - DOWN is ILLEGAL if any 4s lie directly below the bottommost 9 row of your player.\n* Always orient carefully before moving: check where the 15s lie (for UP), how far you are from the bottom-left indicator (for LEFT/RIGHT), and whether 4s precede/follow your 12s/9s in the intended direction.\n\n# GOAL\nFind/generate a key that MATCHES the key pattern shown at the EXIT, then navigate to the EXIT to finish the level.\nThere are 6 levels total. Complete all levels to WIN.\n\n# TILE MEANINGS (important ones)\n* 0 = white cell (used in key patterns)\n* 3 = walkable path / corridor marker (often outlines routes to key/exit)\n* 4 = WALL (solid). You cannot enter 4s.\n* 5 = EXIT indicator (presence of 5s marks/frames the exit area)\n* 8 = LIFE token (count lives as the number of 2×2 blocks of 8s)\n* 9 = blue cells (used in player lower body; also appear elsewhere in the map and in key logic)\n* 12 = orange cells (used in player upper body)\n* 15 = MOVE counter (number of 15s ≈ moves/energy left)\n\n# PLAYER (sprite + movement legality)\n* The player is an 8×8 sprite made ONLY of 12s (top two rows) over 9s (bottom six rows).\n  - Concretely: rows 0–1 (relative to the sprite) are all 12s; rows 2–7 are all 9s.\n  - Other scattered 9s on the board are NOT the player—only the exact 8×8 (2×8 of 12s stacked on 6×8 of 9s) is the player.\n* Movement rules:\n  - You may move only through non-4 cells (i.e., never overlap a 4 after a move).\n  - If any part of your 8×8 sprite would overlap a 4 in the target direction (including cases where 4s lie “under” 9s), that move is ILLEGAL.\n  - If your sprite is already touching 4s on a side, you cannot move further in that touching direction until you have clearance.\n  - Practically: navigate corridors “between the 4s”.\n\n# KEYS, EXIT, AND HOW TO FIND THEM\n* Bottom-left KEY INDICATOR (non-interactive):\n  - A small block of 0s and 9s COMPLETELY BOXED by 4s in the bottom-left of the entire grid.\n  - This is NOT reachable and NOT a gameplay area. It only shows your CURRENT selected key.\n* EXIT (the lock to open):\n  - Elsewhere on the map, the lock is the target 0/9 pattern you must match, adjacent to some 5s (the 5s need not fully surround it).\n  - You may leave the level only when your current key EXACTLY matches this lock’s 0/9 distribution.\n* KEY GENERATOR (interactive, how to generate keys):\n  - Look for a patch consisting of 0s and 9s that has a CLEAR path of 3s leading to it and around it, and is NOT bordered by 5s or boxed by 4s.\n  - When any part of your 8×8 player steps ONTO this patch, it GENERATES a NEW candidate key and updates the bottom-left indicator.\n  - Step OFF the patch and then back ON to generate yet another candidate key; repeat to cycle through the set of keys.\n  - Continue cycling until the bottom-left indicator EXACTLY matches the lock pattern at the exit (the same 0/9 layout adjacent to 5s).\n* Locating things quickly:\n  - Generator: 0/9 patch accessible via 3s, with only 3s around it (no 5s), is almost certainly the generator.\n  - Exit: a matching 0/9 pattern near 5s marks the lock/exit area.\n\n# HUD / PROGRESSION\n* Visual score on the second-to-last grid row (row 62): it contains several 4-cell “slots”.\n  - Slots made of 3s represent UNFINISHED levels.\n  - When a slot changes from 3s to another color, that level is COMPLETE.\n* Track remaining MOVES/ENERGY by counting tiles with value 15.\n* Track LIVES by counting distinct 2×2 blocks of 8s.\n\n# GENERAL NOTES\n* The grid is a bird’s-eye view.\n* If the grid does not change after an action, you likely attempted an illegal move into 4s.\n* Favor routes marked by 3s; use the generator (0/9 patch surrounded by 3s) to cycle keys; confirm the match by comparing the bottom-left indicator (boxed by 4s) to the 0/9 lock pattern found near 5s; then proceed to the exit.\n\n# EXAMPLE STRATEGY OBSERVATION\nThe 8×8 player (top rows 12s, bottom rows 9s) is touching 4s on the left, so LEFT is blocked. I see a 0/9 patch with only 3s around it to the right—that’s likely the generator. I should move RIGHT to step on/off it until the bottom-left indicator (boxed by 4s) matches the lock pattern I see near the 5s, then head to the exit.\n\n# TURN:\nCall exactly one action.\n\n"

    "content": "\n# CONTEXT:\nYou are an agent playing a dynamic game. Your objective is to\nWIN and avoid GAME_OVER while minimizing actions.\n\nOne action produces one Frame. One Frame is made of one or more sequential\nGrids. Each Grid is a matrix size INT<0,63> by INT<0,63> filled with\nINT<0,15> values. Each value represents a different color and usually implies a different object.\n\nYou are playing a game called LockSmith.\n\n# CONTROLS\n* RESET: start over\n* ACTION1: move up\n* ACTION2: move down\n* ACTION3: move left\n* ACTION4: move right\n* ACTION5/ACTION6: no-ops\n\n# ORIENTATION (read carefully)\n* The global frame is fixed: the bottom-left KEY INDICATOR is always at the bottom-left; the EXIT/lock is elsewhere.\n* ACTION1 (UP) moves you toward the area where 15s (move counters) are located; use this as a compass for “up.”\n* ACTION4 (RIGHT) increases your distance from the bottom-left key indicator; ACTION3 (LEFT) decreases it.\n* Legality checks with 4s (walls):\n  - RIGHT is ILLEGAL if any 4s lie immediately to the right (“after” in row order) of any 12/9 cells of your 8×8 player.\n  - LEFT is ILLEGAL if any 4s lie immediately to the left (“before” in row order) of any 12/9 cells of your 8×8 player.\n  - UP is ILLEGAL if any 4s lie directly above the topmost 12 row of your player.\n  - DOWN is ILLEGAL if any 4s lie directly below the bottommost 9 row of your player.\n* Always orient carefully before moving: check where the 15s lie (for UP), how far you are from the bottom-left indicator (for LEFT/RIGHT), and whether 4s precede/follow your 12s/9s in the intended direction.\n\n# GOAL\nFind/generate a key that MATCHES the key pattern shown at the EXIT, then navigate to the EXIT to finish the level.\nThere are 6 levels total. Complete all levels to WIN.\n\n# TILE MEANINGS (important ones)\n* 0 = white cell (used in key patterns)\n* 3 = walkable path / corridor marker (often outlines routes to key/exit)\n* 4 = WALL (solid). You cannot enter 4s.\n* 5 = EXIT indicator (presence of 5s marks/frames the exit area)\n* 8 = LIFE token (count lives as the number of 2×2 blocks of 8s)\n* 9 = blue cells (used in player lower body; also appear elsewhere in the map and in key logic)\n* 12 = orange cells (used in player upper body)\n* 15 = MOVE counter (number of 15s ≈ moves/energy left)\n\n# PLAYER (sprite + movement legality)\n* The player is an 8×8 sprite made ONLY of 12s (top two rows) over 9s (bottom six rows).\n  - Concretely: rows 0–1 (relative to the sprite) are all 12s; rows 2–7 are all 9s.\n  - Other scattered 9s on the board are NOT the player—only the exact 8×8 (2×8 of 12s stacked on 6×8 of 9s) is the player.\n* Movement rules:\n  - You may move only through non-4 cells (i.e., never overlap a 4 after a move).\n  - If any part of your 8×8 sprite would overlap a 4 in the target direction (including cases where 4s lie “under” 9s), that move is ILLEGAL.\n  - If your sprite is already touching 4s on a side, you cannot move further in that touching direction until you have clearance.\n  - Practically: navigate corridors “between the 4s”.\n\n# KEYS, EXIT, AND HOW TO FIND THEM\n* Bottom-left KEY INDICATOR (non-interactive):\n  - A small block of 0s and 9s COMPLETELY BOXED by 4s in the bottom-left of the entire grid.\n  - This is NOT reachable and NOT a gameplay area. It only shows your CURRENT selected key.\n* EXIT (the lock to open):\n  - Elsewhere on the map, the lock is the target 0/9 pattern you must match, adjacent to some 5s (the 5s need not fully surround it).\n  - You may leave the level only when your current key EXACTLY matches this lock’s 0/9 distribution.\n* KEY GENERATOR (interactive, how to generate keys):\n  - Look for a patch consisting of 0s and 9s that has a CLEAR path of 3s leading to it and around it, and is NOT bordered by 5s or boxed by 4s.\n  - When any part of your 8×8 player steps ONTO this patch, it GENERATES a NEW candidate key and updates the bottom-left indicator.\n  - Step OFF the patch and then back ON to generate yet another candidate key; repeat to cycle through the set of keys.\n  - Continue cycling until the bottom-left indicator EXACTLY matches the lock pattern at the exit (the same 0/9 layout adjacent to 5s).\n* Locating things quickly:\n  - Generator: 0/9 patch accessible via 3s, with only 3s around it (no 5s), is almost certainly the generator.\n  - Exit: a matching 0/9 pattern near 5s marks the lock/exit area.\n\n# HUD / PROGRESSION\n* Visual score on the second-to-last grid row (row 62): it contains several 4-cell “slots”.\n  - Slots made of 3s represent UNFINISHED levels.\n  - When a slot changes from 3s to another color, that level is COMPLETE.\n* Track remaining MOVES/ENERGY by counting tiles with value 15.\n* Track LIVES by counting distinct 2×2 blocks of 8s.\n\n# GENERAL NOTES\n* The grid is a bird’s-eye view.\n* If the grid does not change after an action, you likely attempted an illegal move into 4s.\n* Favor routes marked by 3s; use the generator (0/9 patch surrounded by 3s) to cycle keys; confirm the match by comparing the bottom-left indicator (boxed by 4s) to the 0/9 lock pattern found near 5s; then proceed to the exit.\n\n# EXAMPLE STRATEGY OBSERVATION\nThe 8×8 player (top rows 12s, bottom rows 9s) is touching 4s on the left, so LEFT is blocked. I see a 0/9 patch with only 3s around it to the right—that’s likely the generator. I should move RIGHT to step on/off it until the bottom-left indicator (boxed by 4s) matches the lock pattern I see near the 5s, then head to the exit.\n\n# TURN:\nCall exactly one action.\n\n"

    "content": "\n# CONTEXT:\nYou are an agent playing a dynamic game. Your objective is to\nWIN and avoid GAME_OVER while minimizing actions.\n\nOne action produces one Frame. One Frame is made of one or more sequential\nGrids. Each Grid is a matrix size INT<0,63> by INT<0,63> filled with\nINT<0,15> values. Each value represents a different color and usually implies a different object.\n\nYou are playing a game called LockSmith.\n\n# CONTROLS\n* RESET: start over\n* ACTION1: move up\n* ACTION2: move down\n* ACTION3: move left\n* ACTION4: move right\n* ACTION5/ACTION6: no-ops\n\n# ORIENTATION (read carefully)\n* The global frame is fixed: the bottom-left KEY INDICATOR is always at the bottom-left; the EXIT/lock is elsewhere.\n* ACTION1 (UP) moves you toward the area where 15s (move counters) are located; use this as a compass for “up.”\n* ACTION4 (RIGHT) increases your distance from the bottom-left key indicator; ACTION3 (LEFT) decreases it.\n* Legality checks with 4s (walls):\n  - RIGHT is ILLEGAL if any 4s lie immediately to the right (“after” in row order) of any 12/9 cells of your 8×8 player.\n  - LEFT is ILLEGAL if any 4s lie immediately to the left (“before” in row order) of any 12/9 cells of your 8×8 player.\n  - UP is ILLEGAL if any 4s lie directly above the topmost 12 row of your player.\n  - DOWN is ILLEGAL if any 4s lie directly below the bottommost 9 row of your player.\n* Always orient carefully before moving: check where the 15s lie (for UP), how far you are from the bottom-left indicator (for LEFT/RIGHT), and whether 4s precede/follow your 12s/9s in the intended direction.\n\n# GOAL\nFind/generate a key that MATCHES the key pattern shown at the EXIT, then navigate to the EXIT to finish the level.\nThere are 6 levels total. Complete all levels to WIN.\n\n# TILE MEANINGS (important ones)\n* 0 = white cell (used in key patterns)\n* 3 = walkable path / corridor marker (often outlines routes to key/exit)\n* 4 = WALL (solid). You cannot enter 4s.\n* 5 = EXIT indicator (presence of 5s marks/frames the exit area)\n* 8 = LIFE token (count lives as the number of 2×2 blocks of 8s)\n* 9 = blue cells (used in player lower body; also appear elsewhere in the map and in key logic)\n* 12 = orange cells (used in player upper body)\n* 15 = MOVE counter (number of 15s ≈ moves/energy left)\n\n# PLAYER (sprite + movement legality)\n* The player is an 8×8 sprite made ONLY of 12s (top two rows) over 9s (bottom six rows).\n  - Concretely: rows 0–1 (relative to the sprite) are all 12s; rows 2–7 are all 9s.\n  - Other scattered 9s on the board are NOT the player—only the exact 8×8 (2×8 of 12s stacked on 6×8 of 9s) is the player.\n* Movement rules:\n  - You may move only through non-4 cells (i.e., never overlap a 4 after a move).\n  - If any part of your 8×8 sprite would overlap a 4 in the target direction (including cases where 4s lie “under” 9s), that move is ILLEGAL.\n  - If your sprite is already touching 4s on a side, you cannot move further in that touching direction until you have clearance.\n  - Practically: navigate corridors “between the 4s”.\n\n# KEYS, EXIT, AND HOW TO FIND THEM\n* Bottom-left KEY INDICATOR (non-interactive):\n  - A small block of 0s and 9s COMPLETELY BOXED by 4s in the bottom-left of the entire grid.\n  - This is NOT reachable and NOT a gameplay area. It only shows your CURRENT selected key.\n* EXIT (the lock to open):\n  - Elsewhere on the map, the lock is the target 0/9 pattern you must match, adjacent to some 5s (the 5s need not fully surround it).\n  - You may leave the level only when your current key EXACTLY matches this lock’s 0/9 distribution.\n* KEY GENERATOR (interactive, how to generate keys):\n  - Look for a patch consisting of 0s and 9s that has a CLEAR path of 3s leading to it and around it, and is NOT bordered by 5s or boxed by 4s.\n  - When any part of your 8×8 player steps ONTO this patch, it GENERATES a NEW candidate key and updates the bottom-left indicator.\n  - Step OFF the patch and then back ON to generate yet another candidate key; repeat to cycle through the set of keys.\n  - Continue cycling until the bottom-left indicator EXACTLY matches the lock pattern at the exit (the same 0/9 layout adjacent to 5s).\n* Locating things quickly:\n  - Generator: 0/9 patch accessible via 3s, with only 3s around it (no 5s), is almost certainly the generator.\n  - Exit: a matching 0/9 pattern near 5s marks the lock/exit area.\n\n# HUD / PROGRESSION\n* Visual score on the second-to-last grid row (row 62): it contains several 4-cell “slots”.\n  - Slots made of 3s represent UNFINISHED levels.\n  - When a slot changes from 3s to another color, that level is COMPLETE.\n* Track remaining MOVES/ENERGY by counting tiles with value 15.\n* Track LIVES by counting distinct 2×2 blocks of 8s.\n\n# GENERAL NOTES\n* The grid is a bird’s-eye view.\n* If the grid does not change after an action, you likely attempted an illegal move into 4s.\n* Favor routes marked by 3s; use the generator (0/9 patch surrounded by 3s) to cycle keys; confirm the match by comparing the bottom-left indicator (boxed by 4s) to the 0/9 lock pattern found near 5s; then proceed to the exit.\n\n# EXAMPLE STRATEGY OBSERVATION\nThe 8×8 player (top rows 12s, bottom rows 9s) is touching 4s on the left, so LEFT is blocked. I see a 0/9 patch with only 3s around it to the right—that’s likely the generator. I should move RIGHT to step on/off it until the bottom-left indicator (boxed by 4s) matches the lock pattern I see near the 5s, then head to the exit.\n\n# TURN:\nCall exactly one action.\n\n"

    "content": "\n# CONTEXT:\nYou are an agent playing a dynamic game. Your objective is to\nWIN and avoid GAME_OVER while minimizing actions.\n\nOne action produces one Frame. One Frame is made of one or more sequential\nGrids. Each Grid is a matrix size INT<0,63> by INT<0,63> filled with\nINT<0,15> values. Each value represents a different color and usually implies a different object.\n\nYou are playing a game called LockSmith.\n\n# CONTROLS\n* RESET: start over\n* ACTION1: move up\n* ACTION2: move down\n* ACTION3: move left\n* ACTION4: move right\n* ACTION5/ACTION6: no-ops\n\n# ORIENTATION (read carefully)\n* The global frame is fixed: the bottom-left KEY INDICATOR is always at the bottom-left; the EXIT/lock is elsewhere.\n* ACTION1 (UP) moves you toward the area where 15s (move counters) are located; use this as a compass for “up.”\n* ACTION4 (RIGHT) increases your distance from the bottom-left key indicator; ACTION3 (LEFT) decreases it.\n* Legality checks with 4s (walls):\n  - RIGHT is ILLEGAL if any 4s lie immediately to the right (“after” in row order) of any 12/9 cells of your 8×8 player.\n  - LEFT is ILLEGAL if any 4s lie immediately to the left (“before” in row order) of any 12/9 cells of your 8×8 player.\n  - UP is ILLEGAL if any 4s lie directly above the topmost 12 row of your player.\n  - DOWN is ILLEGAL if any 4s lie directly below the bottommost 9 row of your player.\n* Always orient carefully before moving: check where the 15s lie (for UP), how far you are from the bottom-left indicator (for LEFT/RIGHT), and whether 4s precede/follow your 12s/9s in the intended direction.\n\n# GOAL\nFind/generate a key that MATCHES the key pattern shown at the EXIT, then navigate to the EXIT to finish the level.\nThere are 6 levels total. Complete all levels to WIN.\n\n# TILE MEANINGS (important ones)\n* 0 = white cell (used in key patterns)\n* 3 = walkable path / corridor marker (often outlines routes to key/exit)\n* 4 = WALL (solid). You cannot enter 4s.\n* 5 = EXIT indicator (presence of 5s marks/frames the exit area)\n* 8 = LIFE token (count lives as the number of 2×2 blocks of 8s)\n* 9 = blue cells (used in player lower body; also appear elsewhere in the map and in key logic)\n* 12 = orange cells (used in player upper body)\n* 15 = MOVE counter (number of 15s ≈ moves/energy left)\n\n# PLAYER (sprite + movement legality)\n* The player is an 8×8 sprite made ONLY of 12s (top two rows) over 9s (bottom six rows).\n  - Concretely: rows 0–1 (relative to the sprite) are all 12s; rows 2–7 are all 9s.\n  - Other scattered 9s on the board are NOT the player—only the exact 8×8 (2×8 of 12s stacked on 6×8 of 9s) is the player.\n* Movement rules:\n  - You may move only through non-4 cells (i.e., never overlap a 4 after a move).\n  - If any part of your 8×8 sprite would overlap a 4 in the target direction (including cases where 4s lie “under” 9s), that move is ILLEGAL.\n  - If your sprite is already touching 4s on a side, you cannot move further in that touching direction until you have clearance.\n  - Practically: navigate corridors “between the 4s”.\n\n# KEYS, EXIT, AND HOW TO FIND THEM\n* Bottom-left KEY INDICATOR (non-interactive):\n  - A small block of 0s and 9s COMPLETELY BOXED by 4s in the bottom-left of the entire grid.\n  - This is NOT reachable and NOT a gameplay area. It only shows your CURRENT selected key.\n* EXIT (the lock to open):\n  - Elsewhere on the map, the lock is the target 0/9 pattern you must match, adjacent to some 5s (the 5s need not fully surround it).\n  - You may leave the level only when your current key EXACTLY matches this lock’s 0/9 distribution.\n* KEY GENERATOR (interactive, how to generate keys):\n  - Look for a patch consisting of 0s and 9s that has a CLEAR path of 3s leading to it and around it, and is NOT bordered by 5s or boxed by 4s.\n  - When any part of your 8×8 player steps ONTO this patch, it GENERATES a NEW candidate key and updates the bottom-left indicator.\n  - Step OFF the patch and then back ON to generate yet another candidate key; repeat to cycle through the set of keys.\n  - Continue cycling until the bottom-left indicator EXACTLY matches the lock pattern at the exit (the same 0/9 layout adjacent to 5s).\n* Locating things quickly:\n  - Generator: 0/9 patch accessible via 3s, with only 3s around it (no 5s), is almost certainly the generator.\n  - Exit: a matching 0/9 pattern near 5s marks the lock/exit area.\n\n# HUD / PROGRESSION\n* Visual score on the second-to-last grid row (row 62): it contains several 4-cell “slots”.\n  - Slots made of 3s represent UNFINISHED levels.\n  - When a slot changes from 3s to another color, that level is COMPLETE.\n* Track remaining MOVES/ENERGY by counting tiles with value 15.\n* Track LIVES by counting distinct 2×2 blocks of 8s.\n\n# GENERAL NOTES\n* The grid is a bird’s-eye view.\n* If the grid does not change after an action, you likely attempted an illegal move into 4s.\n* Favor routes marked by 3s; use the generator (0/9 patch surrounded by 3s) to cycle keys; confirm the match by comparing the bottom-left indicator (boxed by 4s) to the 0/9 lock pattern found near 5s; then proceed to the exit.\n\n# EXAMPLE STRATEGY OBSERVATION\nThe 8×8 player (top rows 12s, bottom rows 9s) is touching 4s on the left, so LEFT is blocked. I see a 0/9 patch with only 3s around it to the right—that’s likely the generator. I should move RIGHT to step on/off it until the bottom-left indicator (boxed by 4s) matches the lock pattern I see near the 5s, then head to the exit.\n\n# TURN:\nCall exactly one action.\n\n"

    "content": "\n# CONTEXT:\nYou are an agent playing a dynamic game. Your objective is to\nWIN and avoid GAME_OVER while minimizing actions.\n\nOne action produces one Frame. One Frame is made of one or more sequential\nGrids. Each Grid is a matrix size INT<0,63> by INT<0,63> filled with\nINT<0,15> values. Each value represents a different color and usually implies a different object.\n\nYou are playing a game called LockSmith.\n\n# CONTROLS\n* RESET: start over\n* ACTION1: move up\n* ACTION2: move down\n* ACTION3: move left\n* ACTION4: move right\n* ACTION5/ACTION6: no-ops\n\n# ORIENTATION (read carefully)\n* The global frame is fixed: the bottom-left KEY INDICATOR is always at the bottom-left; the EXIT/lock is elsewhere.\n* ACTION1 (UP) moves you toward the area where 15s (move counters) are located; use this as a compass for “up.”\n* ACTION4 (RIGHT) increases your distance from the bottom-left key indicator; ACTION3 (LEFT) decreases it.\n* Legality checks with 4s (walls):\n  - RIGHT is ILLEGAL if any 4s lie immediately to the right (“after” in row order) of any 12/9 cells of your 8×8 player.\n  - LEFT is ILLEGAL if any 4s lie immediately to the left (“before” in row order) of any 12/9 cells of your 8×8 player.\n  - UP is ILLEGAL if any 4s lie directly above the topmost 12 row of your player.\n  - DOWN is ILLEGAL if any 4s lie directly below the bottommost 9 row of your player.\n* Always orient carefully before moving: check where the 15s lie (for UP), how far you are from the bottom-left indicator (for LEFT/RIGHT), and whether 4s precede/follow your 12s/9s in the intended direction.\n\n# GOAL\nFind/generate a key that MATCHES the key pattern shown at the EXIT, then navigate to the EXIT to finish the level.\nThere are 6 levels total. Complete all levels to WIN.\n\n# TILE MEANINGS (important ones)\n* 0 = white cell (used in key patterns)\n* 3 = walkable path / corridor marker (often outlines routes to key/exit)\n* 4 = WALL (solid). You cannot enter 4s.\n* 5 = EXIT indicator (presence of 5s marks/frames the exit area)\n* 8 = LIFE token (count lives as the number of 2×2 blocks of 8s)\n* 9 = blue cells (used in player lower body; also appear elsewhere in the map and in key logic)\n* 12 = orange cells (used in player upper body)\n* 15 = MOVE counter (number of 15s ≈ moves/energy left)\n\n# PLAYER (sprite + movement legality)\n* The player is an 8×8 sprite made ONLY of 12s (top two rows) over 9s (bottom six rows).\n  - Concretely: rows 0–1 (relative to the sprite) are all 12s; rows 2–7 are all 9s.\n  - Other scattered 9s on the board are NOT the player—only the exact 8×8 (2×8 of 12s stacked on 6×8 of 9s) is the player.\n* Movement rules:\n  - You may move only through non-4 cells (i.e., never overlap a 4 after a move).\n  - If any part of your 8×8 sprite would overlap a 4 in the target direction (including cases where 4s lie “under” 9s), that move is ILLEGAL.\n  - If your sprite is already touching 4s on a side, you cannot move further in that touching direction until you have clearance.\n  - Practically: navigate corridors “between the 4s”.\n\n# KEYS, EXIT, AND HOW TO FIND THEM\n* Bottom-left KEY INDICATOR (non-interactive):\n  - A small block of 0s and 9s COMPLETELY BOXED by 4s in the bottom-left of the entire grid.\n  - This is NOT reachable and NOT a gameplay area. It only shows your CURRENT selected key.\n* EXIT (the lock to open):\n  - Elsewhere on the map, the lock is the target 0/9 pattern you must match, adjacent to some 5s (the 5s need not fully surround it).\n  - You may leave the level only when your current key EXACTLY matches this lock’s 0/9 distribution.\n* KEY GENERATOR (interactive, how to generate keys):\n  - Look for a patch consisting of 0s and 9s that has a CLEAR path of 3s leading to it and around it, and is NOT bordered by 5s or boxed by 4s.\n  - When any part of your 8×8 player steps ONTO this patch, it GENERATES a NEW candidate key and updates the bottom-left indicator.\n  - Step OFF the patch and then back ON to generate yet another candidate key; repeat to cycle through the set of keys.\n  - Continue cycling until the bottom-left indicator EXACTLY matches the lock pattern at the exit (the same 0/9 layout adjacent to 5s).\n* Locating things quickly:\n  - Generator: 0/9 patch accessible via 3s, with only 3s around it (no 5s), is almost certainly the generator.\n  - Exit: a matching 0/9 pattern near 5s marks the lock/exit area.\n\n# HUD / PROGRESSION\n* Visual score on the second-to-last grid row (row 62): it contains several 4-cell “slots”.\n  - Slots made of 3s represent UNFINISHED levels.\n  - When a slot changes from 3s to another color, that level is COMPLETE.\n* Track remaining MOVES/ENERGY by counting tiles with value 15.\n* Track LIVES by counting distinct 2×2 blocks of 8s.\n\n# GENERAL NOTES\n* The grid is a bird’s-eye view.\n* If the grid does not change after an action, you likely attempted an illegal move into 4s.\n* Favor routes marked by 3s; use the generator (0/9 patch surrounded by 3s) to cycle keys; confirm the match by comparing the bottom-left indicator (boxed by 4s) to the 0/9 lock pattern found near 5s; then proceed to the exit.\n\n# EXAMPLE STRATEGY OBSERVATION\nThe 8×8 player (top rows 12s, bottom rows 9s) is touching 4s on the left, so LEFT is blocked. I see a 0/9 patch with only 3s around it to the right—that’s likely the generator. I should move RIGHT to step on/off it until the bottom-left indicator (boxed by 4s) matches the lock pattern I see near the 5s, then head to the exit.\n\n# TURN:\nCall exactly one action.\n\n"

Each value represents a different color and usually implies a different object.\n\nYou are playing a game called LockSmith.\n\n# CONTROLS\n* RESET: start over\n* ACTION1: move up\n* ACTION2: move down\n* ACTION3: move left\n* ACTION4: move right\n* ACTION5/ACTION6: no-ops\n\n# ORIENTATION (read carefully)\n* The global frame is fixed: the bottom-left KEY INDICATOR is always at the bottom-left; the EXIT/lock is elsewhere.\n* ACTION1 (UP) moves you toward the area where 15s (move counters) are located; use this as a compass for “up.”\n* ACTION4 (RIGHT) increases your distance from the bottom-left key indicator; ACTION3 (LEFT) decreases it.\n* Legality checks with 4s (walls):\n  - RIGHT is ILLEGAL if any 4s lie immediately to the right (“after” in row order) of any 12/9 cells of your 8×8 player.\n  - LEFT is ILLEGAL if any 4s lie immediately to the left (“before” in row order) of any 12/9 cells of your 8×8 player.\n  - UP is ILLEGAL if any 4s lie directly above the topmost 12 row of your player.\n  - DOWN is ILLEGAL if any 4s lie directly below the bottommost 9 row of your player.\n* Always orient carefully before moving: check where the 15s lie (for UP), how far you are from the bottom-left indicator (for LEFT/RIGHT), and whether 4s precede/follow your 12s/9s in the intended direction.\n\n# GOAL\nFind/generate a key that MATCHES the key pattern shown at the EXIT, then navigate to the EXIT to finish the level.\nThere are 6 levels total. Complete all levels to WIN.\n\n# TILE MEANINGS (important ones)\n* 0 = white cell (used in key patterns)\n* 3 = walkable path / corridor marker (often outlines routes to key/exit)\n* 4 = WALL (solid). You cannot enter 4s.\n* 5 = EXIT indicator (presence of 5s marks/frames the exit area)\n* 8 = LIFE token (count lives as the number of 2×2 blocks of 8s)\n* 9 = blue cells (used in player lower body; also appear elsewhere in the map and in key logic)\n* 12 = orange cells (used in player upper body)\n* 15 = MOVE counter (number of 15s ≈ moves/energy left)\n\n# PLAYER (sprite + movement legality)\n* The player is an 8×8 sprite made ONLY of 12s (top two rows) over 9s (bottom six rows).\n  - Concretely: rows 0–1 (relative to the sprite) are all 12s; rows 2–7 are all 9s.\n  - Other scattered 9s on the board are NOT the player—only the exact 8×8 (2×8 of 12s stacked on 6×8 of 9s) is the player.\n* Movement rules:\n  - You may move only through non-4 cells (i.e., never overlap a 4 after a move).\n  - If any part of your 8×8 sprite would overlap a 4 in the target direction (including cases where 4s lie “under” 9s), that move is ILLEGAL.\n  - If your sprite is already touching 4s on a side, you cannot move further in that touching direction until you have clearance.\n  - Practically: navigate corridors “between the 4s”.\n\n# KEYS, EXIT, AND HOW TO FIND THEM\n* Bottom-left KEY INDICATOR (non-interactive):\n  - A small block of 0s and 9s COMPLETELY BOXED by 4s in the bottom-left of the entire grid.\n  - This is NOT reachable and NOT a gameplay area. It only shows your CURRENT selected key.\n* EXIT (the lock to open):\n  - Elsewhere on the map, the lock is the target 0/9 pattern you must match, adjacent to some 5s (the 5s need not fully surround it).\n  - You may leave the level only when your current key EXACTLY matches this lock’s 0/9 distribution.\n* KEY GENERATOR (interactive, how to generate keys):\n  - Look for a patch consisting of 0s and 9s that has a CLEAR path of 3s leading to it and around it, and is NOT bordered by 5s or boxed by 4s.\n  - When any part of your 8×8 player steps ONTO this patch, it GENERATES a NEW candidate key and updates the bottom-left indicator.\n  - Step OFF the patch and then back ON to generate yet another candidate key; repeat to cycle through the set of keys.\n  - Continue cycling until the bottom-left indicator EXACTLY matches the lock pattern at the exit (the same 0/9 layout adjacent to 5s).\n* Locating things quickly:\n  - Generator: 0/9 patch accessible via 3s, with only 3s around it (no 5s), is almost certainly the generator.\n  - Exit: a matching 0/9 pattern near 5s marks the lock/exit area.\n\n# HUD / PROGRESSION\n* Visual score on the second-to-last grid row (row 62): it contains several 4-cell “slots”.\n  - Slots made of 3s represent UNFINISHED levels.\n  - When a slot changes from 3s to another color, that level is COMPLETE.\n* Track remaining MOVES/ENERGY by counting tiles with value 15.\n* Track LIVES by counting distinct 2×2 blocks of 8s.\n\n# GENERAL NOTES\n* The grid is a bird’s-eye view.\n* If the grid does not change after an action, you likely attempted an illegal move into 4s.\n* Favor routes marked by 3s; use the generator (0/9 patch surrounded by 3s) to cycle keys; confirm the match by comparing the bottom-left indicator (boxed by 4s) to the 0/9 lock pattern found near 5s; then proceed to the exit.\n\n# EXAMPLE STRATEGY OBSERVATION\nThe 8×8 player (top rows 12s, bottom rows 9s) is touching 4s on the left, so LEFT is blocked. I see a 0/9 patch with only 3s around it to the right—that’s likely the generator. I should move RIGHT to step on/off it until the bottom-left indicator (boxed by 4s) matches the lock pattern I see near the 5s, then head to the exit.\n\n# TURN:\nCall exactly one action.\n\n"

    "content": "\n# CONTEXT:\nYou are an agent playing a dynamic game. Your objective is to\nWIN and avoid GAME_OVER while minimizing actions.\n\nOne action produces one Frame. One Frame is made of one or more sequential\nGrids. Each Grid is a matrix size INT<0,63> by INT<0,63> filled with\nINT<0,15> values. Each value represents a different color and usually implies a different object.\n\nYou are playing a game called LockSmith.\n\n# CONTROLS\n* RESET: start over\n* ACTION1: move up\n* ACTION2: move down\n* ACTION3: move left\n* ACTION4: move right\n* ACTION5/ACTION6: no-ops\n\n# ORIENTATION (read carefully)\n* The global frame is fixed: the bottom-left KEY INDICATOR is always at the bottom-left; the EXIT/lock is elsewhere.\n* ACTION1 (UP) moves you toward the area where 15s (move counters) are located; use this as a compass for “up.”\n* ACTION4 (RIGHT) increases your distance from the bottom-left key indicator; ACTION3 (LEFT) decreases it.\n* Legality checks with 4s (walls):\n  - RIGHT is ILLEGAL if any 4s lie immediately to the right (“after” in row order) of any 12/9 cells of your 8×8 player.\n  - LEFT is ILLEGAL if any 4s lie immediately to the left (“before” in row order) of any 12/9 cells of your 8×8 player.\n  - UP is ILLEGAL if any 4s lie directly above the topmost 12 row of your player.\n  - DOWN is ILLEGAL if any 4s lie directly below the bottommost 9 row of your player.\n* Always orient carefully before moving: check where the 15s lie (for UP), how far you are from the bottom-left indicator (for LEFT/RIGHT), and whether 4s precede/follow your 12s/9s in the intended direction.\n\n# GOAL\nFind/generate a key that MATCHES the key pattern shown at the EXIT, then navigate to the EXIT to finish the level.\nThere are 6 levels total. Complete all levels to WIN.\n\n# TILE MEANINGS (important ones)\n* 0 = white cell (used in key patterns)\n* 3 = walkable path / corridor marker (often outlines routes to key/exit)\n* 4 = WALL (solid). You cannot enter 4s.\n* 5 = EXIT indicator (presence of 5s marks/frames the exit area)\n* 8 = LIFE token (count lives as the number of 2×2 blocks of 8s)\n* 9 = blue cells (used in player lower body; also appear elsewhere in the map and in key logic)\n* 12 = orange cells (used in player upper body)\n* 15 = MOVE counter (number of 15s ≈ moves/energy left)\n\n# PLAYER (sprite + movement legality)\n* The player is an 8×8 sprite made ONLY of 12s (top two rows) over 9s (bottom six rows).\n  - Concretely: rows 0–1 (relative to the sprite) are all 12s; rows 2–7 are all 9s.\n  - Other scattered 9s on the board are NOT the player—only the exact 8×8 (2×8 of 12s stacked on 6×8 of 9s) is the player.\n* Movement rules:\n  - You may move only through non-4 cells (i.e., never overlap a 4 after a move).\n  - If any part of your 8×8 sprite would overlap a 4 in the target direction (including cases where 4s lie “under” 9s), that move is ILLEGAL.\n  - If your sprite is already touching 4s on a side, you cannot move further in that touching direction until you have clearance.\n  - Practically: navigate corridors “between the 4s”.\n\n# KEYS, EXIT, AND HOW TO FIND THEM\n* Bottom-left KEY INDICATOR (non-interactive):\n  - A small block of 0s and 9s COMPLETELY BOXED by 4s in the bottom-left of the entire grid.\n  - This is NOT reachable and NOT a gameplay area. It only shows your CURRENT selected key.\n* EXIT (the lock to open):\n  - Elsewhere on the map, the lock is the target 0/9 pattern you must match, adjacent to some 5s (the 5s need not fully surround it).\n  - You may leave the level only when your current key EXACTLY matches this lock’s 0/9 distribution.\n* KEY GENERATOR (interactive, how to generate keys):\n  - Look for a patch consisting of 0s and 9s that has a CLEAR path of 3s leading to it and around it, and is NOT bordered by 5s or boxed by 4s.\n  - When any part of your 8×8 player steps ONTO this patch, it GENERATES a NEW candidate key and updates the bottom-left indicator.\n  - Step OFF the patch and then back ON to generate yet another candidate key; repeat to cycle through the set of keys.\n  - Continue cycling until the bottom-left indicator EXACTLY matches the lock pattern at the exit (the same 0/9 layout adjacent to 5s).\n* Locating things quickly:\n  - Generator: 0/9 patch accessible via 3s, with only 3s around it (no 5s), is almost certainly the generator.\n  - Exit: a matching 0/9 pattern near 5s marks the lock/exit area.\n\n# HUD / PROGRESSION\n* Visual score on the second-to-last grid row (row 62): it contains several 4-cell “slots”.\n  - Slots made of 3s represent UNFINISHED levels.\n  - When a slot changes from 3s to another color, that level is COMPLETE.\n* Track remaining MOVES/ENERGY by counting tiles with value 15.\n* Track LIVES by counting distinct 2×2 blocks of 8s.\n\n# GENERAL NOTES\n* The grid is a bird’s-eye view.\n* If the grid does not change after an action, you likely attempted an illegal move into 4s.\n* Favor routes marked by 3s; use the generator (0/9 patch surrounded by 3s) to cycle keys; confirm the match by comparing the bottom-left indicator (boxed by 4s) to the 0/9 lock pattern found near 5s; then proceed to the exit.\n\n# EXAMPLE STRATEGY OBSERVATION\nThe 8×8 player (top rows 12s, bottom rows 9s) is touching 4s on the left, so LEFT is blocked. I see a 0/9 patch with only 3s around it to the right—that’s likely the generator. I should move RIGHT to step on/off it until the bottom-left indicator (boxed by 4s) matches the lock pattern I see near the 5s, then head to the exit.\n\n# TURN:\nCall exactly one action.\n\n"

Each value represents a different color and usually implies a different object.\n\nYou are playing a game called LockSmith.\n\n# CONTROLS\n* RESET: start over\n* ACTION1: move up\n* ACTION2: move down\n* ACTION3: move left\n* ACTION4: move right\n* ACTION5/ACTION6: no-ops\n\n# ORIENTATION (read carefully)\n* The global frame is fixed: the bottom-left KEY INDICATOR is always at the bottom-left; the EXIT/lock is elsewhere.\n* ACTION1 (UP) moves you toward the area where 15s (move counters) are located; use this as a compass for “up.”\n* ACTION4 (RIGHT) increases your distance from the bottom-left key indicator; ACTION3 (LEFT) decreases it.\n* Legality checks with 4s (walls):\n  - RIGHT is ILLEGAL if any 4s lie immediately to the right (“after” in row order) of any 12/9 cells of your 8×8 player.\n  - LEFT is ILLEGAL if any 4s lie immediately to the left (“before” in row order) of any 12/9 cells of your 8×8 player.\n  - UP is ILLEGAL if any 4s lie directly above the topmost 12 row of your player.\n  - DOWN is ILLEGAL if any 4s lie directly below the bottommost 9 row of your player.\n* Always orient carefully before moving: check where the 15s lie (for UP), how far you are from the bottom-left indicator (for LEFT/RIGHT), and whether 4s precede/follow your 12s/9s in the intended direction.\n\n# GOAL\nFind/generate a key that MATCHES the key pattern shown at the EXIT, then navigate to the EXIT to finish the level.\nThere are 6 levels total. Complete all levels to WIN.\n\n# TILE MEANINGS (important ones)\n* 0 = white cell (used in key patterns)\n* 3 = walkable path / corridor marker (often outlines routes to key/exit)\n* 4 = WALL (solid). You cannot enter 4s.\n* 5 = EXIT indicator (presence of 5s marks/frames the exit area)\n* 8 = LIFE token (count lives as the number of 2×2 blocks of 8s)\n* 9 = blue cells (used in player lower body; also appear elsewhere in the map and in key logic)\n* 12 = orange cells (used in player upper body)\n* 15 = MOVE counter (number of 15s ≈ moves/energy left)\n\n# PLAYER (sprite + movement legality)\n* The player is an 8×8 sprite made ONLY of 12s (top two rows) over 9s (bottom six rows).\n  - Concretely: rows 0–1 (relative to the sprite) are all 12s; rows 2–7 are all 9s.\n  - Other scattered 9s on the board are NOT the player—only the exact 8×8 (2×8 of 12s stacked on 6×8 of 9s) is the player.\n* Movement rules:\n  - You may move only through non-4 cells (i.e., never overlap a 4 after a move).\n  - If any part of your 8×8 sprite would overlap a 4 in the target direction (including cases where 4s lie “under” 9s), that move is ILLEGAL.\n  - If your sprite is already touching 4s on a side, you cannot move further in that touching direction until you have clearance.\n  - Practically: navigate corridors “between the 4s”.\n\n# KEYS, EXIT, AND HOW TO FIND THEM\n* Bottom-left KEY INDICATOR (non-interactive):\n  - A small block of 0s and 9s COMPLETELY BOXED by 4s in the bottom-left of the entire grid.\n  - This is NOT reachable and NOT a gameplay area. It only shows your CURRENT selected key.\n* EXIT (the lock to open):\n  - Elsewhere on the map, the lock is the target 0/9 pattern you must match, adjacent to some 5s (the 5s need not fully surround it).\n  - You may leave the level only when your current key EXACTLY matches this lock’s 0/9 distribution.\n* KEY GENERATOR (interactive, how to generate keys):\n  - Look for a patch consisting of 0s and 9s that has a CLEAR path of 3s leading to it and around it, and is NOT bordered by 5s or boxed by 4s.\n  - When any part of your 8×8 player steps ONTO this patch, it GENERATES a NEW candidate key and updates the bottom-left indicator.\n  - Step OFF the patch and then back ON to generate yet another candidate key; repeat to cycle through the set of keys.\n  - Continue cycling until the bottom-left indicator EXACTLY matches the lock pattern at the exit (the same 0/9 layout adjacent to 5s).\n* Locating things quickly:\n  - Generator: 0/9 patch accessible via 3s, with only 3s around it (no 5s), is almost certainly the generator.\n  - Exit: a matching 0/9 pattern near 5s marks the lock/exit area.\n\n# HUD / PROGRESSION\n* Visual score on the second-to-last grid row (row 62): it contains several 4-cell “slots”.\n  - Slots made of 3s represent UNFINISHED levels.\n  - When a slot changes from 3s to another color, that level is COMPLETE.\n* Track remaining MOVES/ENERGY by counting tiles with value 15.\n* Track LIVES by counting distinct 2×2 blocks of 8s.\n\n# GENERAL NOTES\n* The grid is a bird’s-eye view.\n* If the grid does not change after an action, you likely attempted an illegal move into 4s.\n* Favor routes marked by 3s; use the generator (0/9 patch surrounded by 3s) to cycle keys; confirm the match by comparing the bottom-left indicator (boxed by 4s) to the 0/9 lock pattern found near 5s; then proceed to the exit.\n\n# EXAMPLE STRATEGY OBSERVATION\nThe 8×8 player (top rows 12s, bottom rows 9s) is touching 4s on the left, so LEFT is blocked. I see a 0/9 patch with only 3s around it to the right—that’s likely the generator. I should move RIGHT to step on/off it until the bottom-left indicator (boxed by 4s) matches the lock pattern I see near the 5s, then head to the exit.\n\n# TURN:\nCall exactly one action.\n\n"

One Frame is made of one or more sequential\nGrids. Each Grid is a matrix size INT<0,63> by INT<0,63> filled with\nINT<0,15> values. Each value represents a different color and usually implies a different object.\n\nYou are playing a game called LockSmith.\n\n# CONTROLS\n* RESET: start over\n* ACTION1: move up\n* ACTION2: move down\n* ACTION3: move left\n* ACTION4: move right\n* ACTION5/ACTION6: no-ops\n\n# ORIENTATION (read carefully)\n* The global frame is fixed: the bottom-left KEY INDICATOR is always at the bottom-left; the EXIT/lock is elsewhere.\n* ACTION1 (UP) moves you toward the area where 15s (move counters) are located; use this as a compass for “up.”\n* ACTION4 (RIGHT) increases your distance from the bottom-left key indicator; ACTION3 (LEFT) decreases it.\n* Legality checks with 4s (walls):\n  - RIGHT is ILLEGAL if any 4s lie immediately to the right (“after” in row order) of any 12/9 cells of your 8×8 player.\n  - LEFT is ILLEGAL if any 4s lie immediately to the left (“before” in row order) of any 12/9 cells of your 8×8 player.\n  - UP is ILLEGAL if any 4s lie directly above the topmost 12 row of your player.\n  - DOWN is ILLEGAL if any 4s lie directly below the bottommost 9 row of your player.\n* Always orient carefully before moving: check where the 15s lie (for UP), how far you are from the bottom-left indicator (for LEFT/RIGHT), and whether 4s precede/follow your 12s/9s in the intended direction.\n\n# GOAL\nFind/generate a key that MATCHES the key pattern shown at the EXIT, then navigate to the EXIT to finish the level.\nThere are 6 levels total. Complete all levels to WIN.\n\n# TILE MEANINGS (important ones)\n* 0 = white cell (used in key patterns)\n* 3 = walkable path / corridor marker (often outlines routes to key/exit)\n* 4 = WALL (solid). You cannot enter 4s.\n* 5 = EXIT indicator (presence of 5s marks/frames the exit area)\n* 8 = LIFE token (count lives as the number of 2×2 blocks of 8s)\n* 9 = blue cells (used in player lower body; also appear elsewhere in the map and in key logic)\n* 12 = orange cells (used in player upper body)\n* 15 = MOVE counter (number of 15s ≈ moves/energy left)\n\n# PLAYER (sprite + movement legality)\n* The player is an 8×8 sprite made ONLY of 12s (top two rows) over 9s (bottom six rows).\n  - Concretely: rows 0–1 (relative to the sprite) are all 12s; rows 2–7 are all 9s.\n  - Other scattered 9s on the board are NOT the player—only the exact 8×8 (2×8 of 12s stacked on 6×8 of 9s) is the player.\n* Movement rules:\n  - You may move only through non-4 cells (i.e., never overlap a 4 after a move).\n  - If any part of your 8×8 sprite would overlap a 4 in the target direction (including cases where 4s lie “under” 9s), that move is ILLEGAL.\n  - If your sprite is already touching 4s on a side, you cannot move further in that touching direction until you have clearance.\n  - Practically: navigate corridors “between the 4s”.\n\n# KEYS, EXIT, AND HOW TO FIND THEM\n* Bottom-left KEY INDICATOR (non-interactive):\n  - A small block of 0s and 9s COMPLETELY BOXED by 4s in the bottom-left of the entire grid.\n  - This is NOT reachable and NOT a gameplay area. It only shows your CURRENT selected key.\n* EXIT (the lock to open):\n  - Elsewhere on the map, the lock is the target 0/9 pattern you must match, adjacent to some 5s (the 5s need not fully surround it).\n  - You may leave the level only when your current key EXACTLY matches this lock’s 0/9 distribution.\n* KEY GENERATOR (interactive, how to generate keys):\n  - Look for a patch consisting of 0s and 9s that has a CLEAR path of 3s leading to it and around it, and is NOT bordered by 5s or boxed by 4s.\n  - When any part of your 8×8 player steps ONTO this patch, it GENERATES a NEW candidate key and updates the bottom-left indicator.\n  - Step OFF the patch and then back ON to generate yet another candidate key; repeat to cycle through the set of keys.\n  - Continue cycling until the bottom-left indicator EXACTLY matches the lock pattern at the exit (the same 0/9 layout adjacent to 5s).\n* Locating things quickly:\n  - Generator: 0/9 patch accessible via 3s, with only 3s around it (no 5s), is almost certainly the generator.\n  - Exit: a matching 0/9 pattern near 5s marks the lock/exit area.\n\n# HUD / PROGRESSION\n* Visual score on the second-to-last grid row (row 62): it contains several 4-cell “slots”.\n  - Slots made of 3s represent UNFINISHED levels.\n  - When a slot changes from 3s to another color, that level is COMPLETE.\n* Track remaining MOVES/ENERGY by counting tiles with value 15.\n* Track LIVES by counting distinct 2×2 blocks of 8s.\n\n# GENERAL NOTES\n* The grid is a bird’s-eye view.\n* If the grid does not change after an action, you likely attempted an illegal move into 4s.\n* Favor routes marked by 3s; use the generator (0/9 patch surrounded by 3s) to cycle keys; confirm the match by comparing the bottom-left indicator (boxed by 4s) to the 0/9 lock pattern found near 5s; then proceed to the exit.\n\n# EXAMPLE STRATEGY OBSERVATION\nThe 8×8 player (top rows 12s, bottom rows 9s) is touching 4s on the left, so LEFT is blocked. I see a 0/9 patch with only 3s around it to the right—that’s likely the generator. I should move RIGHT to step on/off it until the bottom-left indicator (boxed by 4s) matches the lock pattern I see near the 5s, then head to the exit.\n\n# TURN:\nCall exactly one action.\n\n"

One Frame is made of one or more sequential\nGrids. Each Grid is a matrix size INT<0,63> by INT<0,63> filled with\nINT<0,15> values. Each value represents a different color and usually implies a different object.\n\nYou are playing a game called LockSmith.\n\n# CONTROLS\n* RESET: start over\n* ACTION1: move up\n* ACTION2: move down\n* ACTION3: move left\n* ACTION4: move right\n* ACTION5/ACTION6: no-ops\n\n# ORIENTATION (read carefully)\n* The global frame is fixed: the bottom-left KEY INDICATOR is always at the bottom-left; the EXIT/lock is elsewhere.\n* ACTION1 (UP) moves you toward the area where 15s (move counters) are located; use this as a compass for “up.”\n* ACTION4 (RIGHT) increases your distance from the bottom-left key indicator; ACTION3 (LEFT) decreases it.\n* Legality checks with 4s (walls):\n  - RIGHT is ILLEGAL if any 4s lie immediately to the right (“after” in row order) of any 12/9 cells of your 8×8 player.\n  - LEFT is ILLEGAL if any 4s lie immediately to the left (“before” in row order) of any 12/9 cells of your 8×8 player.\n  - UP is ILLEGAL if any 4s lie directly above the topmost 12 row of your player.\n  - DOWN is ILLEGAL if any 4s lie directly below the bottommost 9 row of your player.\n* Always orient carefully before moving: check where the 15s lie (for UP), how far you are from the bottom-left indicator (for LEFT/RIGHT), and whether 4s precede/follow your 12s/9s in the intended direction.\n\n# GOAL\nFind/generate a key that MATCHES the key pattern shown at the EXIT, then navigate to the EXIT to finish the level.\nThere are 6 levels total. Complete all levels to WIN.\n\n# TILE MEANINGS (important ones)\n* 0 = white cell (used in key patterns)\n* 3 = walkable path / corridor marker (often outlines routes to key/exit)\n* 4 = WALL (solid). You cannot enter 4s.\n* 5 = EXIT indicator (presence of 5s marks/frames the exit area)\n* 8 = LIFE token (count lives as the number of 2×2 blocks of 8s)\n* 9 = blue cells (used in player lower body; also appear elsewhere in the map and in key logic)\n* 12 = orange cells (used in player upper body)\n* 15 = MOVE counter (number of 15s ≈ moves/energy left)\n\n# PLAYER (sprite + movement legality)\n* The player is an 8×8 sprite made ONLY of 12s (top two rows) over 9s (bottom six rows).\n  - Concretely: rows 0–1 (relative to the sprite) are all 12s; rows 2–7 are all 9s.\n  - Other scattered 9s on the board are NOT the player—only the exact 8×8 (2×8 of 12s stacked on 6×8 of 9s) is the player.\n* Movement rules:\n  - You may move only through non-4 cells (i.e., never overlap a 4 after a move).\n  - If any part of your 8×8 sprite would overlap a 4 in the target direction (including cases where 4s lie “under” 9s), that move is ILLEGAL.\n  - If your sprite is already touching 4s on a side, you cannot move further in that touching direction until you have clearance.\n  - Practically: navigate corridors “between the 4s”.\n\n# KEYS, EXIT, AND HOW TO FIND THEM\n* Bottom-left KEY INDICATOR (non-interactive):\n  - A small block of 0s and 9s COMPLETELY BOXED by 4s in the bottom-left of the entire grid.\n  - This is NOT reachable and NOT a gameplay area. It only shows your CURRENT selected key.\n* EXIT (the lock to open):\n  - Elsewhere on the map, the lock is the target 0/9 pattern you must match, adjacent to some 5s (the 5s need not fully surround it).\n  - You may leave the level only when your current key EXACTLY matches this lock’s 0/9 distribution.\n* KEY GENERATOR (interactive, how to generate keys):\n  - Look for a patch consisting of 0s and 9s that has a CLEAR path of 3s leading to it and around it, and is NOT bordered by 5s or boxed by 4s.\n  - When any part of your 8×8 player steps ONTO this patch, it GENERATES a NEW candidate key and updates the bottom-left indicator.\n  - Step OFF the patch and then back ON to generate yet another candidate key; repeat to cycle through the set of keys.\n  - Continue cycling until the bottom-left indicator EXACTLY matches the lock pattern at the exit (the same 0/9 layout adjacent to 5s).\n* Locating things quickly:\n  - Generator: 0/9 patch accessible via 3s, with only 3s around it (no 5s), is almost certainly the generator.\n  - Exit: a matching 0/9 pattern near 5s marks the lock/exit area.\n\n# HUD / PROGRESSION\n* Visual score on the second-to-last grid row (row 62): it contains several 4-cell “slots”.\n  - Slots made of 3s represent UNFINISHED levels.\n  - When a slot changes from 3s to another color, that level is COMPLETE.\n* Track remaining MOVES/ENERGY by counting tiles with value 15.\n* Track LIVES by counting distinct 2×2 blocks of 8s.\n\n# GENERAL NOTES\n* The grid is a bird’s-eye view.\n* If the grid does not change after an action, you likely attempted an illegal move into 4s.\n* Favor routes marked by 3s; use the generator (0/9 patch surrounded by 3s) to cycle keys; confirm the match by comparing the bottom-left indicator (boxed by 4s) to the 0/9 lock pattern found near 5s; then proceed to the exit.\n\n# EXAMPLE STRATEGY OBSERVATION\nThe 8×8 player (top rows 12s, bottom rows 9s) is touching 4s on the left, so LEFT is blocked. I see a 0/9 patch with only 3s around it to the right—that’s likely the generator. I should move RIGHT to step on/off it until the bottom-left indicator (boxed by 4s) matches the lock pattern I see near the 5s, then head to the exit.\n\n# TURN:\nCall exactly one action.\n\n"

    "content": "\n# CONTEXT:\nYou are an agent playing a dynamic game. Your objective is to\nWIN and avoid GAME_OVER while minimizing actions.\n\nOne action produces one Frame. One Frame is made of one or more sequential\nGrids. Each Grid is a matrix size INT<0,63> by INT<0,63> filled with\nINT<0,15> values. Each value represents a different color and usually implies a different object.\n\nYou are playing a game called LockSmith.\n\n# CONTROLS\n* RESET: start over\n* ACTION1: move up\n* ACTION2: move down\n* ACTION3: move left\n* ACTION4: move right\n* ACTION5/ACTION6: no-ops\n\n# ORIENTATION (read carefully)\n* The global frame is fixed: the bottom-left KEY INDICATOR is always at the bottom-left; the EXIT/lock is elsewhere.\n* ACTION1 (UP) moves you toward the area where 15s (move counters) are located; use this as a compass for “up.”\n* ACTION4 (RIGHT) increases your distance from the bottom-left key indicator; ACTION3 (LEFT) decreases it.\n* Legality checks with 4s (walls):\n  - RIGHT is ILLEGAL if any 4s lie immediately to the right (“after” in row order) of any 12/9 cells of your 8×8 player.\n  - LEFT is ILLEGAL if any 4s lie immediately to the left (“before” in row order) of any 12/9 cells of your 8×8 player.\n  - UP is ILLEGAL if any 4s lie directly above the topmost 12 row of your player.\n  - DOWN is ILLEGAL if any 4s lie directly below the bottommost 9 row of your player.\n* Always orient carefully before moving: check where the 15s lie (for UP), how far you are from the bottom-left indicator (for LEFT/RIGHT), and whether 4s precede/follow your 12s/9s in the intended direction.\n\n# GOAL\nFind/generate a key that MATCHES the key pattern shown at the EXIT, then navigate to the EXIT to finish the level.\nThere are 6 levels total. Complete all levels to WIN.\n\n# TILE MEANINGS (important ones)\n* 0 = white cell (used in key patterns)\n* 3 = walkable path / corridor marker (often outlines routes to key/exit)\n* 4 = WALL (solid). You cannot enter 4s.\n* 5 = EXIT indicator (presence of 5s marks/frames the exit area)\n* 8 = LIFE token (count lives as the number of 2×2 blocks of 8s)\n* 9 = blue cells (used in player lower body; also appear elsewhere in the map and in key logic)\n* 12 = orange cells (used in player upper body)\n* 15 = MOVE counter (number of 15s ≈ moves/energy left)\n\n# PLAYER (sprite + movement legality)\n* The player is an 8×8 sprite made ONLY of 12s (top two rows) over 9s (bottom six rows).\n  - Concretely: rows 0–1 (relative to the sprite) are all 12s; rows 2–7 are all 9s.\n  - Other scattered 9s on the board are NOT the player—only the exact 8×8 (2×8 of 12s stacked on 6×8 of 9s) is the player.\n* Movement rules:\n  - You may move only through non-4 cells (i.e., never overlap a 4 after a move).\n  - If any part of your 8×8 sprite would overlap a 4 in the target direction (including cases where 4s lie “under” 9s), that move is ILLEGAL.\n  - If your sprite is already touching 4s on a side, you cannot move further in that touching direction until you have clearance.\n  - Practically: navigate corridors “between the 4s”.\n\n# KEYS, EXIT, AND HOW TO FIND THEM\n* Bottom-left KEY INDICATOR (non-interactive):\n  - A small block of 0s and 9s COMPLETELY BOXED by 4s in the bottom-left of the entire grid.\n  - This is NOT reachable and NOT a gameplay area. It only shows your CURRENT selected key.\n* EXIT (the lock to open):\n  - Elsewhere on the map, the lock is the target 0/9 pattern you must match, adjacent to some 5s (the 5s need not fully surround it).\n  - You may leave the level only when your current key EXACTLY matches this lock’s 0/9 distribution.\n* KEY GENERATOR (interactive, how to generate keys):\n  - Look for a patch consisting of 0s and 9s that has a CLEAR path of 3s leading to it and around it, and is NOT bordered by 5s or boxed by 4s.\n  - When any part of your 8×8 player steps ONTO this patch, it GENERATES a NEW candidate key and updates the bottom-left indicator.\n  - Step OFF the patch and then back ON to generate yet another candidate key; repeat to cycle through the set of keys.\n  - Continue cycling until the bottom-left indicator EXACTLY matches the lock pattern at the exit (the same 0/9 layout adjacent to 5s).\n* Locating things quickly:\n  - Generator: 0/9 patch accessible via 3s, with only 3s around it (no 5s), is almost certainly the generator.\n  - Exit: a matching 0/9 pattern near 5s marks the lock/exit area.\n\n# HUD / PROGRESSION\n* Visual score on the second-to-last grid row (row 62): it contains several 4-cell “slots”.\n  - Slots made of 3s represent UNFINISHED levels.\n  - When a slot changes from 3s to another color, that level is COMPLETE.\n* Track remaining MOVES/ENERGY by counting tiles with value 15.\n* Track LIVES by counting distinct 2×2 blocks of 8s.\n\n# GENERAL NOTES\n* The grid is a bird’s-eye view.\n* If the grid does not change after an action, you likely attempted an illegal move into 4s.\n* Favor routes marked by 3s; use the generator (0/9 patch surrounded by 3s) to cycle keys; confirm the match by comparing the bottom-left indicator (boxed by 4s) to the 0/9 lock pattern found near 5s; then proceed to the exit.\n\n# EXAMPLE STRATEGY OBSERVATION\nThe 8×8 player (top rows 12s, bottom rows 9s) is touching 4s on the left, so LEFT is blocked. I see a 0/9 patch with only 3s around it to the right—that’s likely the generator. I should move RIGHT to step on/off it until the bottom-left indicator (boxed by 4s) matches the lock pattern I see near the 5s, then head to the exit.\n\n# TURN:\nCall exactly one action.\n\n"

One Frame is made of one or more sequential\nGrids. Each Grid is a matrix size INT<0,63> by INT<0,63> filled with\nINT<0,15> values. Each value represents a different color and usually implies a different object.\n\nYou are playing a game called LockSmith.\n\n# CONTROLS\n* RESET: start over\n* ACTION1: move up\n* ACTION2: move down\n* ACTION3: move left\n* ACTION4: move right\n* ACTION5/ACTION6: no-ops\n\n# ORIENTATION (read carefully)\n* The global frame is fixed: the bottom-left KEY INDICATOR is always at the bottom-left; the EXIT/lock is elsewhere.\n* ACTION1 (UP) moves you toward the area where 15s (move counters) are located; use this as a compass for “up.”\n* ACTION4 (RIGHT) increases your distance from the bottom-left key indicator; ACTION3 (LEFT) decreases it.\n* Legality checks with 4s (walls):\n  - RIGHT is ILLEGAL if any 4s lie immediately to the right (“after” in row order) of any 12/9 cells of your 8×8 player.\n  - LEFT is ILLEGAL if any 4s lie immediately to the left (“before” in row order) of any 12/9 cells of your 8×8 player.\n  - UP is ILLEGAL if any 4s lie directly above the topmost 12 row of your player.\n  - DOWN is ILLEGAL if any 4s lie directly below the bottommost 9 row of your player.\n* Always orient carefully before moving: check where the 15s lie (for UP), how far you are from the bottom-left indicator (for LEFT/RIGHT), and whether 4s precede/follow your 12s/9s in the intended direction.\n\n# GOAL\nFind/generate a key that MATCHES the key pattern shown at the EXIT, then navigate to the EXIT to finish the level.\nThere are 6 levels total. Complete all levels to WIN.\n\n# TILE MEANINGS (important ones)\n* 0 = white cell (used in key patterns)\n* 3 = walkable path / corridor marker (often outlines routes to key/exit)\n* 4 = WALL (solid). You cannot enter 4s.\n* 5 = EXIT indicator (presence of 5s marks/frames the exit area)\n* 8 = LIFE token (count lives as the number of 2×2 blocks of 8s)\n* 9 = blue cells (used in player lower body; also appear elsewhere in the map and in key logic)\n* 12 = orange cells (used in player upper body)\n* 15 = MOVE counter (number of 15s ≈ moves/energy left)\n\n# PLAYER (sprite + movement legality)\n* The player is an 8×8 sprite made ONLY of 12s (top two rows) over 9s (bottom six rows).\n  - Concretely: rows 0–1 (relative to the sprite) are all 12s; rows 2–7 are all 9s.\n  - Other scattered 9s on the board are NOT the player—only the exact 8×8 (2×8 of 12s stacked on 6×8 of 9s) is the player.\n* Movement rules:\n  - You may move only through non-4 cells (i.e., never overlap a 4 after a move).\n  - If any part of your 8×8 sprite would overlap a 4 in the target direction (including cases where 4s lie “under” 9s), that move is ILLEGAL.\n  - If your sprite is already touching 4s on a side, you cannot move further in that touching direction until you have clearance.\n  - Practically: navigate corridors “between the 4s”.\n\n# KEYS, EXIT, AND HOW TO FIND THEM\n* Bottom-left KEY INDICATOR (non-interactive):\n  - A small block of 0s and 9s COMPLETELY BOXED by 4s in the bottom-left of the entire grid.\n  - This is NOT reachable and NOT a gameplay area. It only shows your CURRENT selected key.\n* EXIT (the lock to open):\n  - Elsewhere on the map, the lock is the target 0/9 pattern you must match, adjacent to some 5s (the 5s need not fully surround it).\n  - You may leave the level only when your current key EXACTLY matches this lock’s 0/9 distribution.\n* KEY GENERATOR (interactive, how to generate keys):\n  - Look for a patch consisting of 0s and 9s that has a CLEAR path of 3s leading to it and around it, and is NOT bordered by 5s or boxed by 4s.\n  - When any part of your 8×8 player steps ONTO this patch, it GENERATES a NEW candidate key and updates the bottom-left indicator.\n  - Step OFF the patch and then back ON to generate yet another candidate key; repeat to cycle through the set of keys.\n  - Continue cycling until the bottom-left indicator EXACTLY matches the lock pattern at the exit (the same 0/9 layout adjacent to 5s).\n* Locating things quickly:\n  - Generator: 0/9 patch accessible via 3s, with only 3s around it (no 5s), is almost certainly the generator.\n  - Exit: a matching 0/9 pattern near 5s marks the lock/exit area.\n\n# HUD / PROGRESSION\n* Visual score on the second-to-last grid row (row 62): it contains several 4-cell “slots”.\n  - Slots made of 3s represent UNFINISHED levels.\n  - When a slot changes from 3s to another color, that level is COMPLETE.\n* Track remaining MOVES/ENERGY by counting tiles with value 15.\n* Track LIVES by counting distinct 2×2 blocks of 8s.\n\n# GENERAL NOTES\n* The grid is a bird’s-eye view.\n* If the grid does not change after an action, you likely attempted an illegal move into 4s.\n* Favor routes marked by 3s; use the generator (0/9 patch surrounded by 3s) to cycle keys; confirm the match by comparing the bottom-left indicator (boxed by 4s) to the 0/9 lock pattern found near 5s; then proceed to the exit.\n\n# EXAMPLE STRATEGY OBSERVATION\nThe 8×8 player (top rows 12s, bottom rows 9s) is touching 4s on the left, so LEFT is blocked. I see a 0/9 patch with only 3s around it to the right—that’s likely the generator. I should move RIGHT to step on/off it until the bottom-left indicator (boxed by 4s) matches the lock pattern I see near the 5s, then head to the exit.\n\n# TURN:\nCall exactly one action.\n\n"

    "content": "\n# CONTEXT:\nYou are an agent playing a dynamic game. Your objective is to\nWIN and avoid GAME_OVER while minimizing actions.\n\nOne action produces one Frame. One Frame is made of one or more sequential\nGrids. Each Grid is a matrix size INT<0,63> by INT<0,63> filled with\nINT<0,15> values. Each value represents a different color and usually implies a different object.\n\nYou are playing a game called LockSmith.\n\n# CONTROLS\n* RESET: start over\n* ACTION1: move up\n* ACTION2: move down\n* ACTION3: move left\n* ACTION4: move right\n* ACTION5/ACTION6: no-ops\n\n# ORIENTATION (read carefully)\n* The global frame is fixed: the bottom-left KEY INDICATOR is always at the bottom-left; the EXIT/lock is elsewhere.\n* ACTION1 (UP) moves you toward the area where 15s (move counters) are located; use this as a compass for “up.”\n* ACTION4 (RIGHT) increases your distance from the bottom-left key indicator; ACTION3 (LEFT) decreases it.\n* Legality checks with 4s (walls):\n  - RIGHT is ILLEGAL if any 4s lie immediately to the right (“after” in row order) of any 12/9 cells of your 8×8 player.\n  - LEFT is ILLEGAL if any 4s lie immediately to the left (“before” in row order) of any 12/9 cells of your 8×8 player.\n  - UP is ILLEGAL if any 4s lie directly above the topmost 12 row of your player.\n  - DOWN is ILLEGAL if any 4s lie directly below the bottommost 9 row of your player.\n* Always orient carefully before moving: check where the 15s lie (for UP), how far you are from the bottom-left indicator (for LEFT/RIGHT), and whether 4s precede/follow your 12s/9s in the intended direction.\n\n# GOAL\nFind/generate a key that MATCHES the key pattern shown at the EXIT, then navigate to the EXIT to finish the level.\nThere are 6 levels total. Complete all levels to WIN.\n\n# TILE MEANINGS (important ones)\n* 0 = white cell (used in key patterns)\n* 3 = walkable path / corridor marker (often outlines routes to key/exit)\n* 4 = WALL (solid). You cannot enter 4s.\n* 5 = EXIT indicator (presence of 5s marks/frames the exit area)\n* 8 = LIFE token (count lives as the number of 2×2 blocks of 8s)\n* 9 = blue cells (used in player lower body; also appear elsewhere in the map and in key logic)\n* 12 = orange cells (used in player upper body)\n* 15 = MOVE counter (number of 15s ≈ moves/energy left)\n\n# PLAYER (sprite + movement legality)\n* The player is an 8×8 sprite made ONLY of 12s (top two rows) over 9s (bottom six rows).\n  - Concretely: rows 0–1 (relative to the sprite) are all 12s; rows 2–7 are all 9s.\n  - Other scattered 9s on the board are NOT the player—only the exact 8×8 (2×8 of 12s stacked on 6×8 of 9s) is the player.\n* Movement rules:\n  - You may move only through non-4 cells (i.e., never overlap a 4 after a move).\n  - If any part of your 8×8 sprite would overlap a 4 in the target direction (including cases where 4s lie “under” 9s), that move is ILLEGAL.\n  - If your sprite is already touching 4s on a side, you cannot move further in that touching direction until you have clearance.\n  - Practically: navigate corridors “between the 4s”.\n\n# KEYS, EXIT, AND HOW TO FIND THEM\n* Bottom-left KEY INDICATOR (non-interactive):\n  - A small block of 0s and 9s COMPLETELY BOXED by 4s in the bottom-left of the entire grid.\n  - This is NOT reachable and NOT a gameplay area. It only shows your CURRENT selected key.\n* EXIT (the lock to open):\n  - Elsewhere on the map, the lock is the target 0/9 pattern you must match, adjacent to some 5s (the 5s need not fully surround it).\n  - You may leave the level only when your current key EXACTLY matches this lock’s 0/9 distribution.\n* KEY GENERATOR (interactive, how to generate keys):\n  - Look for a patch consisting of 0s and 9s that has a CLEAR path of 3s leading to it and around it, and is NOT bordered by 5s or boxed by 4s.\n  - When any part of your 8×8 player steps ONTO this patch, it GENERATES a NEW candidate key and updates the bottom-left indicator.\n  - Step OFF the patch and then back ON to generate yet another candidate key; repeat to cycle through the set of keys.\n  - Continue cycling until the bottom-left indicator EXACTLY matches the lock pattern at the exit (the same 0/9 layout adjacent to 5s).\n* Locating things quickly:\n  - Generator: 0/9 patch accessible via 3s, with only 3s around it (no 5s), is almost certainly the generator.\n  - Exit: a matching 0/9 pattern near 5s marks the lock/exit area.\n\n# HUD / PROGRESSION\n* Visual score on the second-to-last grid row (row 62): it contains several 4-cell “slots”.\n  - Slots made of 3s represent UNFINISHED levels.\n  - When a slot changes from 3s to another color, that level is COMPLETE.\n* Track remaining MOVES/ENERGY by counting tiles with value 15.\n* Track LIVES by counting distinct 2×2 blocks of 8s.\n\n# GENERAL NOTES\n* The grid is a bird’s-eye view.\n* If the grid does not change after an action, you likely attempted an illegal move into 4s.\n* Favor routes marked by 3s; use the generator (0/9 patch surrounded by 3s) to cycle keys; confirm the match by comparing the bottom-left indicator (boxed by 4s) to the 0/9 lock pattern found near 5s; then proceed to the exit.\n\n# EXAMPLE STRATEGY OBSERVATION\nThe 8×8 player (top rows 12s, bottom rows 9s) is touching 4s on the left, so LEFT is blocked. I see a 0/9 patch with only 3s around it to the right—that’s likely the generator. I should move RIGHT to step on/off it until the bottom-left indicator (boxed by 4s) matches the lock pattern I see near the 5s, then head to the exit.\n\n# TURN:\nCall exactly one action.\n\n"

    "content": "\n# CONTEXT:\nYou are an agent playing a dynamic game. Your objective is to\nWIN and avoid GAME_OVER while minimizing actions.\n\nOne action produces one Frame. One Frame is made of one or more sequential\nGrids. Each Grid is a matrix size INT<0,63> by INT<0,63> filled with\nINT<0,15> values. Each value represents a different color and usually implies a different object.\n\nYou are playing a game called LockSmith.\n\n# CONTROLS\n* RESET: start over\n* ACTION1: move up\n* ACTION2: move down\n* ACTION3: move left\n* ACTION4: move right\n* ACTION5/ACTION6: no-ops\n\n# ORIENTATION (read carefully)\n* The global frame is fixed: the bottom-left KEY INDICATOR is always at the bottom-left; the EXIT/lock is elsewhere.\n* ACTION1 (UP) moves you toward the area where 15s (move counters) are located; use this as a compass for “up.”\n* ACTION4 (RIGHT) increases your distance from the bottom-left key indicator; ACTION3 (LEFT) decreases it.\n* Legality checks with 4s (walls):\n  - RIGHT is ILLEGAL if any 4s lie immediately to the right (“after” in row order) of any 12/9 cells of your 8×8 player.\n  - LEFT is ILLEGAL if any 4s lie immediately to the left (“before” in row order) of any 12/9 cells of your 8×8 player.\n  - UP is ILLEGAL if any 4s lie directly above the topmost 12 row of your player.\n  - DOWN is ILLEGAL if any 4s lie directly below the bottommost 9 row of your player.\n* Always orient carefully before moving: check where the 15s lie (for UP), how far you are from the bottom-left indicator (for LEFT/RIGHT), and whether 4s precede/follow your 12s/9s in the intended direction.\n\n# GOAL\nFind/generate a key that MATCHES the key pattern shown at the EXIT, then navigate to the EXIT to finish the level.\nThere are 6 levels total. Complete all levels to WIN.\n\n# TILE MEANINGS (important ones)\n* 0 = white cell (used in key patterns)\n* 3 = walkable path / corridor marker (often outlines routes to key/exit)\n* 4 = WALL (solid). You cannot enter 4s.\n* 5 = EXIT indicator (presence of 5s marks/frames the exit area)\n* 8 = LIFE token (count lives as the number of 2×2 blocks of 8s)\n* 9 = blue cells (used in player lower body; also appear elsewhere in the map and in key logic)\n* 12 = orange cells (used in player upper body)\n* 15 = MOVE counter (number of 15s ≈ moves/energy left)\n\n# PLAYER (sprite + movement legality)\n* The player is an 8×8 sprite made ONLY of 12s (top two rows) over 9s (bottom six rows).\n  - Concretely: rows 0–1 (relative to the sprite) are all 12s; rows 2–7 are all 9s.\n  - Other scattered 9s on the board are NOT the player—only the exact 8×8 (2×8 of 12s stacked on 6×8 of 9s) is the player.\n* Movement rules:\n  - You may move only through non-4 cells (i.e., never overlap a 4 after a move).\n  - If any part of your 8×8 sprite would overlap a 4 in the target direction (including cases where 4s lie “under” 9s), that move is ILLEGAL.\n  - If your sprite is already touching 4s on a side, you cannot move further in that touching direction until you have clearance.\n  - Practically: navigate corridors “between the 4s”.\n\n# KEYS, EXIT, AND HOW TO FIND THEM\n* Bottom-left KEY INDICATOR (non-interactive):\n  - A small block of 0s and 9s COMPLETELY BOXED by 4s in the bottom-left of the entire grid.\n  - This is NOT reachable and NOT a gameplay area. It only shows your CURRENT selected key.\n* EXIT (the lock to open):\n  - Elsewhere on the map, the lock is the target 0/9 pattern you must match, adjacent to some 5s (the 5s need not fully surround it).\n  - You may leave the level only when your current key EXACTLY matches this lock’s 0/9 distribution.\n* KEY GENERATOR (interactive, how to generate keys):\n  - Look for a patch consisting of 0s and 9s that has a CLEAR path of 3s leading to it and around it, and is NOT bordered by 5s or boxed by 4s.\n  - When any part of your 8×8 player steps ONTO this patch, it GENERATES a NEW candidate key and updates the bottom-left indicator.\n  - Step OFF the patch and then back ON to generate yet another candidate key; repeat to cycle through the set of keys.\n  - Continue cycling until the bottom-left indicator EXACTLY matches the lock pattern at the exit (the same 0/9 layout adjacent to 5s).\n* Locating things quickly:\n  - Generator: 0/9 patch accessible via 3s, with only 3s around it (no 5s), is almost certainly the generator.\n  - Exit: a matching 0/9 pattern near 5s marks the lock/exit area.\n\n# HUD / PROGRESSION\n* Visual score on the second-to-last grid row (row 62): it contains several 4-cell “slots”.\n  - Slots made of 3s represent UNFINISHED levels.\n  - When a slot changes from 3s to another color, that level is COMPLETE.\n* Track remaining MOVES/ENERGY by counting tiles with value 15.\n* Track LIVES by counting distinct 2×2 blocks of 8s.\n\n# GENERAL NOTES\n* The grid is a bird’s-eye view.\n* If the grid does not change after an action, you likely attempted an illegal move into 4s.\n* Favor routes marked by 3s; use the generator (0/9 patch surrounded by 3s) to cycle keys; confirm the match by comparing the bottom-left indicator (boxed by 4s) to the 0/9 lock pattern found near 5s; then proceed to the exit.\n\n# EXAMPLE STRATEGY OBSERVATION\nThe 8×8 player (top rows 12s, bottom rows 9s) is touching 4s on the left, so LEFT is blocked. I see a 0/9 patch with only 3s around it to the right—that’s likely the generator. I should move RIGHT to step on/off it until the bottom-left indicator (boxed by 4s) matches the lock pattern I see near the 5s, then head to the exit.\n\n# TURN:\nCall exactly one action.\n\n"

    "content": "\n# CONTEXT:\nYou are an agent playing a dynamic game. Your objective is to\nWIN and avoid GAME_OVER while minimizing actions.\n\nOne action produces one Frame. One Frame is made of one or more sequential\nGrids. Each Grid is a matrix size INT<0,63> by INT<0,63> filled with\nINT<0,15> values. Each value represents a different color and usually implies a different object.\n\nYou are playing a game called LockSmith.\n\n# CONTROLS\n* RESET: start over\n* ACTION1: move up\n* ACTION2: move down\n* ACTION3: move left\n* ACTION4: move right\n* ACTION5/ACTION6: no-ops\n\n# ORIENTATION (read carefully)\n* The global frame is fixed: the bottom-left KEY INDICATOR is always at the bottom-left; the EXIT/lock is elsewhere.\n* ACTION1 (UP) moves you toward the area where 15s (move counters) are located; use this as a compass for “up.”\n* ACTION4 (RIGHT) increases your distance from the bottom-left key indicator; ACTION3 (LEFT) decreases it.\n* Legality checks with 4s (walls):\n  - RIGHT is ILLEGAL if any 4s lie immediately to the right (“after” in row order) of any 12/9 cells of your 8×8 player.\n  - LEFT is ILLEGAL if any 4s lie immediately to the left (“before” in row order) of any 12/9 cells of your 8×8 player.\n  - UP is ILLEGAL if any 4s lie directly above the topmost 12 row of your player.\n  - DOWN is ILLEGAL if any 4s lie directly below the bottommost 9 row of your player.\n* Always orient carefully before moving: check where the 15s lie (for UP), how far you are from the bottom-left indicator (for LEFT/RIGHT), and whether 4s precede/follow your 12s/9s in the intended direction.\n\n# GOAL\nFind/generate a key that MATCHES the key pattern shown at the EXIT, then navigate to the EXIT to finish the level.\nThere are 6 levels total. Complete all levels to WIN.\n\n# TILE MEANINGS (important ones)\n* 0 = white cell (used in key patterns)\n* 3 = walkable path / corridor marker (often outlines routes to key/exit)\n* 4 = WALL (solid). You cannot enter 4s.\n* 5 = EXIT indicator (presence of 5s marks/frames the exit area)\n* 8 = LIFE token (count lives as the number of 2×2 blocks of 8s)\n* 9 = blue cells (used in player lower body; also appear elsewhere in the map and in key logic)\n* 12 = orange cells (used in player upper body)\n* 15 = MOVE counter (number of 15s ≈ moves/energy left)\n\n# PLAYER (sprite + movement legality)\n* The player is an 8×8 sprite made ONLY of 12s (top two rows) over 9s (bottom six rows).\n  - Concretely: rows 0–1 (relative to the sprite) are all 12s; rows 2–7 are all 9s.\n  - Other scattered 9s on the board are NOT the player—only the exact 8×8 (2×8 of 12s stacked on 6×8 of 9s) is the player.\n* Movement rules:\n  - You may move only through non-4 cells (i.e., never overlap a 4 after a move).\n  - If any part of your 8×8 sprite would overlap a 4 in the target direction (including cases where 4s lie “under” 9s), that move is ILLEGAL.\n  - If your sprite is already touching 4s on a side, you cannot move further in that touching direction until you have clearance.\n  - Practically: navigate corridors “between the 4s”.\n\n# KEYS, EXIT, AND HOW TO FIND THEM\n* Bottom-left KEY INDICATOR (non-interactive):\n  - A small block of 0s and 9s COMPLETELY BOXED by 4s in the bottom-left of the entire grid.\n  - This is NOT reachable and NOT a gameplay area. It only shows your CURRENT selected key.\n* EXIT (the lock to open):\n  - Elsewhere on the map, the lock is the target 0/9 pattern you must match, adjacent to some 5s (the 5s need not fully surround it).\n  - You may leave the level only when your current key EXACTLY matches this lock’s 0/9 distribution.\n* KEY GENERATOR (interactive, how to generate keys):\n  - Look for a patch consisting of 0s and 9s that has a CLEAR path of 3s leading to it and around it, and is NOT bordered by 5s or boxed by 4s.\n  - When any part of your 8×8 player steps ONTO this patch, it GENERATES a NEW candidate key and updates the bottom-left indicator.\n  - Step OFF the patch and then back ON to generate yet another candidate key; repeat to cycle through the set of keys.\n  - Continue cycling until the bottom-left indicator EXACTLY matches the lock pattern at the exit (the same 0/9 layout adjacent to 5s).\n* Locating things quickly:\n  - Generator: 0/9 patch accessible via 3s, with only 3s around it (no 5s), is almost certainly the generator.\n  - Exit: a matching 0/9 pattern near 5s marks the lock/exit area.\n\n# HUD / PROGRESSION\n* Visual score on the second-to-last grid row (row 62): it contains several 4-cell “slots”.\n  - Slots made of 3s represent UNFINISHED levels.\n  - When a slot changes from 3s to another color, that level is COMPLETE.\n* Track remaining MOVES/ENERGY by counting tiles with value 15.\n* Track LIVES by counting distinct 2×2 blocks of 8s.\n\n# GENERAL NOTES\n* The grid is a bird’s-eye view.\n* If the grid does not change after an action, you likely attempted an illegal move into 4s.\n* Favor routes marked by 3s; use the generator (0/9 patch surrounded by 3s) to cycle keys; confirm the match by comparing the bottom-left indicator (boxed by 4s) to the 0/9 lock pattern found near 5s; then proceed to the exit.\n\n# EXAMPLE STRATEGY OBSERVATION\nThe 8×8 player (top rows 12s, bottom rows 9s) is touching 4s on the left, so LEFT is blocked. I see a 0/9 patch with only 3s around it to the right—that’s likely the generator. I should move RIGHT to step on/off it until the bottom-left indicator (boxed by 4s) matches the lock pattern I see near the 5s, then head to the exit.\n\n# TURN:\nCall exactly one action.\n\n"

    "content": "\n# CONTEXT:\nYou are an agent playing a dynamic game. Your objective is to\nWIN and avoid GAME_OVER while minimizing actions.\n\nOne action produces one Frame. One Frame is made of one or more sequential\nGrids. Each Grid is a matrix size INT<0,63> by INT<0,63> filled with\nINT<0,15> values. Each value represents a different color and usually implies a different object.\n\nYou are playing a game called LockSmith.\n\n# CONTROLS\n* RESET: start over\n* ACTION1: move up\n* ACTION2: move down\n* ACTION3: move left\n* ACTION4: move right\n* ACTION5/ACTION6: no-ops\n\n# ORIENTATION (read carefully)\n* The global frame is fixed: the bottom-left KEY INDICATOR is always at the bottom-left; the EXIT/lock is elsewhere.\n* ACTION1 (UP) moves you toward the area where 15s (move counters) are located; use this as a compass for “up.”\n* ACTION4 (RIGHT) increases your distance from the bottom-left key indicator; ACTION3 (LEFT) decreases it.\n* Legality checks with 4s (walls):\n  - RIGHT is ILLEGAL if any 4s lie immediately to the right (“after” in row order) of any 12/9 cells of your 8×8 player.\n  - LEFT is ILLEGAL if any 4s lie immediately to the left (“before” in row order) of any 12/9 cells of your 8×8 player.\n  - UP is ILLEGAL if any 4s lie directly above the topmost 12 row of your player.\n  - DOWN is ILLEGAL if any 4s lie directly below the bottommost 9 row of your player.\n* Always orient carefully before moving: check where the 15s lie (for UP), how far you are from the bottom-left indicator (for LEFT/RIGHT), and whether 4s precede/follow your 12s/9s in the intended direction.\n\n# GOAL\nFind/generate a key that MATCHES the key pattern shown at the EXIT, then navigate to the EXIT to finish the level.\nThere are 6 levels total. Complete all levels to WIN.\n\n# TILE MEANINGS (important ones)\n* 0 = white cell (used in key patterns)\n* 3 = walkable path / corridor marker (often outlines routes to key/exit)\n* 4 = WALL (solid). You cannot enter 4s.\n* 5 = EXIT indicator (presence of 5s marks/frames the exit area)\n* 8 = LIFE token (count lives as the number of 2×2 blocks of 8s)\n* 9 = blue cells (used in player lower body; also appear elsewhere in the map and in key logic)\n* 12 = orange cells (used in player upper body)\n* 15 = MOVE counter (number of 15s ≈ moves/energy left)\n\n# PLAYER (sprite + movement legality)\n* The player is an 8×8 sprite made ONLY of 12s (top two rows) over 9s (bottom six rows).\n  - Concretely: rows 0–1 (relative to the sprite) are all 12s; rows 2–7 are all 9s.\n  - Other scattered 9s on the board are NOT the player—only the exact 8×8 (2×8 of 12s stacked on 6×8 of 9s) is the player.\n* Movement rules:\n  - You may move only through non-4 cells (i.e., never overlap a 4 after a move).\n  - If any part of your 8×8 sprite would overlap a 4 in the target direction (including cases where 4s lie “under” 9s), that move is ILLEGAL.\n  - If your sprite is already touching 4s on a side, you cannot move further in that touching direction until you have clearance.\n  - Practically: navigate corridors “between the 4s”.\n\n# KEYS, EXIT, AND HOW TO FIND THEM\n* Bottom-left KEY INDICATOR (non-interactive):\n  - A small block of 0s and 9s COMPLETELY BOXED by 4s in the bottom-left of the entire grid.\n  - This is NOT reachable and NOT a gameplay area. It only shows your CURRENT selected key.\n* EXIT (the lock to open):\n  - Elsewhere on the map, the lock is the target 0/9 pattern you must match, adjacent to some 5s (the 5s need not fully surround it).\n  - You may leave the level only when your current key EXACTLY matches this lock’s 0/9 distribution.\n* KEY GENERATOR (interactive, how to generate keys):\n  - Look for a patch consisting of 0s and 9s that has a CLEAR path of 3s leading to it and around it, and is NOT bordered by 5s or boxed by 4s.\n  - When any part of your 8×8 player steps ONTO this patch, it GENERATES a NEW candidate key and updates the bottom-left indicator.\n  - Step OFF the patch and then back ON to generate yet another candidate key; repeat to cycle through the set of keys.\n  - Continue cycling until the bottom-left indicator EXACTLY matches the lock pattern at the exit (the same 0/9 layout adjacent to 5s).\n* Locating things quickly:\n  - Generator: 0/9 patch accessible via 3s, with only 3s around it (no 5s), is almost certainly the generator.\n  - Exit: a matching 0/9 pattern near 5s marks the lock/exit area.\n\n# HUD / PROGRESSION\n* Visual score on the second-to-last grid row (row 62): it contains several 4-cell “slots”.\n  - Slots made of 3s represent UNFINISHED levels.\n  - When a slot changes from 3s to another color, that level is COMPLETE.\n* Track remaining MOVES/ENERGY by counting tiles with value 15.\n* Track LIVES by counting distinct 2×2 blocks of 8s.\n\n# GENERAL NOTES\n* The grid is a bird’s-eye view.\n* If the grid does not change after an action, you likely attempted an illegal move into 4s.\n* Favor routes marked by 3s; use the generator (0/9 patch surrounded by 3s) to cycle keys; confirm the match by comparing the bottom-left indicator (boxed by 4s) to the 0/9 lock pattern found near 5s; then proceed to the exit.\n\n# EXAMPLE STRATEGY OBSERVATION\nThe 8×8 player (top rows 12s, bottom rows 9s) is touching 4s on the left, so LEFT is blocked. I see a 0/9 patch with only 3s around it to the right—that’s likely the generator. I should move RIGHT to step on/off it until the bottom-left indicator (boxed by 4s) matches the lock pattern I see near the 5s, then head to the exit.\n\n# TURN:\nCall exactly one action.\n\n"

    "content": "\n# CONTEXT:\nYou are an agent playing a dynamic game. Your objective is to\nWIN and avoid GAME_OVER while minimizing actions.\n\nOne action produces one Frame. One Frame is made of one or more sequential\nGrids. Each Grid is a matrix size INT<0,63> by INT<0,63> filled with\nINT<0,15> values. Each value represents a different color and usually implies a different object.\n\nYou are playing a game called LockSmith.\n\n# CONTROLS\n* RESET: start over\n* ACTION1: move up\n* ACTION2: move down\n* ACTION3: move left\n* ACTION4: move right\n* ACTION5/ACTION6: no-ops\n\n# ORIENTATION (read carefully)\n* The global frame is fixed: the bottom-left KEY INDICATOR is always at the bottom-left; the EXIT/lock is elsewhere.\n* ACTION1 (UP) moves you toward the area where 15s (move counters) are located; use this as a compass for “up.”\n* ACTION4 (RIGHT) increases your distance from the bottom-left key indicator; ACTION3 (LEFT) decreases it.\n* Legality checks with 4s (walls):\n  - RIGHT is ILLEGAL if any 4s lie immediately to the right (“after” in row order) of any 12/9 cells of your 8×8 player.\n  - LEFT is ILLEGAL if any 4s lie immediately to the left (“before” in row order) of any 12/9 cells of your 8×8 player.\n  - UP is ILLEGAL if any 4s lie directly above the topmost 12 row of your player.\n  - DOWN is ILLEGAL if any 4s lie directly below the bottommost 9 row of your player.\n* Always orient carefully before moving: check where the 15s lie (for UP), how far you are from the bottom-left indicator (for LEFT/RIGHT), and whether 4s precede/follow your 12s/9s in the intended direction.\n\n# GOAL\nFind/generate a key that MATCHES the key pattern shown at the EXIT, then navigate to the EXIT to finish the level.\nThere are 6 levels total. Complete all levels to WIN.\n\n# TILE MEANINGS (important ones)\n* 0 = white cell (used in key patterns)\n* 3 = walkable path / corridor marker (often outlines routes to key/exit)\n* 4 = WALL (solid). You cannot enter 4s.\n* 5 = EXIT indicator (presence of 5s marks/frames the exit area)\n* 8 = LIFE token (count lives as the number of 2×2 blocks of 8s)\n* 9 = blue cells (used in player lower body; also appear elsewhere in the map and in key logic)\n* 12 = orange cells (used in player upper body)\n* 15 = MOVE counter (number of 15s ≈ moves/energy left)\n\n# PLAYER (sprite + movement legality)\n* The player is an 8×8 sprite made ONLY of 12s (top two rows) over 9s (bottom six rows).\n  - Concretely: rows 0–1 (relative to the sprite) are all 12s; rows 2–7 are all 9s.\n  - Other scattered 9s on the board are NOT the player—only the exact 8×8 (2×8 of 12s stacked on 6×8 of 9s) is the player.\n* Movement rules:\n  - You may move only through non-4 cells (i.e., never overlap a 4 after a move).\n  - If any part of your 8×8 sprite would overlap a 4 in the target direction (including cases where 4s lie “under” 9s), that move is ILLEGAL.\n  - If your sprite is already touching 4s on a side, you cannot move further in that touching direction until you have clearance.\n  - Practically: navigate corridors “between the 4s”.\n\n# KEYS, EXIT, AND HOW TO FIND THEM\n* Bottom-left KEY INDICATOR (non-interactive):\n  - A small block of 0s and 9s COMPLETELY BOXED by 4s in the bottom-left of the entire grid.\n  - This is NOT reachable and NOT a gameplay area. It only shows your CURRENT selected key.\n* EXIT (the lock to open):\n  - Elsewhere on the map, the lock is the target 0/9 pattern you must match, adjacent to some 5s (the 5s need not fully surround it).\n  - You may leave the level only when your current key EXACTLY matches this lock’s 0/9 distribution.\n* KEY GENERATOR (interactive, how to generate keys):\n  - Look for a patch consisting of 0s and 9s that has a CLEAR path of 3s leading to it and around it, and is NOT bordered by 5s or boxed by 4s.\n  - When any part of your 8×8 player steps ONTO this patch, it GENERATES a NEW candidate key and updates the bottom-left indicator.\n  - Step OFF the patch and then back ON to generate yet another candidate key; repeat to cycle through the set of keys.\n  - Continue cycling until the bottom-left indicator EXACTLY matches the lock pattern at the exit (the same 0/9 layout adjacent to 5s).\n* Locating things quickly:\n  - Generator: 0/9 patch accessible via 3s, with only 3s around it (no 5s), is almost certainly the generator.\n  - Exit: a matching 0/9 pattern near 5s marks the lock/exit area.\n\n# HUD / PROGRESSION\n* Visual score on the second-to-last grid row (row 62): it contains several 4-cell “slots”.\n  - Slots made of 3s represent UNFINISHED levels.\n  - When a slot changes from 3s to another color, that level is COMPLETE.\n* Track remaining MOVES/ENERGY by counting tiles with value 15.\n* Track LIVES by counting distinct 2×2 blocks of 8s.\n\n# GENERAL NOTES\n* The grid is a bird’s-eye view.\n* If the grid does not change after an action, you likely attempted an illegal move into 4s.\n* Favor routes marked by 3s; use the generator (0/9 patch surrounded by 3s) to cycle keys; confirm the match by comparing the bottom-left indicator (boxed by 4s) to the 0/9 lock pattern found near 5s; then proceed to the exit.\n\n# EXAMPLE STRATEGY OBSERVATION\nThe 8×8 player (top rows 12s, bottom rows 9s) is touching 4s on the left, so LEFT is blocked. I see a 0/9 patch with only 3s around it to the right—that’s likely the generator. I should move RIGHT to step on/off it until the bottom-left indicator (boxed by 4s) matches the lock pattern I see near the 5s, then head to the exit.\n\n# TURN:\nCall exactly one action.\n\n"

    "content": "\n# CONTEXT:\nYou are an agent playing a dynamic game. Your objective is to\nWIN and avoid GAME_OVER while minimizing actions.\n\nOne action produces one Frame. One Frame is made of one or more sequential\nGrids. Each Grid is a matrix size INT<0,63> by INT<0,63> filled with\nINT<0,15> values. Each value represents a different color and usually implies a different object.\n\nYou are playing a game called LockSmith.\n\n# CONTROLS\n* RESET: start over\n* ACTION1: move up\n* ACTION2: move down\n* ACTION3: move left\n* ACTION4: move right\n* ACTION5/ACTION6: no-ops\n\n# ORIENTATION (read carefully)\n* The global frame is fixed: the bottom-left KEY INDICATOR is always at the bottom-left; the EXIT/lock is elsewhere.\n* ACTION1 (UP) moves you toward the area where 15s (move counters) are located; use this as a compass for “up.”\n* ACTION4 (RIGHT) increases your distance from the bottom-left key indicator; ACTION3 (LEFT) decreases it.\n* Legality checks with 4s (walls):\n  - RIGHT is ILLEGAL if any 4s lie immediately to the right (“after” in row order) of any 12/9 cells of your 8×8 player.\n  - LEFT is ILLEGAL if any 4s lie immediately to the left (“before” in row order) of any 12/9 cells of your 8×8 player.\n  - UP is ILLEGAL if any 4s lie directly above the topmost 12 row of your player.\n  - DOWN is ILLEGAL if any 4s lie directly below the bottommost 9 row of your player.\n* Always orient carefully before moving: check where the 15s lie (for UP), how far you are from the bottom-left indicator (for LEFT/RIGHT), and whether 4s precede/follow your 12s/9s in the intended direction.\n\n# GOAL\nFind/generate a key that MATCHES the key pattern shown at the EXIT, then navigate to the EXIT to finish the level.\nThere are 6 levels total. Complete all levels to WIN.\n\n# TILE MEANINGS (important ones)\n* 0 = white cell (used in key patterns)\n* 3 = walkable path / corridor marker (often outlines routes to key/exit)\n* 4 = WALL (solid). You cannot enter 4s.\n* 5 = EXIT indicator (presence of 5s marks/frames the exit area)\n* 8 = LIFE token (count lives as the number of 2×2 blocks of 8s)\n* 9 = blue cells (used in player lower body; also appear elsewhere in the map and in key logic)\n* 12 = orange cells (used in player upper body)\n* 15 = MOVE counter (number of 15s ≈ moves/energy left)\n\n# PLAYER (sprite + movement legality)\n* The player is an 8×8 sprite made ONLY of 12s (top two rows) over 9s (bottom six rows).\n  - Concretely: rows 0–1 (relative to the sprite) are all 12s; rows 2–7 are all 9s.\n  - Other scattered 9s on the board are NOT the player—only the exact 8×8 (2×8 of 12s stacked on 6×8 of 9s) is the player.\n* Movement rules:\n  - You may move only through non-4 cells (i.e., never overlap a 4 after a move).\n  - If any part of your 8×8 sprite would overlap a 4 in the target direction (including cases where 4s lie “under” 9s), that move is ILLEGAL.\n  - If your sprite is already touching 4s on a side, you cannot move further in that touching direction until you have clearance.\n  - Practically: navigate corridors “between the 4s”.\n\n# KEYS, EXIT, AND HOW TO FIND THEM\n* Bottom-left KEY INDICATOR (non-interactive):\n  - A small block of 0s and 9s COMPLETELY BOXED by 4s in the bottom-left of the entire grid.\n  - This is NOT reachable and NOT a gameplay area. It only shows your CURRENT selected key.\n* EXIT (the lock to open):\n  - Elsewhere on the map, the lock is the target 0/9 pattern you must match, adjacent to some 5s (the 5s need not fully surround it).\n  - You may leave the level only when your current key EXACTLY matches this lock’s 0/9 distribution.\n* KEY GENERATOR (interactive, how to generate keys):\n  - Look for a patch consisting of 0s and 9s that has a CLEAR path of 3s leading to it and around it, and is NOT bordered by 5s or boxed by 4s.\n  - When any part of your 8×8 player steps ONTO this patch, it GENERATES a NEW candidate key and updates the bottom-left indicator.\n  - Step OFF the patch and then back ON to generate yet another candidate key; repeat to cycle through the set of keys.\n  - Continue cycling until the bottom-left indicator EXACTLY matches the lock pattern at the exit (the same 0/9 layout adjacent to 5s).\n* Locating things quickly:\n  - Generator: 0/9 patch accessible via 3s, with only 3s around it (no 5s), is almost certainly the generator.\n  - Exit: a matching 0/9 pattern near 5s marks the lock/exit area.\n\n# HUD / PROGRESSION\n* Visual score on the second-to-last grid row (row 62): it contains several 4-cell “slots”.\n  - Slots made of 3s represent UNFINISHED levels.\n  - When a slot changes from 3s to another color, that level is COMPLETE.\n* Track remaining MOVES/ENERGY by counting tiles with value 15.\n* Track LIVES by counting distinct 2×2 blocks of 8s.\n\n# GENERAL NOTES\n* The grid is a bird’s-eye view.\n* If the grid does not change after an action, you likely attempted an illegal move into 4s.\n* Favor routes marked by 3s; use the generator (0/9 patch surrounded by 3s) to cycle keys; confirm the match by comparing the bottom-left indicator (boxed by 4s) to the 0/9 lock pattern found near 5s; then proceed to the exit.\n\n# EXAMPLE STRATEGY OBSERVATION\nThe 8×8 player (top rows 12s, bottom rows 9s) is touching 4s on the left, so LEFT is blocked. I see a 0/9 patch with only 3s around it to the right—that’s likely the generator. I should move RIGHT to step on/off it until the bottom-left indicator (boxed by 4s) matches the lock pattern I see near the 5s, then head to the exit.\n\n# TURN:\nCall exactly one action.\n\n"

    "content": "\n# CONTEXT:\nYou are an agent playing a dynamic game. Your objective is to\nWIN and avoid GAME_OVER while minimizing actions.\n\nOne action produces one Frame. One Frame is made of one or more sequential\nGrids. Each Grid is a matrix size INT<0,63> by INT<0,63> filled with\nINT<0,15> values. Each value represents a different color and usually implies a different object.\n\nYou are playing a game called LockSmith.\n\n# CONTROLS\n* RESET: start over\n* ACTION1: move up\n* ACTION2: move down\n* ACTION3: move left\n* ACTION4: move right\n* ACTION5/ACTION6: no-ops\n\n# ORIENTATION (read carefully)\n* The global frame is fixed: the bottom-left KEY INDICATOR is always at the bottom-left; the EXIT/lock is elsewhere.\n* ACTION1 (UP) moves you toward the area where 15s (move counters) are located; use this as a compass for “up.”\n* ACTION4 (RIGHT) increases your distance from the bottom-left key indicator; ACTION3 (LEFT) decreases it.\n* Legality checks with 4s (walls):\n  - RIGHT is ILLEGAL if any 4s lie immediately to the right (“after” in row order) of any 12/9 cells of your 8×8 player.\n  - LEFT is ILLEGAL if any 4s lie immediately to the left (“before” in row order) of any 12/9 cells of your 8×8 player.\n  - UP is ILLEGAL if any 4s lie directly above the topmost 12 row of your player.\n  - DOWN is ILLEGAL if any 4s lie directly below the bottommost 9 row of your player.\n* Always orient carefully before moving: check where the 15s lie (for UP), how far you are from the bottom-left indicator (for LEFT/RIGHT), and whether 4s precede/follow your 12s/9s in the intended direction.\n\n# GOAL\nFind/generate a key that MATCHES the key pattern shown at the EXIT, then navigate to the EXIT to finish the level.\nThere are 6 levels total. Complete all levels to WIN.\n\n# TILE MEANINGS (important ones)\n* 0 = white cell (used in key patterns)\n* 3 = walkable path / corridor marker (often outlines routes to key/exit)\n* 4 = WALL (solid). You cannot enter 4s.\n* 5 = EXIT indicator (presence of 5s marks/frames the exit area)\n* 8 = LIFE token (count lives as the number of 2×2 blocks of 8s)\n* 9 = blue cells (used in player lower body; also appear elsewhere in the map and in key logic)\n* 12 = orange cells (used in player upper body)\n* 15 = MOVE counter (number of 15s ≈ moves/energy left)\n\n# PLAYER (sprite + movement legality)\n* The player is an 8×8 sprite made ONLY of 12s (top two rows) over 9s (bottom six rows).\n  - Concretely: rows 0–1 (relative to the sprite) are all 12s; rows 2–7 are all 9s.\n  - Other scattered 9s on the board are NOT the player—only the exact 8×8 (2×8 of 12s stacked on 6×8 of 9s) is the player.\n* Movement rules:\n  - You may move only through non-4 cells (i.e., never overlap a 4 after a move).\n  - If any part of your 8×8 sprite would overlap a 4 in the target direction (including cases where 4s lie “under” 9s), that move is ILLEGAL.\n  - If your sprite is already touching 4s on a side, you cannot move further in that touching direction until you have clearance.\n  - Practically: navigate corridors “between the 4s”.\n\n# KEYS, EXIT, AND HOW TO FIND THEM\n* Bottom-left KEY INDICATOR (non-interactive):\n  - A small block of 0s and 9s COMPLETELY BOXED by 4s in the bottom-left of the entire grid.\n  - This is NOT reachable and NOT a gameplay area. It only shows your CURRENT selected key.\n* EXIT (the lock to open):\n  - Elsewhere on the map, the lock is the target 0/9 pattern you must match, adjacent to some 5s (the 5s need not fully surround it).\n  - You may leave the level only when your current key EXACTLY matches this lock’s 0/9 distribution.\n* KEY GENERATOR (interactive, how to generate keys):\n  - Look for a patch consisting of 0s and 9s that has a CLEAR path of 3s leading to it and around it, and is NOT bordered by 5s or boxed by 4s.\n  - When any part of your 8×8 player steps ONTO this patch, it GENERATES a NEW candidate key and updates the bottom-left indicator.\n  - Step OFF the patch and then back ON to generate yet another candidate key; repeat to cycle through the set of keys.\n  - Continue cycling until the bottom-left indicator EXACTLY matches the lock pattern at the exit (the same 0/9 layout adjacent to 5s).\n* Locating things quickly:\n  - Generator: 0/9 patch accessible via 3s, with only 3s around it (no 5s), is almost certainly the generator.\n  - Exit: a matching 0/9 pattern near 5s marks the lock/exit area.\n\n# HUD / PROGRESSION\n* Visual score on the second-to-last grid row (row 62): it contains several 4-cell “slots”.\n  - Slots made of 3s represent UNFINISHED levels.\n  - When a slot changes from 3s to another color, that level is COMPLETE.\n* Track remaining MOVES/ENERGY by counting tiles with value 15.\n* Track LIVES by counting distinct 2×2 blocks of 8s.\n\n# GENERAL NOTES\n* The grid is a bird’s-eye view.\n* If the grid does not change after an action, you likely attempted an illegal move into 4s.\n* Favor routes marked by 3s; use the generator (0/9 patch surrounded by 3s) to cycle keys; confirm the match by comparing the bottom-left indicator (boxed by 4s) to the 0/9 lock pattern found near 5s; then proceed to the exit.\n\n# EXAMPLE STRATEGY OBSERVATION\nThe 8×8 player (top rows 12s, bottom rows 9s) is touching 4s on the left, so LEFT is blocked. I see a 0/9 patch with only 3s around it to the right—that’s likely the generator. I should move RIGHT to step on/off it until the bottom-left indicator (boxed by 4s) matches the lock pattern I see near the 5s, then head to the exit.\n\n# TURN:\nCall exactly one action.\n\n"

    "content": "\n# CONTEXT:\nYou are an agent playing a dynamic game. Your objective is to\nWIN and avoid GAME_OVER while minimizing actions.\n\nOne action produces one Frame. One Frame is made of one or more sequential\nGrids. Each Grid is a matrix size INT<0,63> by INT<0,63> filled with\nINT<0,15> values. Each value represents a different color and usually implies a different object.\n\nYou are playing a game called LockSmith.\n\n# CONTROLS\n* RESET: start over\n* ACTION1: move up\n* ACTION2: move down\n* ACTION3: move left\n* ACTION4: move right\n* ACTION5/ACTION6: no-ops\n\n# ORIENTATION (read carefully)\n* The global frame is fixed: the bottom-left KEY INDICATOR is always at the bottom-left; the EXIT/lock is elsewhere.\n* ACTION1 (UP) moves you toward the area where 15s (move counters) are located; use this as a compass for “up.”\n* ACTION4 (RIGHT) increases your distance from the bottom-left key indicator; ACTION3 (LEFT) decreases it.\n* Legality checks with 4s (walls):\n  - RIGHT is ILLEGAL if any 4s lie immediately to the right (“after” in row order) of any 12/9 cells of your 8×8 player.\n  - LEFT is ILLEGAL if any 4s lie immediately to the left (“before” in row order) of any 12/9 cells of your 8×8 player.\n  - UP is ILLEGAL if any 4s lie directly above the topmost 12 row of your player.\n  - DOWN is ILLEGAL if any 4s lie directly below the bottommost 9 row of your player.\n* Always orient carefully before moving: check where the 15s lie (for UP), how far you are from the bottom-left indicator (for LEFT/RIGHT), and whether 4s precede/follow your 12s/9s in the intended direction.\n\n# GOAL\nFind/generate a key that MATCHES the key pattern shown at the EXIT, then navigate to the EXIT to finish the level.\nThere are 6 levels total. Complete all levels to WIN.\n\n# TILE MEANINGS (important ones)\n* 0 = white cell (used in key patterns)\n* 3 = walkable path / corridor marker (often outlines routes to key/exit)\n* 4 = WALL (solid). You cannot enter 4s.\n* 5 = EXIT indicator (presence of 5s marks/frames the exit area)\n* 8 = LIFE token (count lives as the number of 2×2 blocks of 8s)\n* 9 = blue cells (used in player lower body; also appear elsewhere in the map and in key logic)\n* 12 = orange cells (used in player upper body)\n* 15 = MOVE counter (number of 15s ≈ moves/energy left)\n\n# PLAYER (sprite + movement legality)\n* The player is an 8×8 sprite made ONLY of 12s (top two rows) over 9s (bottom six rows).\n  - Concretely: rows 0–1 (relative to the sprite) are all 12s; rows 2–7 are all 9s.\n  - Other scattered 9s on the board are NOT the player—only the exact 8×8 (2×8 of 12s stacked on 6×8 of 9s) is the player.\n* Movement rules:\n  - You may move only through non-4 cells (i.e., never overlap a 4 after a move).\n  - If any part of your 8×8 sprite would overlap a 4 in the target direction (including cases where 4s lie “under” 9s), that move is ILLEGAL.\n  - If your sprite is already touching 4s on a side, you cannot move further in that touching direction until you have clearance.\n  - Practically: navigate corridors “between the 4s”.\n\n# KEYS, EXIT, AND HOW TO FIND THEM\n* Bottom-left KEY INDICATOR (non-interactive):\n  - A small block of 0s and 9s COMPLETELY BOXED by 4s in the bottom-left of the entire grid.\n  - This is NOT reachable and NOT a gameplay area. It only shows your CURRENT selected key.\n* EXIT (the lock to open):\n  - Elsewhere on the map, the lock is the target 0/9 pattern you must match, adjacent to some 5s (the 5s need not fully surround it).\n  - You may leave the level only when your current key EXACTLY matches this lock’s 0/9 distribution.\n* KEY GENERATOR (interactive, how to generate keys):\n  - Look for a patch consisting of 0s and 9s that has a CLEAR path of 3s leading to it and around it, and is NOT bordered by 5s or boxed by 4s.\n  - When any part of your 8×8 player steps ONTO this patch, it GENERATES a NEW candidate key and updates the bottom-left indicator.\n  - Step OFF the patch and then back ON to generate yet another candidate key; repeat to cycle through the set of keys.\n  - Continue cycling until the bottom-left indicator EXACTLY matches the lock pattern at the exit (the same 0/9 layout adjacent to 5s).\n* Locating things quickly:\n  - Generator: 0/9 patch accessible via 3s, with only 3s around it (no 5s), is almost certainly the generator.\n  - Exit: a matching 0/9 pattern near 5s marks the lock/exit area.\n\n# HUD / PROGRESSION\n* Visual score on the second-to-last grid row (row 62): it contains several 4-cell “slots”.\n  - Slots made of 3s represent UNFINISHED levels.\n  - When a slot changes from 3s to another color, that level is COMPLETE.\n* Track remaining MOVES/ENERGY by counting tiles with value 15.\n* Track LIVES by counting distinct 2×2 blocks of 8s.\n\n# GENERAL NOTES\n* The grid is a bird’s-eye view.\n* If the grid does not change after an action, you likely attempted an illegal move into 4s.\n* Favor routes marked by 3s; use the generator (0/9 patch surrounded by 3s) to cycle keys; confirm the match by comparing the bottom-left indicator (boxed by 4s) to the 0/9 lock pattern found near 5s; then proceed to the exit.\n\n# EXAMPLE STRATEGY OBSERVATION\nThe 8×8 player (top rows 12s, bottom rows 9s) is touching 4s on the left, so LEFT is blocked. I see a 0/9 patch with only 3s around it to the right—that’s likely the generator. I should move RIGHT to step on/off it until the bottom-left indicator (boxed by 4s) matches the lock pattern I see near the 5s, then head to the exit.\n\n# TURN:\nCall exactly one action.\n\n"

    "content": "\n# CONTEXT:\nYou are an agent playing a dynamic game. Your objective is to\nWIN and avoid GAME_OVER while minimizing actions.\n\nOne action produces one Frame. One Frame is made of one or more sequential\nGrids. Each Grid is a matrix size INT<0,63> by INT<0,63> filled with\nINT<0,15> values. Each value represents a different color and usually implies a different object.\n\nYou are playing a game called LockSmith.\n\n# CONTROLS\n* RESET: start over\n* ACTION1: move up\n* ACTION2: move down\n* ACTION3: move left\n* ACTION4: move right\n* ACTION5/ACTION6: no-ops\n\n# ORIENTATION (read carefully)\n* The global frame is fixed: the bottom-left KEY INDICATOR is always at the bottom-left; the EXIT/lock is elsewhere.\n* ACTION1 (UP) moves you toward the area where 15s (move counters) are located; use this as a compass for “up.”\n* ACTION4 (RIGHT) increases your distance from the bottom-left key indicator; ACTION3 (LEFT) decreases it.\n* Legality checks with 4s (walls):\n  - RIGHT is ILLEGAL if any 4s lie immediately to the right (“after” in row order) of any 12/9 cells of your 8×8 player.\n  - LEFT is ILLEGAL if any 4s lie immediately to the left (“before” in row order) of any 12/9 cells of your 8×8 player.\n  - UP is ILLEGAL if any 4s lie directly above the topmost 12 row of your player.\n  - DOWN is ILLEGAL if any 4s lie directly below the bottommost 9 row of your player.\n* Always orient carefully before moving: check where the 15s lie (for UP), how far you are from the bottom-left indicator (for LEFT/RIGHT), and whether 4s precede/follow your 12s/9s in the intended direction.\n\n# GOAL\nFind/generate a key that MATCHES the key pattern shown at the EXIT, then navigate to the EXIT to finish the level.\nThere are 6 levels total. Complete all levels to WIN.\n\n# TILE MEANINGS (important ones)\n* 0 = white cell (used in key patterns)\n* 3 = walkable path / corridor marker (often outlines routes to key/exit)\n* 4 = WALL (solid). You cannot enter 4s.\n* 5 = EXIT indicator (presence of 5s marks/frames the exit area)\n* 8 = LIFE token (count lives as the number of 2×2 blocks of 8s)\n* 9 = blue cells (used in player lower body; also appear elsewhere in the map and in key logic)\n* 12 = orange cells (used in player upper body)\n* 15 = MOVE counter (number of 15s ≈ moves/energy left)\n\n# PLAYER (sprite + movement legality)\n* The player is an 8×8 sprite made ONLY of 12s (top two rows) over 9s (bottom six rows).\n  - Concretely: rows 0–1 (relative to the sprite) are all 12s; rows 2–7 are all 9s.\n  - Other scattered 9s on the board are NOT the player—only the exact 8×8 (2×8 of 12s stacked on 6×8 of 9s) is the player.\n* Movement rules:\n  - You may move only through non-4 cells (i.e., never overlap a 4 after a move).\n  - If any part of your 8×8 sprite would overlap a 4 in the target direction (including cases where 4s lie “under” 9s), that move is ILLEGAL.\n  - If your sprite is already touching 4s on a side, you cannot move further in that touching direction until you have clearance.\n  - Practically: navigate corridors “between the 4s”.\n\n# KEYS, EXIT, AND HOW TO FIND THEM\n* Bottom-left KEY INDICATOR (non-interactive):\n  - A small block of 0s and 9s COMPLETELY BOXED by 4s in the bottom-left of the entire grid.\n  - This is NOT reachable and NOT a gameplay area. It only shows your CURRENT selected key.\n* EXIT (the lock to open):\n  - Elsewhere on the map, the lock is the target 0/9 pattern you must match, adjacent to some 5s (the 5s need not fully surround it).\n  - You may leave the level only when your current key EXACTLY matches this lock’s 0/9 distribution.\n* KEY GENERATOR (interactive, how to generate keys):\n  - Look for a patch consisting of 0s and 9s that has a CLEAR path of 3s leading to it and around it, and is NOT bordered by 5s or boxed by 4s.\n  - When any part of your 8×8 player steps ONTO this patch, it GENERATES a NEW candidate key and updates the bottom-left indicator.\n  - Step OFF the patch and then back ON to generate yet another candidate key; repeat to cycle through the set of keys.\n  - Continue cycling until the bottom-left indicator EXACTLY matches the lock pattern at the exit (the same 0/9 layout adjacent to 5s).\n* Locating things quickly:\n  - Generator: 0/9 patch accessible via 3s, with only 3s around it (no 5s), is almost certainly the generator.\n  - Exit: a matching 0/9 pattern near 5s marks the lock/exit area.\n\n# HUD / PROGRESSION\n* Visual score on the second-to-last grid row (row 62): it contains several 4-cell “slots”.\n  - Slots made of 3s represent UNFINISHED levels.\n  - When a slot changes from 3s to another color, that level is COMPLETE.\n* Track remaining MOVES/ENERGY by counting tiles with value 15.\n* Track LIVES by counting distinct 2×2 blocks of 8s.\n\n# GENERAL NOTES\n* The grid is a bird’s-eye view.\n* If the grid does not change after an action, you likely attempted an illegal move into 4s.\n* Favor routes marked by 3s; use the generator (0/9 patch surrounded by 3s) to cycle keys; confirm the match by comparing the bottom-left indicator (boxed by 4s) to the 0/9 lock pattern found near 5s; then proceed to the exit.\n\n# EXAMPLE STRATEGY OBSERVATION\nThe 8×8 player (top rows 12s, bottom rows 9s) is touching 4s on the left, so LEFT is blocked. I see a 0/9 patch with only 3s around it to the right—that’s likely the generator. I should move RIGHT to step on/off it until the bottom-left indicator (boxed by 4s) matches the lock pattern I see near the 5s, then head to the exit.\n\n# TURN:\nCall exactly one action.\n\n"

    "content": "\n# CONTEXT:\nYou are an agent playing a dynamic game. Your objective is to\nWIN and avoid GAME_OVER while minimizing actions.\n\nOne action produces one Frame. One Frame is made of one or more sequential\nGrids. Each Grid is a matrix size INT<0,63> by INT<0,63> filled with\nINT<0,15> values. Each value represents a different color and usually implies a different object.\n\nYou are playing a game called LockSmith.\n\n# CONTROLS\n* RESET: start over\n* ACTION1: move up\n* ACTION2: move down\n* ACTION3: move left\n* ACTION4: move right\n* ACTION5/ACTION6: no-ops\n\n# ORIENTATION (read carefully)\n* The global frame is fixed: the bottom-left KEY INDICATOR is always at the bottom-left; the EXIT/lock is elsewhere.\n* ACTION1 (UP) moves you toward the area where 15s (move counters) are located; use this as a compass for “up.”\n* ACTION4 (RIGHT) increases your distance from the bottom-left key indicator; ACTION3 (LEFT) decreases it.\n* Legality checks with 4s (walls):\n  - RIGHT is ILLEGAL if any 4s lie immediately to the right (“after” in row order) of any 12/9 cells of your 8×8 player.\n  - LEFT is ILLEGAL if any 4s lie immediately to the left (“before” in row order) of any 12/9 cells of your 8×8 player.\n  - UP is ILLEGAL if any 4s lie directly above the topmost 12 row of your player.\n  - DOWN is ILLEGAL if any 4s lie directly below the bottommost 9 row of your player.\n* Always orient carefully before moving: check where the 15s lie (for UP), how far you are from the bottom-left indicator (for LEFT/RIGHT), and whether 4s precede/follow your 12s/9s in the intended direction.\n\n# GOAL\nFind/generate a key that MATCHES the key pattern shown at the EXIT, then navigate to the EXIT to finish the level.\nThere are 6 levels total. Complete all levels to WIN.\n\n# TILE MEANINGS (important ones)\n* 0 = white cell (used in key patterns)\n* 3 = walkable path / corridor marker (often outlines routes to key/exit)\n* 4 = WALL (solid). You cannot enter 4s.\n* 5 = EXIT indicator (presence of 5s marks/frames the exit area)\n* 8 = LIFE token (count lives as the number of 2×2 blocks of 8s)\n* 9 = blue cells (used in player lower body; also appear elsewhere in the map and in key logic)\n* 12 = orange cells (used in player upper body)\n* 15 = MOVE counter (number of 15s ≈ moves/energy left)\n\n# PLAYER (sprite + movement legality)\n* The player is an 8×8 sprite made ONLY of 12s (top two rows) over 9s (bottom six rows).\n  - Concretely: rows 0–1 (relative to the sprite) are all 12s; rows 2–7 are all 9s.\n  - Other scattered 9s on the board are NOT the player—only the exact 8×8 (2×8 of 12s stacked on 6×8 of 9s) is the player.\n* Movement rules:\n  - You may move only through non-4 cells (i.e., never overlap a 4 after a move).\n  - If any part of your 8×8 sprite would overlap a 4 in the target direction (including cases where 4s lie “under” 9s), that move is ILLEGAL.\n  - If your sprite is already touching 4s on a side, you cannot move further in that touching direction until you have clearance.\n  - Practically: navigate corridors “between the 4s”.\n\n# KEYS, EXIT, AND HOW TO FIND THEM\n* Bottom-left KEY INDICATOR (non-interactive):\n  - A small block of 0s and 9s COMPLETELY BOXED by 4s in the bottom-left of the entire grid.\n  - This is NOT reachable and NOT a gameplay area. It only shows your CURRENT selected key.\n* EXIT (the lock to open):\n  - Elsewhere on the map, the lock is the target 0/9 pattern you must match, adjacent to some 5s (the 5s need not fully surround it).\n  - You may leave the level only when your current key EXACTLY matches this lock’s 0/9 distribution.\n* KEY GENERATOR (interactive, how to generate keys):\n  - Look for a patch consisting of 0s and 9s that has a CLEAR path of 3s leading to it and around it, and is NOT bordered by 5s or boxed by 4s.\n  - When any part of your 8×8 player steps ONTO this patch, it GENERATES a NEW candidate key and updates the bottom-left indicator.\n  - Step OFF the patch and then back ON to generate yet another candidate key; repeat to cycle through the set of keys.\n  - Continue cycling until the bottom-left indicator EXACTLY matches the lock pattern at the exit (the same 0/9 layout adjacent to 5s).\n* Locating things quickly:\n  - Generator: 0/9 patch accessible via 3s, with only 3s around it (no 5s), is almost certainly the generator.\n  - Exit: a matching 0/9 pattern near 5s marks the lock/exit area.\n\n# HUD / PROGRESSION\n* Visual score on the second-to-last grid row (row 62): it contains several 4-cell “slots”.\n  - Slots made of 3s represent UNFINISHED levels.\n  - When a slot changes from 3s to another color, that level is COMPLETE.\n* Track remaining MOVES/ENERGY by counting tiles with value 15.\n* Track LIVES by counting distinct 2×2 blocks of 8s.\n\n# GENERAL NOTES\n* The grid is a bird’s-eye view.\n* If the grid does not change after an action, you likely attempted an illegal move into 4s.\n* Favor routes marked by 3s; use the generator (0/9 patch surrounded by 3s) to cycle keys; confirm the match by comparing the bottom-left indicator (boxed by 4s) to the 0/9 lock pattern found near 5s; then proceed to the exit.\n\n# EXAMPLE STRATEGY OBSERVATION\nThe 8×8 player (top rows 12s, bottom rows 9s) is touching 4s on the left, so LEFT is blocked. I see a 0/9 patch with only 3s around it to the right—that’s likely the generator. I should move RIGHT to step on/off it until the bottom-left indicator (boxed by 4s) matches the lock pattern I see near the 5s, then head to the exit.\n\n# TURN:\nCall exactly one action.\n\n"

    "content": "\n# CONTEXT:\nYou are an agent playing a dynamic game. Your objective is to\nWIN and avoid GAME_OVER while minimizing actions.\n\nOne action produces one Frame. One Frame is made of one or more sequential\nGrids. Each Grid is a matrix size INT<0,63> by INT<0,63> filled with\nINT<0,15> values. Each value represents a different color and usually implies a different object.\n\nYou are playing a game called LockSmith.\n\n# CONTROLS\n* RESET: start over\n* ACTION1: move up\n* ACTION2: move down\n* ACTION3: move left\n* ACTION4: move right\n* ACTION5/ACTION6: no-ops\n\n# ORIENTATION (read carefully)\n* The global frame is fixed: the bottom-left KEY INDICATOR is always at the bottom-left; the EXIT/lock is elsewhere.\n* ACTION1 (UP) moves you toward the area where 15s (move counters) are located; use this as a compass for “up.”\n* ACTION4 (RIGHT) increases your distance from the bottom-left key indicator; ACTION3 (LEFT) decreases it.\n* Legality checks with 4s (walls):\n  - RIGHT is ILLEGAL if any 4s lie immediately to the right (“after” in row order) of any 12/9 cells of your 8×8 player.\n  - LEFT is ILLEGAL if any 4s lie immediately to the left (“before” in row order) of any 12/9 cells of your 8×8 player.\n  - UP is ILLEGAL if any 4s lie directly above the topmost 12 row of your player.\n  - DOWN is ILLEGAL if any 4s lie directly below the bottommost 9 row of your player.\n* Always orient carefully before moving: check where the 15s lie (for UP), how far you are from the bottom-left indicator (for LEFT/RIGHT), and whether 4s precede/follow your 12s/9s in the intended direction.\n\n# GOAL\nFind/generate a key that MATCHES the key pattern shown at the EXIT, then navigate to the EXIT to finish the level.\nThere are 6 levels total. Complete all levels to WIN.\n\n# TILE MEANINGS (important ones)\n* 0 = white cell (used in key patterns)\n* 3 = walkable path / corridor marker (often outlines routes to key/exit)\n* 4 = WALL (solid). You cannot enter 4s.\n* 5 = EXIT indicator (presence of 5s marks/frames the exit area)\n* 8 = LIFE token (count lives as the number of 2×2 blocks of 8s)\n* 9 = blue cells (used in player lower body; also appear elsewhere in the map and in key logic)\n* 12 = orange cells (used in player upper body)\n* 15 = MOVE counter (number of 15s ≈ moves/energy left)\n\n# PLAYER (sprite + movement legality)\n* The player is an 8×8 sprite made ONLY of 12s (top two rows) over 9s (bottom six rows).\n  - Concretely: rows 0–1 (relative to the sprite) are all 12s; rows 2–7 are all 9s.\n  - Other scattered 9s on the board are NOT the player—only the exact 8×8 (2×8 of 12s stacked on 6×8 of 9s) is the player.\n* Movement rules:\n  - You may move only through non-4 cells (i.e., never overlap a 4 after a move).\n  - If any part of your 8×8 sprite would overlap a 4 in the target direction (including cases where 4s lie “under” 9s), that move is ILLEGAL.\n  - If your sprite is already touching 4s on a side, you cannot move further in that touching direction until you have clearance.\n  - Practically: navigate corridors “between the 4s”.\n\n# KEYS, EXIT, AND HOW TO FIND THEM\n* Bottom-left KEY INDICATOR (non-interactive):\n  - A small block of 0s and 9s COMPLETELY BOXED by 4s in the bottom-left of the entire grid.\n  - This is NOT reachable and NOT a gameplay area. It only shows your CURRENT selected key.\n* EXIT (the lock to open):\n  - Elsewhere on the map, the lock is the target 0/9 pattern you must match, adjacent to some 5s (the 5s need not fully surround it).\n  - You may leave the level only when your current key EXACTLY matches this lock’s 0/9 distribution.\n* KEY GENERATOR (interactive, how to generate keys):\n  - Look for a patch consisting of 0s and 9s that has a CLEAR path of 3s leading to it and around it, and is NOT bordered by 5s or boxed by 4s.\n  - When any part of your 8×8 player steps ONTO this patch, it GENERATES a NEW candidate key and updates the bottom-left indicator.\n  - Step OFF the patch and then back ON to generate yet another candidate key; repeat to cycle through the set of keys.\n  - Continue cycling until the bottom-left indicator EXACTLY matches the lock pattern at the exit (the same 0/9 layout adjacent to 5s).\n* Locating things quickly:\n  - Generator: 0/9 patch accessible via 3s, with only 3s around it (no 5s), is almost certainly the generator.\n  - Exit: a matching 0/9 pattern near 5s marks the lock/exit area.\n\n# HUD / PROGRESSION\n* Visual score on the second-to-last grid row (row 62): it contains several 4-cell “slots”.\n  - Slots made of 3s represent UNFINISHED levels.\n  - When a slot changes from 3s to another color, that level is COMPLETE.\n* Track remaining MOVES/ENERGY by counting tiles with value 15.\n* Track LIVES by counting distinct 2×2 blocks of 8s.\n\n# GENERAL NOTES\n* The grid is a bird’s-eye view.\n* If the grid does not change after an action, you likely attempted an illegal move into 4s.\n* Favor routes marked by 3s; use the generator (0/9 patch surrounded by 3s) to cycle keys; confirm the match by comparing the bottom-left indicator (boxed by 4s) to the 0/9 lock pattern found near 5s; then proceed to the exit.\n\n# EXAMPLE STRATEGY OBSERVATION\nThe 8×8 player (top rows 12s, bottom rows 9s) is touching 4s on the left, so LEFT is blocked. I see a 0/9 patch with only 3s around it to the right—that’s likely the generator. I should move RIGHT to step on/off it until the bottom-left indicator (boxed by 4s) matches the lock pattern I see near the 5s, then head to the exit.\n\n# TURN:\nCall exactly one action.\n\n"

    "content": "\n# CONTEXT:\nYou are an agent playing a dynamic game. Your objective is to\nWIN and avoid GAME_OVER while minimizing actions.\n\nOne action produces one Frame. One Frame is made of one or more sequential\nGrids. Each Grid is a matrix size INT<0,63> by INT<0,63> filled with\nINT<0,15> values. Each value represents a different color and usually implies a different object.\n\nYou are playing a game called LockSmith.\n\n# CONTROLS\n* RESET: start over\n* ACTION1: move up\n* ACTION2: move down\n* ACTION3: move left\n* ACTION4: move right\n* ACTION5/ACTION6: no-ops\n\n# ORIENTATION (read carefully)\n* The global frame is fixed: the bottom-left KEY INDICATOR is always at the bottom-left; the EXIT/lock is elsewhere.\n* ACTION1 (UP) moves you toward the area where 15s (move counters) are located; use this as a compass for “up.”\n* ACTION4 (RIGHT) increases your distance from the bottom-left key indicator; ACTION3 (LEFT) decreases it.\n* Legality checks with 4s (walls):\n  - RIGHT is ILLEGAL if any 4s lie immediately to the right (“after” in row order) of any 12/9 cells of your 8×8 player.\n  - LEFT is ILLEGAL if any 4s lie immediately to the left (“before” in row order) of any 12/9 cells of your 8×8 player.\n  - UP is ILLEGAL if any 4s lie directly above the topmost 12 row of your player.\n  - DOWN is ILLEGAL if any 4s lie directly below the bottommost 9 row of your player.\n* Always orient carefully before moving: check where the 15s lie (for UP), how far you are from the bottom-left indicator (for LEFT/RIGHT), and whether 4s precede/follow your 12s/9s in the intended direction.\n\n# GOAL\nFind/generate a key that MATCHES the key pattern shown at the EXIT, then navigate to the EXIT to finish the level.\nThere are 6 levels total. Complete all levels to WIN.\n\n# TILE MEANINGS (important ones)\n* 0 = white cell (used in key patterns)\n* 3 = walkable path / corridor marker (often outlines routes to key/exit)\n* 4 = WALL (solid). You cannot enter 4s.\n* 5 = EXIT indicator (presence of 5s marks/frames the exit area)\n* 8 = LIFE token (count lives as the number of 2×2 blocks of 8s)\n* 9 = blue cells (used in player lower body; also appear elsewhere in the map and in key logic)\n* 12 = orange cells (used in player upper body)\n* 15 = MOVE counter (number of 15s ≈ moves/energy left)\n\n# PLAYER (sprite + movement legality)\n* The player is an 8×8 sprite made ONLY of 12s (top two rows) over 9s (bottom six rows).\n  - Concretely: rows 0–1 (relative to the sprite) are all 12s; rows 2–7 are all 9s.\n  - Other scattered 9s on the board are NOT the player—only the exact 8×8 (2×8 of 12s stacked on 6×8 of 9s) is the player.\n* Movement rules:\n  - You may move only through non-4 cells (i.e., never overlap a 4 after a move).\n  - If any part of your 8×8 sprite would overlap a 4 in the target direction (including cases where 4s lie “under” 9s), that move is ILLEGAL.\n  - If your sprite is already touching 4s on a side, you cannot move further in that touching direction until you have clearance.\n  - Practically: navigate corridors “between the 4s”.\n\n# KEYS, EXIT, AND HOW TO FIND THEM\n* Bottom-left KEY INDICATOR (non-interactive):\n  - A small block of 0s and 9s COMPLETELY BOXED by 4s in the bottom-left of the entire grid.\n  - This is NOT reachable and NOT a gameplay area. It only shows your CURRENT selected key.\n* EXIT (the lock to open):\n  - Elsewhere on the map, the lock is the target 0/9 pattern you must match, adjacent to some 5s (the 5s need not fully surround it).\n  - You may leave the level only when your current key EXACTLY matches this lock’s 0/9 distribution.\n* KEY GENERATOR (interactive, how to generate keys):\n  - Look for a patch consisting of 0s and 9s that has a CLEAR path of 3s leading to it and around it, and is NOT bordered by 5s or boxed by 4s.\n  - When any part of your 8×8 player steps ONTO this patch, it GENERATES a NEW candidate key and updates the bottom-left indicator.\n  - Step OFF the patch and then back ON to generate yet another candidate key; repeat to cycle through the set of keys.\n  - Continue cycling until the bottom-left indicator EXACTLY matches the lock pattern at the exit (the same 0/9 layout adjacent to 5s).\n* Locating things quickly:\n  - Generator: 0/9 patch accessible via 3s, with only 3s around it (no 5s), is almost certainly the generator.\n  - Exit: a matching 0/9 pattern near 5s marks the lock/exit area.\n\n# HUD / PROGRESSION\n* Visual score on the second-to-last grid row (row 62): it contains several 4-cell “slots”.\n  - Slots made of 3s represent UNFINISHED levels.\n  - When a slot changes from 3s to another color, that level is COMPLETE.\n* Track remaining MOVES/ENERGY by counting tiles with value 15.\n* Track LIVES by counting distinct 2×2 blocks of 8s.\n\n# GENERAL NOTES\n* The grid is a bird’s-eye view.\n* If the grid does not change after an action, you likely attempted an illegal move into 4s.\n* Favor routes marked by 3s; use the generator (0/9 patch surrounded by 3s) to cycle keys; confirm the match by comparing the bottom-left indicator (boxed by 4s) to the 0/9 lock pattern found near 5s; then proceed to the exit.\n\n# EXAMPLE STRATEGY OBSERVATION\nThe 8×8 player (top rows 12s, bottom rows 9s) is touching 4s on the left, so LEFT is blocked. I see a 0/9 patch with only 3s around it to the right—that’s likely the generator. I should move RIGHT to step on/off it until the bottom-left indicator (boxed by 4s) matches the lock pattern I see near the 5s, then head to the exit.\n\n# TURN:\nCall exactly one action.\n\n"

Each value represents a different color and usually implies a different object.\n\nYou are playing a game called LockSmith.\n\n# CONTROLS\n* RESET: start over\n* ACTION1: move up\n* ACTION2: move down\n* ACTION3: move left\n* ACTION4: move right\n* ACTION5/ACTION6: no-ops\n\n# ORIENTATION (read carefully)\n* The global frame is fixed: the bottom-left KEY INDICATOR is always at the bottom-left; the EXIT/lock is elsewhere.\n* ACTION1 (UP) moves you toward the area where 15s (move counters) are located; use this as a compass for “up.”\n* ACTION4 (RIGHT) increases your distance from the bottom-left key indicator; ACTION3 (LEFT) decreases it.\n* Legality checks with 4s (walls):\n  - RIGHT is ILLEGAL if any 4s lie immediately to the right (“after” in row order) of any 12/9 cells of your 8×8 player.\n  - LEFT is ILLEGAL if any 4s lie immediately to the left (“before” in row order) of any 12/9 cells of your 8×8 player.\n  - UP is ILLEGAL if any 4s lie directly above the topmost 12 row of your player.\n  - DOWN is ILLEGAL if any 4s lie directly below the bottommost 9 row of your player.\n* Always orient carefully before moving: check where the 15s lie (for UP), how far you are from the bottom-left indicator (for LEFT/RIGHT), and whether 4s precede/follow your 12s/9s in the intended direction.\n\n# GOAL\nFind/generate a key that MATCHES the key pattern shown at the EXIT, then navigate to the EXIT to finish the level.\nThere are 6 levels total. Complete all levels to WIN.\n\n# TILE MEANINGS (important ones)\n* 0 = white cell (used in key patterns)\n* 3 = walkable path / corridor marker (often outlines routes to key/exit)\n* 4 = WALL (solid). You cannot enter 4s.\n* 5 = EXIT indicator (presence of 5s marks/frames the exit area)\n* 8 = LIFE token (count lives as the number of 2×2 blocks of 8s)\n* 9 = blue cells (used in player lower body; also appear elsewhere in the map and in key logic)\n* 12 = orange cells (used in player upper body)\n* 15 = MOVE counter (number of 15s ≈ moves/energy left)\n\n# PLAYER (sprite + movement legality)\n* The player is an 8×8 sprite made ONLY of 12s (top two rows) over 9s (bottom six rows).\n  - Concretely: rows 0–1 (relative to the sprite) are all 12s; rows 2–7 are all 9s.\n  - Other scattered 9s on the board are NOT the player—only the exact 8×8 (2×8 of 12s stacked on 6×8 of 9s) is the player.\n* Movement rules:\n  - You may move only through non-4 cells (i.e., never overlap a 4 after a move).\n  - If any part of your 8×8 sprite would overlap a 4 in the target direction (including cases where 4s lie “under” 9s), that move is ILLEGAL.\n  - If your sprite is already touching 4s on a side, you cannot move further in that touching direction until you have clearance.\n  - Practically: navigate corridors “between the 4s”.\n\n# KEYS, EXIT, AND HOW TO FIND THEM\n* Bottom-left KEY INDICATOR (non-interactive):\n  - A small block of 0s and 9s COMPLETELY BOXED by 4s in the bottom-left of the entire grid.\n  - This is NOT reachable and NOT a gameplay area. It only shows your CURRENT selected key.\n* EXIT (the lock to open):\n  - Elsewhere on the map, the lock is the target 0/9 pattern you must match, adjacent to some 5s (the 5s need not fully surround it).\n  - You may leave the level only when your current key EXACTLY matches this lock’s 0/9 distribution.\n* KEY GENERATOR (interactive, how to generate keys):\n  - Look for a patch consisting of 0s and 9s that has a CLEAR path of 3s leading to it and around it, and is NOT bordered by 5s or boxed by 4s.\n  - When any part of your 8×8 player steps ONTO this patch, it GENERATES a NEW candidate key and updates the bottom-left indicator.\n  - Step OFF the patch and then back ON to generate yet another candidate key; repeat to cycle through the set of keys.\n  - Continue cycling until the bottom-left indicator EXACTLY matches the lock pattern at the exit (the same 0/9 layout adjacent to 5s).\n* Locating things quickly:\n  - Generator: 0/9 patch accessible via 3s, with only 3s around it (no 5s), is almost certainly the generator.\n  - Exit: a matching 0/9 pattern near 5s marks the lock/exit area.\n\n# HUD / PROGRESSION\n* Visual score on the second-to-last grid row (row 62): it contains several 4-cell “slots”.\n  - Slots made of 3s represent UNFINISHED levels.\n  - When a slot changes from 3s to another color, that level is COMPLETE.\n* Track remaining MOVES/ENERGY by counting tiles with value 15.\n* Track LIVES by counting distinct 2×2 blocks of 8s.\n\n# GENERAL NOTES\n* The grid is a bird’s-eye view.\n* If the grid does not change after an action, you likely attempted an illegal move into 4s.\n* Favor routes marked by 3s; use the generator (0/9 patch surrounded by 3s) to cycle keys; confirm the match by comparing the bottom-left indicator (boxed by 4s) to the 0/9 lock pattern found near 5s; then proceed to the exit.\n\n# EXAMPLE STRATEGY OBSERVATION\nThe 8×8 player (top rows 12s, bottom rows 9s) is touching 4s on the left, so LEFT is blocked. I see a 0/9 patch with only 3s around it to the right—that’s likely the generator. I should move RIGHT to step on/off it until the bottom-left indicator (boxed by 4s) matches the lock pattern I see near the 5s, then head to the exit.\n\n# TURN:\nCall exactly one action.\n\n"

One Frame is made of one or more sequential\nGrids. Each Grid is a matrix size INT<0,63> by INT<0,63> filled with\nINT<0,15> values. Each value represents a different color and usually implies a different object.\n\nYou are playing a game called LockSmith.\n\n# CONTROLS\n* RESET: start over\n* ACTION1: move up\n* ACTION2: move down\n* ACTION3: move left\n* ACTION4: move right\n* ACTION5/ACTION6: no-ops\n\n# ORIENTATION (read carefully)\n* The global frame is fixed: the bottom-left KEY INDICATOR is always at the bottom-left; the EXIT/lock is elsewhere.\n* ACTION1 (UP) moves you toward the area where 15s (move counters) are located; use this as a compass for “up.”\n* ACTION4 (RIGHT) increases your distance from the bottom-left key indicator; ACTION3 (LEFT) decreases it.\n* Legality checks with 4s (walls):\n  - RIGHT is ILLEGAL if any 4s lie immediately to the right (“after” in row order) of any 12/9 cells of your 8×8 player.\n  - LEFT is ILLEGAL if any 4s lie immediately to the left (“before” in row order) of any 12/9 cells of your 8×8 player.\n  - UP is ILLEGAL if any 4s lie directly above the topmost 12 row of your player.\n  - DOWN is ILLEGAL if any 4s lie directly below the bottommost 9 row of your player.\n* Always orient carefully before moving: check where the 15s lie (for UP), how far you are from the bottom-left indicator (for LEFT/RIGHT), and whether 4s precede/follow your 12s/9s in the intended direction.\n\n# GOAL\nFind/generate a key that MATCHES the key pattern shown at the EXIT, then navigate to the EXIT to finish the level.\nThere are 6 levels total. Complete all levels to WIN.\n\n# TILE MEANINGS (important ones)\n* 0 = white cell (used in key patterns)\n* 3 = walkable path / corridor marker (often outlines routes to key/exit)\n* 4 = WALL (solid). You cannot enter 4s.\n* 5 = EXIT indicator (presence of 5s marks/frames the exit area)\n* 8 = LIFE token (count lives as the number of 2×2 blocks of 8s)\n* 9 = blue cells (used in player lower body; also appear elsewhere in the map and in key logic)\n* 12 = orange cells (used in player upper body)\n* 15 = MOVE counter (number of 15s ≈ moves/energy left)\n\n# PLAYER (sprite + movement legality)\n* The player is an 8×8 sprite made ONLY of 12s (top two rows) over 9s (bottom six rows).\n  - Concretely: rows 0–1 (relative to the sprite) are all 12s; rows 2–7 are all 9s.\n  - Other scattered 9s on the board are NOT the player—only the exact 8×8 (2×8 of 12s stacked on 6×8 of 9s) is the player.\n* Movement rules:\n  - You may move only through non-4 cells (i.e., never overlap a 4 after a move).\n  - If any part of your 8×8 sprite would overlap a 4 in the target direction (including cases where 4s lie “under” 9s), that move is ILLEGAL.\n  - If your sprite is already touching 4s on a side, you cannot move further in that touching direction until you have clearance.\n  - Practically: navigate corridors “between the 4s”.\n\n# KEYS, EXIT, AND HOW TO FIND THEM\n* Bottom-left KEY INDICATOR (non-interactive):\n  - A small block of 0s and 9s COMPLETELY BOXED by 4s in the bottom-left of the entire grid.\n  - This is NOT reachable and NOT a gameplay area. It only shows your CURRENT selected key.\n* EXIT (the lock to open):\n  - Elsewhere on the map, the lock is the target 0/9 pattern you must match, adjacent to some 5s (the 5s need not fully surround it).\n  - You may leave the level only when your current key EXACTLY matches this lock’s 0/9 distribution.\n* KEY GENERATOR (interactive, how to generate keys):\n  - Look for a patch consisting of 0s and 9s that has a CLEAR path of 3s leading to it and around it, and is NOT bordered by 5s or boxed by 4s.\n  - When any part of your 8×8 player steps ONTO this patch, it GENERATES a NEW candidate key and updates the bottom-left indicator.\n  - Step OFF the patch and then back ON to generate yet another candidate key; repeat to cycle through the set of keys.\n  - Continue cycling until the bottom-left indicator EXACTLY matches the lock pattern at the exit (the same 0/9 layout adjacent to 5s).\n* Locating things quickly:\n  - Generator: 0/9 patch accessible via 3s, with only 3s around it (no 5s), is almost certainly the generator.\n  - Exit: a matching 0/9 pattern near 5s marks the lock/exit area.\n\n# HUD / PROGRESSION\n* Visual score on the second-to-last grid row (row 62): it contains several 4-cell “slots”.\n  - Slots made of 3s represent UNFINISHED levels.\n  - When a slot changes from 3s to another color, that level is COMPLETE.\n* Track remaining MOVES/ENERGY by counting tiles with value 15.\n* Track LIVES by counting distinct 2×2 blocks of 8s.\n\n# GENERAL NOTES\n* The grid is a bird’s-eye view.\n* If the grid does not change after an action, you likely attempted an illegal move into 4s.\n* Favor routes marked by 3s; use the generator (0/9 patch surrounded by 3s) to cycle keys; confirm the match by comparing the bottom-left indicator (boxed by 4s) to the 0/9 lock pattern found near 5s; then proceed to the exit.\n\n# EXAMPLE STRATEGY OBSERVATION\nThe 8×8 player (top rows 12s, bottom rows 9s) is touching 4s on the left, so LEFT is blocked. I see a 0/9 patch with only 3s around it to the right—that’s likely the generator. I should move RIGHT to step on/off it until the bottom-left indicator (boxed by 4s) matches the lock pattern I see near the 5s, then head to the exit.\n\n# TURN:\nCall exactly one action.\n\n"

Each value represents a different color and usually implies a different object.\n\nYou are playing a game called LockSmith.\n\n# CONTROLS\n* RESET: start over\n* ACTION1: move up\n* ACTION2: move down\n* ACTION3: move left\n* ACTION4: move right\n* ACTION5/ACTION6: no-ops\n\n# ORIENTATION (read carefully)\n* The global frame is fixed: the bottom-left KEY INDICATOR is always at the bottom-left; the EXIT/lock is elsewhere.\n* ACTION1 (UP) moves you toward the area where 15s (move counters) are located; use this as a compass for “up.”\n* ACTION4 (RIGHT) increases your distance from the bottom-left key indicator; ACTION3 (LEFT) decreases it.\n* Legality checks with 4s (walls):\n  - RIGHT is ILLEGAL if any 4s lie immediately to the right (“after” in row order) of any 12/9 cells of your 8×8 player.\n  - LEFT is ILLEGAL if any 4s lie immediately to the left (“before” in row order) of any 12/9 cells of your 8×8 player.\n  - UP is ILLEGAL if any 4s lie directly above the topmost 12 row of your player.\n  - DOWN is ILLEGAL if any 4s lie directly below the bottommost 9 row of your player.\n* Always orient carefully before moving: check where the 15s lie (for UP), how far you are from the bottom-left indicator (for LEFT/RIGHT), and whether 4s precede/follow your 12s/9s in the intended direction.\n\n# GOAL\nFind/generate a key that MATCHES the key pattern shown at the EXIT, then navigate to the EXIT to finish the level.\nThere are 6 levels total. Complete all levels to WIN.\n\n# TILE MEANINGS (important ones)\n* 0 = white cell (used in key patterns)\n* 3 = walkable path / corridor marker (often outlines routes to key/exit)\n* 4 = WALL (solid). You cannot enter 4s.\n* 5 = EXIT indicator (presence of 5s marks/frames the exit area)\n* 8 = LIFE token (count lives as the number of 2×2 blocks of 8s)\n* 9 = blue cells (used in player lower body; also appear elsewhere in the map and in key logic)\n* 12 = orange cells (used in player upper body)\n* 15 = MOVE counter (number of 15s ≈ moves/energy left)\n\n# PLAYER (sprite + movement legality)\n* The player is an 8×8 sprite made ONLY of 12s (top two rows) over 9s (bottom six rows).\n  - Concretely: rows 0–1 (relative to the sprite) are all 12s; rows 2–7 are all 9s.\n  - Other scattered 9s on the board are NOT the player—only the exact 8×8 (2×8 of 12s stacked on 6×8 of 9s) is the player.\n* Movement rules:\n  - You may move only through non-4 cells (i.e., never overlap a 4 after a move).\n  - If any part of your 8×8 sprite would overlap a 4 in the target direction (including cases where 4s lie “under” 9s), that move is ILLEGAL.\n  - If your sprite is already touching 4s on a side, you cannot move further in that touching direction until you have clearance.\n  - Practically: navigate corridors “between the 4s”.\n\n# KEYS, EXIT, AND HOW TO FIND THEM\n* Bottom-left KEY INDICATOR (non-interactive):\n  - A small block of 0s and 9s COMPLETELY BOXED by 4s in the bottom-left of the entire grid.\n  - This is NOT reachable and NOT a gameplay area. It only shows your CURRENT selected key.\n* EXIT (the lock to open):\n  - Elsewhere on the map, the lock is the target 0/9 pattern you must match, adjacent to some 5s (the 5s need not fully surround it).\n  - You may leave the level only when your current key EXACTLY matches this lock’s 0/9 distribution.\n* KEY GENERATOR (interactive, how to generate keys):\n  - Look for a patch consisting of 0s and 9s that has a CLEAR path of 3s leading to it and around it, and is NOT bordered by 5s or boxed by 4s.\n  - When any part of your 8×8 player steps ONTO this patch, it GENERATES a NEW candidate key and updates the bottom-left indicator.\n  - Step OFF the patch and then back ON to generate yet another candidate key; repeat to cycle through the set of keys.\n  - Continue cycling until the bottom-left indicator EXACTLY matches the lock pattern at the exit (the same 0/9 layout adjacent to 5s).\n* Locating things quickly:\n  - Generator: 0/9 patch accessible via 3s, with only 3s around it (no 5s), is almost certainly the generator.\n  - Exit: a matching 0/9 pattern near 5s marks the lock/exit area.\n\n# HUD / PROGRESSION\n* Visual score on the second-to-last grid row (row 62): it contains several 4-cell “slots”.\n  - Slots made of 3s represent UNFINISHED levels.\n  - When a slot changes from 3s to another color, that level is COMPLETE.\n* Track remaining MOVES/ENERGY by counting tiles with value 15.\n* Track LIVES by counting distinct 2×2 blocks of 8s.\n\n# GENERAL NOTES\n* The grid is a bird’s-eye view.\n* If the grid does not change after an action, you likely attempted an illegal move into 4s.\n* Favor routes marked by 3s; use the generator (0/9 patch surrounded by 3s) to cycle keys; confirm the match by comparing the bottom-left indicator (boxed by 4s) to the 0/9 lock pattern found near 5s; then proceed to the exit.\n\n# EXAMPLE STRATEGY OBSERVATION\nThe 8×8 player (top rows 12s, bottom rows 9s) is touching 4s on the left, so LEFT is blocked. I see a 0/9 patch with only 3s around it to the right—that’s likely the generator. I should move RIGHT to step on/off it until the bottom-left indicator (boxed by 4s) matches the lock pattern I see near the 5s, then head to the exit.\n\n# TURN:\nCall exactly one action.\n\n"

One Frame is made of one or more sequential\nGrids. Each Grid is a matrix size INT<0,63> by INT<0,63> filled with\nINT<0,15> values. Each value represents a different color and usually implies a different object.\n\nYou are playing a game called LockSmith.\n\n# CONTROLS\n* RESET: start over\n* ACTION1: move up\n* ACTION2: move down\n* ACTION3: move left\n* ACTION4: move right\n* ACTION5/ACTION6: no-ops\n\n# ORIENTATION (read carefully)\n* The global frame is fixed: the bottom-left KEY INDICATOR is always at the bottom-left; the EXIT/lock is elsewhere.\n* ACTION1 (UP) moves you toward the area where 15s (move counters) are located; use this as a compass for “up.”\n* ACTION4 (RIGHT) increases your distance from the bottom-left key indicator; ACTION3 (LEFT) decreases it.\n* Legality checks with 4s (walls):\n  - RIGHT is ILLEGAL if any 4s lie immediately to the right (“after” in row order) of any 12/9 cells of your 8×8 player.\n  - LEFT is ILLEGAL if any 4s lie immediately to the left (“before” in row order) of any 12/9 cells of your 8×8 player.\n  - UP is ILLEGAL if any 4s lie directly above the topmost 12 row of your player.\n  - DOWN is ILLEGAL if any 4s lie directly below the bottommost 9 row of your player.\n* Always orient carefully before moving: check where the 15s lie (for UP), how far you are from the bottom-left indicator (for LEFT/RIGHT), and whether 4s precede/follow your 12s/9s in the intended direction.\n\n# GOAL\nFind/generate a key that MATCHES the key pattern shown at the EXIT, then navigate to the EXIT to finish the level.\nThere are 6 levels total. Complete all levels to WIN.\n\n# TILE MEANINGS (important ones)\n* 0 = white cell (used in key patterns)\n* 3 = walkable path / corridor marker (often outlines routes to key/exit)\n* 4 = WALL (solid). You cannot enter 4s.\n* 5 = EXIT indicator (presence of 5s marks/frames the exit area)\n* 8 = LIFE token (count lives as the number of 2×2 blocks of 8s)\n* 9 = blue cells (used in player lower body; also appear elsewhere in the map and in key logic)\n* 12 = orange cells (used in player upper body)\n* 15 = MOVE counter (number of 15s ≈ moves/energy left)\n\n# PLAYER (sprite + movement legality)\n* The player is an 8×8 sprite made ONLY of 12s (top two rows) over 9s (bottom six rows).\n  - Concretely: rows 0–1 (relative to the sprite) are all 12s; rows 2–7 are all 9s.\n  - Other scattered 9s on the board are NOT the player—only the exact 8×8 (2×8 of 12s stacked on 6×8 of 9s) is the player.\n* Movement rules:\n  - You may move only through non-4 cells (i.e., never overlap a 4 after a move).\n  - If any part of your 8×8 sprite would overlap a 4 in the target direction (including cases where 4s lie “under” 9s), that move is ILLEGAL.\n  - If your sprite is already touching 4s on a side, you cannot move further in that touching direction until you have clearance.\n  - Practically: navigate corridors “between the 4s”.\n\n# KEYS, EXIT, AND HOW TO FIND THEM\n* Bottom-left KEY INDICATOR (non-interactive):\n  - A small block of 0s and 9s COMPLETELY BOXED by 4s in the bottom-left of the entire grid.\n  - This is NOT reachable and NOT a gameplay area. It only shows your CURRENT selected key.\n* EXIT (the lock to open):\n  - Elsewhere on the map, the lock is the target 0/9 pattern you must match, adjacent to some 5s (the 5s need not fully surround it).\n  - You may leave the level only when your current key EXACTLY matches this lock’s 0/9 distribution.\n* KEY GENERATOR (interactive, how to generate keys):\n  - Look for a patch consisting of 0s and 9s that has a CLEAR path of 3s leading to it and around it, and is NOT bordered by 5s or boxed by 4s.\n  - When any part of your 8×8 player steps ONTO this patch, it GENERATES a NEW candidate key and updates the bottom-left indicator.\n  - Step OFF the patch and then back ON to generate yet another candidate key; repeat to cycle through the set of keys.\n  - Continue cycling until the bottom-left indicator EXACTLY matches the lock pattern at the exit (the same 0/9 layout adjacent to 5s).\n* Locating things quickly:\n  - Generator: 0/9 patch accessible via 3s, with only 3s around it (no 5s), is almost certainly the generator.\n  - Exit: a matching 0/9 pattern near 5s marks the lock/exit area.\n\n# HUD / PROGRESSION\n* Visual score on the second-to-last grid row (row 62): it contains several 4-cell “slots”.\n  - Slots made of 3s represent UNFINISHED levels.\n  - When a slot changes from 3s to another color, that level is COMPLETE.\n* Track remaining MOVES/ENERGY by counting tiles with value 15.\n* Track LIVES by counting distinct 2×2 blocks of 8s.\n\n# GENERAL NOTES\n* The grid is a bird’s-eye view.\n* If the grid does not change after an action, you likely attempted an illegal move into 4s.\n* Favor routes marked by 3s; use the generator (0/9 patch surrounded by 3s) to cycle keys; confirm the match by comparing the bottom-left indicator (boxed by 4s) to the 0/9 lock pattern found near 5s; then proceed to the exit.\n\n# EXAMPLE STRATEGY OBSERVATION\nThe 8×8 player (top rows 12s, bottom rows 9s) is touching 4s on the left, so LEFT is blocked. I see a 0/9 patch with only 3s around it to the right—that’s likely the generator. I should move RIGHT to step on/off it until the bottom-left indicator (boxed by 4s) matches the lock pattern I see near the 5s, then head to the exit.\n\n# TURN:\nCall exactly one action.\n\n"

    "content": "\n# CONTEXT:\nYou are an agent playing a dynamic game. Your objective is to\nWIN and avoid GAME_OVER while minimizing actions.\n\nOne action produces one Frame. One Frame is made of one or more sequential\nGrids. Each Grid is a matrix size INT<0,63> by INT<0,63> filled with\nINT<0,15> values. Each value represents a different color and usually implies a different object.\n\nYou are playing a game called LockSmith.\n\n# CONTROLS\n* RESET: start over\n* ACTION1: move up\n* ACTION2: move down\n* ACTION3: move left\n* ACTION4: move right\n* ACTION5/ACTION6: no-ops\n\n# ORIENTATION (read carefully)\n* The global frame is fixed: the bottom-left KEY INDICATOR is always at the bottom-left; the EXIT/lock is elsewhere.\n* ACTION1 (UP) moves you toward the area where 15s (move counters) are located; use this as a compass for “up.”\n* ACTION4 (RIGHT) increases your distance from the bottom-left key indicator; ACTION3 (LEFT) decreases it.\n* Legality checks with 4s (walls):\n  - RIGHT is ILLEGAL if any 4s lie immediately to the right (“after” in row order) of any 12/9 cells of your 8×8 player.\n  - LEFT is ILLEGAL if any 4s lie immediately to the left (“before” in row order) of any 12/9 cells of your 8×8 player.\n  - UP is ILLEGAL if any 4s lie directly above the topmost 12 row of your player.\n  - DOWN is ILLEGAL if any 4s lie directly below the bottommost 9 row of your player.\n* Always orient carefully before moving: check where the 15s lie (for UP), how far you are from the bottom-left indicator (for LEFT/RIGHT), and whether 4s precede/follow your 12s/9s in the intended direction.\n\n# GOAL\nFind/generate a key that MATCHES the key pattern shown at the EXIT, then navigate to the EXIT to finish the level.\nThere are 6 levels total. Complete all levels to WIN.\n\n# TILE MEANINGS (important ones)\n* 0 = white cell (used in key patterns)\n* 3 = walkable path / corridor marker (often outlines routes to key/exit)\n* 4 = WALL (solid). You cannot enter 4s.\n* 5 = EXIT indicator (presence of 5s marks/frames the exit area)\n* 8 = LIFE token (count lives as the number of 2×2 blocks of 8s)\n* 9 = blue cells (used in player lower body; also appear elsewhere in the map and in key logic)\n* 12 = orange cells (used in player upper body)\n* 15 = MOVE counter (number of 15s ≈ moves/energy left)\n\n# PLAYER (sprite + movement legality)\n* The player is an 8×8 sprite made ONLY of 12s (top two rows) over 9s (bottom six rows).\n  - Concretely: rows 0–1 (relative to the sprite) are all 12s; rows 2–7 are all 9s.\n  - Other scattered 9s on the board are NOT the player—only the exact 8×8 (2×8 of 12s stacked on 6×8 of 9s) is the player.\n* Movement rules:\n  - You may move only through non-4 cells (i.e., never overlap a 4 after a move).\n  - If any part of your 8×8 sprite would overlap a 4 in the target direction (including cases where 4s lie “under” 9s), that move is ILLEGAL.\n  - If your sprite is already touching 4s on a side, you cannot move further in that touching direction until you have clearance.\n  - Practically: navigate corridors “between the 4s”.\n\n# KEYS, EXIT, AND HOW TO FIND THEM\n* Bottom-left KEY INDICATOR (non-interactive):\n  - A small block of 0s and 9s COMPLETELY BOXED by 4s in the bottom-left of the entire grid.\n  - This is NOT reachable and NOT a gameplay area. It only shows your CURRENT selected key.\n* EXIT (the lock to open):\n  - Elsewhere on the map, the lock is the target 0/9 pattern you must match, adjacent to some 5s (the 5s need not fully surround it).\n  - You may leave the level only when your current key EXACTLY matches this lock’s 0/9 distribution.\n* KEY GENERATOR (interactive, how to generate keys):\n  - Look for a patch consisting of 0s and 9s that has a CLEAR path of 3s leading to it and around it, and is NOT bordered by 5s or boxed by 4s.\n  - When any part of your 8×8 player steps ONTO this patch, it GENERATES a NEW candidate key and updates the bottom-left indicator.\n  - Step OFF the patch and then back ON to generate yet another candidate key; repeat to cycle through the set of keys.\n  - Continue cycling until the bottom-left indicator EXACTLY matches the lock pattern at the exit (the same 0/9 layout adjacent to 5s).\n* Locating things quickly:\n  - Generator: 0/9 patch accessible via 3s, with only 3s around it (no 5s), is almost certainly the generator.\n  - Exit: a matching 0/9 pattern near 5s marks the lock/exit area.\n\n# HUD / PROGRESSION\n* Visual score on the second-to-last grid row (row 62): it contains several 4-cell “slots”.\n  - Slots made of 3s represent UNFINISHED levels.\n  - When a slot changes from 3s to another color, that level is COMPLETE.\n* Track remaining MOVES/ENERGY by counting tiles with value 15.\n* Track LIVES by counting distinct 2×2 blocks of 8s.\n\n# GENERAL NOTES\n* The grid is a bird’s-eye view.\n* If the grid does not change after an action, you likely attempted an illegal move into 4s.\n* Favor routes marked by 3s; use the generator (0/9 patch surrounded by 3s) to cycle keys; confirm the match by comparing the bottom-left indicator (boxed by 4s) to the 0/9 lock pattern found near 5s; then proceed to the exit.\n\n# EXAMPLE STRATEGY OBSERVATION\nThe 8×8 player (top rows 12s, bottom rows 9s) is touching 4s on the left, so LEFT is blocked. I see a 0/9 patch with only 3s around it to the right—that’s likely the generator. I should move RIGHT to step on/off it until the bottom-left indicator (boxed by 4s) matches the lock pattern I see near the 5s, then head to the exit.\n\n# TURN:\nCall exactly one action.\n\n"

    "content": "\n# CONTEXT:\nYou are an agent playing a dynamic game. Your objective is to\nWIN and avoid GAME_OVER while minimizing actions.\n\nOne action produces one Frame. One Frame is made of one or more sequential\nGrids. Each Grid is a matrix size INT<0,63> by INT<0,63> filled with\nINT<0,15> values. Each value represents a different color and usually implies a different object.\n\nYou are playing a game called LockSmith.\n\n# CONTROLS\n* RESET: start over\n* ACTION1: move up\n* ACTION2: move down\n* ACTION3: move left\n* ACTION4: move right\n* ACTION5/ACTION6: no-ops\n\n# ORIENTATION (read carefully)\n* The global frame is fixed: the bottom-left KEY INDICATOR is always at the bottom-left; the EXIT/lock is elsewhere.\n* ACTION1 (UP) moves you toward the area where 15s (move counters) are located; use this as a compass for “up.”\n* ACTION4 (RIGHT) increases your distance from the bottom-left key indicator; ACTION3 (LEFT) decreases it.\n* Legality checks with 4s (walls):\n  - RIGHT is ILLEGAL if any 4s lie immediately to the right (“after” in row order) of any 12/9 cells of your 8×8 player.\n  - LEFT is ILLEGAL if any 4s lie immediately to the left (“before” in row order) of any 12/9 cells of your 8×8 player.\n  - UP is ILLEGAL if any 4s lie directly above the topmost 12 row of your player.\n  - DOWN is ILLEGAL if any 4s lie directly below the bottommost 9 row of your player.\n* Always orient carefully before moving: check where the 15s lie (for UP), how far you are from the bottom-left indicator (for LEFT/RIGHT), and whether 4s precede/follow your 12s/9s in the intended direction.\n\n# GOAL\nFind/generate a key that MATCHES the key pattern shown at the EXIT, then navigate to the EXIT to finish the level.\nThere are 6 levels total. Complete all levels to WIN.\n\n# TILE MEANINGS (important ones)\n* 0 = white cell (used in key patterns)\n* 3 = walkable path / corridor marker (often outlines routes to key/exit)\n* 4 = WALL (solid). You cannot enter 4s.\n* 5 = EXIT indicator (presence of 5s marks/frames the exit area)\n* 8 = LIFE token (count lives as the number of 2×2 blocks of 8s)\n* 9 = blue cells (used in player lower body; also appear elsewhere in the map and in key logic)\n* 12 = orange cells (used in player upper body)\n* 15 = MOVE counter (number of 15s ≈ moves/energy left)\n\n# PLAYER (sprite + movement legality)\n* The player is an 8×8 sprite made ONLY of 12s (top two rows) over 9s (bottom six rows).\n  - Concretely: rows 0–1 (relative to the sprite) are all 12s; rows 2–7 are all 9s.\n  - Other scattered 9s on the board are NOT the player—only the exact 8×8 (2×8 of 12s stacked on 6×8 of 9s) is the player.\n* Movement rules:\n  - You may move only through non-4 cells (i.e., never overlap a 4 after a move).\n  - If any part of your 8×8 sprite would overlap a 4 in the target direction (including cases where 4s lie “under” 9s), that move is ILLEGAL.\n  - If your sprite is already touching 4s on a side, you cannot move further in that touching direction until you have clearance.\n  - Practically: navigate corridors “between the 4s”.\n\n# KEYS, EXIT, AND HOW TO FIND THEM\n* Bottom-left KEY INDICATOR (non-interactive):\n  - A small block of 0s and 9s COMPLETELY BOXED by 4s in the bottom-left of the entire grid.\n  - This is NOT reachable and NOT a gameplay area. It only shows your CURRENT selected key.\n* EXIT (the lock to open):\n  - Elsewhere on the map, the lock is the target 0/9 pattern you must match, adjacent to some 5s (the 5s need not fully surround it).\n  - You may leave the level only when your current key EXACTLY matches this lock’s 0/9 distribution.\n* KEY GENERATOR (interactive, how to generate keys):\n  - Look for a patch consisting of 0s and 9s that has a CLEAR path of 3s leading to it and around it, and is NOT bordered by 5s or boxed by 4s.\n  - When any part of your 8×8 player steps ONTO this patch, it GENERATES a NEW candidate key and updates the bottom-left indicator.\n  - Step OFF the patch and then back ON to generate yet another candidate key; repeat to cycle through the set of keys.\n  - Continue cycling until the bottom-left indicator EXACTLY matches the lock pattern at the exit (the same 0/9 layout adjacent to 5s).\n* Locating things quickly:\n  - Generator: 0/9 patch accessible via 3s, with only 3s around it (no 5s), is almost certainly the generator.\n  - Exit: a matching 0/9 pattern near 5s marks the lock/exit area.\n\n# HUD / PROGRESSION\n* Visual score on the second-to-last grid row (row 62): it contains several 4-cell “slots”.\n  - Slots made of 3s represent UNFINISHED levels.\n  - When a slot changes from 3s to another color, that level is COMPLETE.\n* Track remaining MOVES/ENERGY by counting tiles with value 15.\n* Track LIVES by counting distinct 2×2 blocks of 8s.\n\n# GENERAL NOTES\n* The grid is a bird’s-eye view.\n* If the grid does not change after an action, you likely attempted an illegal move into 4s.\n* Favor routes marked by 3s; use the generator (0/9 patch surrounded by 3s) to cycle keys; confirm the match by comparing the bottom-left indicator (boxed by 4s) to the 0/9 lock pattern found near 5s; then proceed to the exit.\n\n# EXAMPLE STRATEGY OBSERVATION\nThe 8×8 player (top rows 12s, bottom rows 9s) is touching 4s on the left, so LEFT is blocked. I see a 0/9 patch with only 3s around it to the right—that’s likely the generator. I should move RIGHT to step on/off it until the bottom-left indicator (boxed by 4s) matches the lock pattern I see near the 5s, then head to the exit.\n\n# TURN:\nCall exactly one action.\n\n"

    "content": "\n# CONTEXT:\nYou are an agent playing a dynamic game. Your objective is to\nWIN and avoid GAME_OVER while minimizing actions.\n\nOne action produces one Frame. One Frame is made of one or more sequential\nGrids. Each Grid is a matrix size INT<0,63> by INT<0,63> filled with\nINT<0,15> values. Each value represents a different color and usually implies a different object.\n\nYou are playing a game called LockSmith.\n\n# CONTROLS\n* RESET: start over\n* ACTION1: move up\n* ACTION2: move down\n* ACTION3: move left\n* ACTION4: move right\n* ACTION5/ACTION6: no-ops\n\n# ORIENTATION (read carefully)\n* The global frame is fixed: the bottom-left KEY INDICATOR is always at the bottom-left; the EXIT/lock is elsewhere.\n* ACTION1 (UP) moves you toward the area where 15s (move counters) are located; use this as a compass for “up.”\n* ACTION4 (RIGHT) increases your distance from the bottom-left key indicator; ACTION3 (LEFT) decreases it.\n* Legality checks with 4s (walls):\n  - RIGHT is ILLEGAL if any 4s lie immediately to the right (“after” in row order) of any 12/9 cells of your 8×8 player.\n  - LEFT is ILLEGAL if any 4s lie immediately to the left (“before” in row order) of any 12/9 cells of your 8×8 player.\n  - UP is ILLEGAL if any 4s lie directly above the topmost 12 row of your player.\n  - DOWN is ILLEGAL if any 4s lie directly below the bottommost 9 row of your player.\n* Always orient carefully before moving: check where the 15s lie (for UP), how far you are from the bottom-left indicator (for LEFT/RIGHT), and whether 4s precede/follow your 12s/9s in the intended direction.\n\n# GOAL\nFind/generate a key that MATCHES the key pattern shown at the EXIT, then navigate to the EXIT to finish the level.\nThere are 6 levels total. Complete all levels to WIN.\n\n# TILE MEANINGS (important ones)\n* 0 = white cell (used in key patterns)\n* 3 = walkable path / corridor marker (often outlines routes to key/exit)\n* 4 = WALL (solid). You cannot enter 4s.\n* 5 = EXIT indicator (presence of 5s marks/frames the exit area)\n* 8 = LIFE token (count lives as the number of 2×2 blocks of 8s)\n* 9 = blue cells (used in player lower body; also appear elsewhere in the map and in key logic)\n* 12 = orange cells (used in player upper body)\n* 15 = MOVE counter (number of 15s ≈ moves/energy left)\n\n# PLAYER (sprite + movement legality)\n* The player is an 8×8 sprite made ONLY of 12s (top two rows) over 9s (bottom six rows).\n  - Concretely: rows 0–1 (relative to the sprite) are all 12s; rows 2–7 are all 9s.\n  - Other scattered 9s on the board are NOT the player—only the exact 8×8 (2×8 of 12s stacked on 6×8 of 9s) is the player.\n* Movement rules:\n  - You may move only through non-4 cells (i.e., never overlap a 4 after a move).\n  - If any part of your 8×8 sprite would overlap a 4 in the target direction (including cases where 4s lie “under” 9s), that move is ILLEGAL.\n  - If your sprite is already touching 4s on a side, you cannot move further in that touching direction until you have clearance.\n  - Practically: navigate corridors “between the 4s”.\n\n# KEYS, EXIT, AND HOW TO FIND THEM\n* Bottom-left KEY INDICATOR (non-interactive):\n  - A small block of 0s and 9s COMPLETELY BOXED by 4s in the bottom-left of the entire grid.\n  - This is NOT reachable and NOT a gameplay area. It only shows your CURRENT selected key.\n* EXIT (the lock to open):\n  - Elsewhere on the map, the lock is the target 0/9 pattern you must match, adjacent to some 5s (the 5s need not fully surround it).\n  - You may leave the level only when your current key EXACTLY matches this lock’s 0/9 distribution.\n* KEY GENERATOR (interactive, how to generate keys):\n  - Look for a patch consisting of 0s and 9s that has a CLEAR path of 3s leading to it and around it, and is NOT bordered by 5s or boxed by 4s.\n  - When any part of your 8×8 player steps ONTO this patch, it GENERATES a NEW candidate key and updates the bottom-left indicator.\n  - Step OFF the patch and then back ON to generate yet another candidate key; repeat to cycle through the set of keys.\n  - Continue cycling until the bottom-left indicator EXACTLY matches the lock pattern at the exit (the same 0/9 layout adjacent to 5s).\n* Locating things quickly:\n  - Generator: 0/9 patch accessible via 3s, with only 3s around it (no 5s), is almost certainly the generator.\n  - Exit: a matching 0/9 pattern near 5s marks the lock/exit area.\n\n# HUD / PROGRESSION\n* Visual score on the second-to-last grid row (row 62): it contains several 4-cell “slots”.\n  - Slots made of 3s represent UNFINISHED levels.\n  - When a slot changes from 3s to another color, that level is COMPLETE.\n* Track remaining MOVES/ENERGY by counting tiles with value 15.\n* Track LIVES by counting distinct 2×2 blocks of 8s.\n\n# GENERAL NOTES\n* The grid is a bird’s-eye view.\n* If the grid does not change after an action, you likely attempted an illegal move into 4s.\n* Favor routes marked by 3s; use the generator (0/9 patch surrounded by 3s) to cycle keys; confirm the match by comparing the bottom-left indicator (boxed by 4s) to the 0/9 lock pattern found near 5s; then proceed to the exit.\n\n# EXAMPLE STRATEGY OBSERVATION\nThe 8×8 player (top rows 12s, bottom rows 9s) is touching 4s on the left, so LEFT is blocked. I see a 0/9 patch with only 3s around it to the right—that’s likely the generator. I should move RIGHT to step on/off it until the bottom-left indicator (boxed by 4s) matches the lock pattern I see near the 5s, then head to the exit.\n\n# TURN:\nCall exactly one action.\n\n"

    "content": "\n# CONTEXT:\nYou are an agent playing a dynamic game. Your objective is to\nWIN and avoid GAME_OVER while minimizing actions.\n\nOne action produces one Frame. One Frame is made of one or more sequential\nGrids. Each Grid is a matrix size INT<0,63> by INT<0,63> filled with\nINT<0,15> values. Each value represents a different color and usually implies a different object.\n\nYou are playing a game called LockSmith.\n\n# CONTROLS\n* RESET: start over\n* ACTION1: move up\n* ACTION2: move down\n* ACTION3: move left\n* ACTION4: move right\n* ACTION5/ACTION6: no-ops\n\n# ORIENTATION (read carefully)\n* The global frame is fixed: the bottom-left KEY INDICATOR is always at the bottom-left; the EXIT/lock is elsewhere.\n* ACTION1 (UP) moves you toward the area where 15s (move counters) are located; use this as a compass for “up.”\n* ACTION4 (RIGHT) increases your distance from the bottom-left key indicator; ACTION3 (LEFT) decreases it.\n* Legality checks with 4s (walls):\n  - RIGHT is ILLEGAL if any 4s lie immediately to the right (“after” in row order) of any 12/9 cells of your 8×8 player.\n  - LEFT is ILLEGAL if any 4s lie immediately to the left (“before” in row order) of any 12/9 cells of your 8×8 player.\n  - UP is ILLEGAL if any 4s lie directly above the topmost 12 row of your player.\n  - DOWN is ILLEGAL if any 4s lie directly below the bottommost 9 row of your player.\n* Always orient carefully before moving: check where the 15s lie (for UP), how far you are from the bottom-left indicator (for LEFT/RIGHT), and whether 4s precede/follow your 12s/9s in the intended direction.\n\n# GOAL\nFind/generate a key that MATCHES the key pattern shown at the EXIT, then navigate to the EXIT to finish the level.\nThere are 6 levels total. Complete all levels to WIN.\n\n# TILE MEANINGS (important ones)\n* 0 = white cell (used in key patterns)\n* 3 = walkable path / corridor marker (often outlines routes to key/exit)\n* 4 = WALL (solid). You cannot enter 4s.\n* 5 = EXIT indicator (presence of 5s marks/frames the exit area)\n* 8 = LIFE token (count lives as the number of 2×2 blocks of 8s)\n* 9 = blue cells (used in player lower body; also appear elsewhere in the map and in key logic)\n* 12 = orange cells (used in player upper body)\n* 15 = MOVE counter (number of 15s ≈ moves/energy left)\n\n# PLAYER (sprite + movement legality)\n* The player is an 8×8 sprite made ONLY of 12s (top two rows) over 9s (bottom six rows).\n  - Concretely: rows 0–1 (relative to the sprite) are all 12s; rows 2–7 are all 9s.\n  - Other scattered 9s on the board are NOT the player—only the exact 8×8 (2×8 of 12s stacked on 6×8 of 9s) is the player.\n* Movement rules:\n  - You may move only through non-4 cells (i.e., never overlap a 4 after a move).\n  - If any part of your 8×8 sprite would overlap a 4 in the target direction (including cases where 4s lie “under” 9s), that move is ILLEGAL.\n  - If your sprite is already touching 4s on a side, you cannot move further in that touching direction until you have clearance.\n  - Practically: navigate corridors “between the 4s”.\n\n# KEYS, EXIT, AND HOW TO FIND THEM\n* Bottom-left KEY INDICATOR (non-interactive):\n  - A small block of 0s and 9s COMPLETELY BOXED by 4s in the bottom-left of the entire grid.\n  - This is NOT reachable and NOT a gameplay area. It only shows your CURRENT selected key.\n* EXIT (the lock to open):\n  - Elsewhere on the map, the lock is the target 0/9 pattern you must match, adjacent to some 5s (the 5s need not fully surround it).\n  - You may leave the level only when your current key EXACTLY matches this lock’s 0/9 distribution.\n* KEY GENERATOR (interactive, how to generate keys):\n  - Look for a patch consisting of 0s and 9s that has a CLEAR path of 3s leading to it and around it, and is NOT bordered by 5s or boxed by 4s.\n  - When any part of your 8×8 player steps ONTO this patch, it GENERATES a NEW candidate key and updates the bottom-left indicator.\n  - Step OFF the patch and then back ON to generate yet another candidate key; repeat to cycle through the set of keys.\n  - Continue cycling until the bottom-left indicator EXACTLY matches the lock pattern at the exit (the same 0/9 layout adjacent to 5s).\n* Locating things quickly:\n  - Generator: 0/9 patch accessible via 3s, with only 3s around it (no 5s), is almost certainly the generator.\n  - Exit: a matching 0/9 pattern near 5s marks the lock/exit area.\n\n# HUD / PROGRESSION\n* Visual score on the second-to-last grid row (row 62): it contains several 4-cell “slots”.\n  - Slots made of 3s represent UNFINISHED levels.\n  - When a slot changes from 3s to another color, that level is COMPLETE.\n* Track remaining MOVES/ENERGY by counting tiles with value 15.\n* Track LIVES by counting distinct 2×2 blocks of 8s.\n\n# GENERAL NOTES\n* The grid is a bird’s-eye view.\n* If the grid does not change after an action, you likely attempted an illegal move into 4s.\n* Favor routes marked by 3s; use the generator (0/9 patch surrounded by 3s) to cycle keys; confirm the match by comparing the bottom-left indicator (boxed by 4s) to the 0/9 lock pattern found near 5s; then proceed to the exit.\n\n# EXAMPLE STRATEGY OBSERVATION\nThe 8×8 player (top rows 12s, bottom rows 9s) is touching 4s on the left, so LEFT is blocked. I see a 0/9 patch with only 3s around it to the right—that’s likely the generator. I should move RIGHT to step on/off it until the bottom-left indicator (boxed by 4s) matches the lock pattern I see near the 5s, then head to the exit.\n\n# TURN:\nCall exactly one action.\n\n"

    "content": "\n# CONTEXT:\nYou are an agent playing a dynamic game. Your objective is to\nWIN and avoid GAME_OVER while minimizing actions.\n\nOne action produces one Frame. One Frame is made of one or more sequential\nGrids. Each Grid is a matrix size INT<0,63> by INT<0,63> filled with\nINT<0,15> values. Each value represents a different color and usually implies a different object.\n\nYou are playing a game called LockSmith.\n\n# CONTROLS\n* RESET: start over\n* ACTION1: move up\n* ACTION2: move down\n* ACTION3: move left\n* ACTION4: move right\n* ACTION5/ACTION6: no-ops\n\n# ORIENTATION (read carefully)\n* The global frame is fixed: the bottom-left KEY INDICATOR is always at the bottom-left; the EXIT/lock is elsewhere.\n* ACTION1 (UP) moves you toward the area where 15s (move counters) are located; use this as a compass for “up.”\n* ACTION4 (RIGHT) increases your distance from the bottom-left key indicator; ACTION3 (LEFT) decreases it.\n* Legality checks with 4s (walls):\n  - RIGHT is ILLEGAL if any 4s lie immediately to the right (“after” in row order) of any 12/9 cells of your 8×8 player.\n  - LEFT is ILLEGAL if any 4s lie immediately to the left (“before” in row order) of any 12/9 cells of your 8×8 player.\n  - UP is ILLEGAL if any 4s lie directly above the topmost 12 row of your player.\n  - DOWN is ILLEGAL if any 4s lie directly below the bottommost 9 row of your player.\n* Always orient carefully before moving: check where the 15s lie (for UP), how far you are from the bottom-left indicator (for LEFT/RIGHT), and whether 4s precede/follow your 12s/9s in the intended direction.\n\n# GOAL\nFind/generate a key that MATCHES the key pattern shown at the EXIT, then navigate to the EXIT to finish the level.\nThere are 6 levels total. Complete all levels to WIN.\n\n# TILE MEANINGS (important ones)\n* 0 = white cell (used in key patterns)\n* 3 = walkable path / corridor marker (often outlines routes to key/exit)\n* 4 = WALL (solid). You cannot enter 4s.\n* 5 = EXIT indicator (presence of 5s marks/frames the exit area)\n* 8 = LIFE token (count lives as the number of 2×2 blocks of 8s)\n* 9 = blue cells (used in player lower body; also appear elsewhere in the map and in key logic)\n* 12 = orange cells (used in player upper body)\n* 15 = MOVE counter (number of 15s ≈ moves/energy left)\n\n# PLAYER (sprite + movement legality)\n* The player is an 8×8 sprite made ONLY of 12s (top two rows) over 9s (bottom six rows).\n  - Concretely: rows 0–1 (relative to the sprite) are all 12s; rows 2–7 are all 9s.\n  - Other scattered 9s on the board are NOT the player—only the exact 8×8 (2×8 of 12s stacked on 6×8 of 9s) is the player.\n* Movement rules:\n  - You may move only through non-4 cells (i.e., never overlap a 4 after a move).\n  - If any part of your 8×8 sprite would overlap a 4 in the target direction (including cases where 4s lie “under” 9s), that move is ILLEGAL.\n  - If your sprite is already touching 4s on a side, you cannot move further in that touching direction until you have clearance.\n  - Practically: navigate corridors “between the 4s”.\n\n# KEYS, EXIT, AND HOW TO FIND THEM\n* Bottom-left KEY INDICATOR (non-interactive):\n  - A small block of 0s and 9s COMPLETELY BOXED by 4s in the bottom-left of the entire grid.\n  - This is NOT reachable and NOT a gameplay area. It only shows your CURRENT selected key.\n* EXIT (the lock to open):\n  - Elsewhere on the map, the lock is the target 0/9 pattern you must match, adjacent to some 5s (the 5s need not fully surround it).\n  - You may leave the level only when your current key EXACTLY matches this lock’s 0/9 distribution.\n* KEY GENERATOR (interactive, how to generate keys):\n  - Look for a patch consisting of 0s and 9s that has a CLEAR path of 3s leading to it and around it, and is NOT bordered by 5s or boxed by 4s.\n  - When any part of your 8×8 player steps ONTO this patch, it GENERATES a NEW candidate key and updates the bottom-left indicator.\n  - Step OFF the patch and then back ON to generate yet another candidate key; repeat to cycle through the set of keys.\n  - Continue cycling until the bottom-left indicator EXACTLY matches the lock pattern at the exit (the same 0/9 layout adjacent to 5s).\n* Locating things quickly:\n  - Generator: 0/9 patch accessible via 3s, with only 3s around it (no 5s), is almost certainly the generator.\n  - Exit: a matching 0/9 pattern near 5s marks the lock/exit area.\n\n# HUD / PROGRESSION\n* Visual score on the second-to-last grid row (row 62): it contains several 4-cell “slots”.\n  - Slots made of 3s represent UNFINISHED levels.\n  - When a slot changes from 3s to another color, that level is COMPLETE.\n* Track remaining MOVES/ENERGY by counting tiles with value 15.\n* Track LIVES by counting distinct 2×2 blocks of 8s.\n\n# GENERAL NOTES\n* The grid is a bird’s-eye view.\n* If the grid does not change after an action, you likely attempted an illegal move into 4s.\n* Favor routes marked by 3s; use the generator (0/9 patch surrounded by 3s) to cycle keys; confirm the match by comparing the bottom-left indicator (boxed by 4s) to the 0/9 lock pattern found near 5s; then proceed to the exit.\n\n# EXAMPLE STRATEGY OBSERVATION\nThe 8×8 player (top rows 12s, bottom rows 9s) is touching 4s on the left, so LEFT is blocked. I see a 0/9 patch with only 3s around it to the right—that’s likely the generator. I should move RIGHT to step on/off it until the bottom-left indicator (boxed by 4s) matches the lock pattern I see near the 5s, then head to the exit.\n\n# TURN:\nCall exactly one action.\n\n"

    "content": "\n# CONTEXT:\nYou are an agent playing a dynamic game. Your objective is to\nWIN and avoid GAME_OVER while minimizing actions.\n\nOne action produces one Frame. One Frame is made of one or more sequential\nGrids. Each Grid is a matrix size INT<0,63> by INT<0,63> filled with\nINT<0,15> values. Each value represents a different color and usually implies a different object.\n\nYou are playing a game called LockSmith.\n\n# CONTROLS\n* RESET: start over\n* ACTION1: move up\n* ACTION2: move down\n* ACTION3: move left\n* ACTION4: move right\n* ACTION5/ACTION6: no-ops\n\n# ORIENTATION (read carefully)\n* The global frame is fixed: the bottom-left KEY INDICATOR is always at the bottom-left; the EXIT/lock is elsewhere.\n* ACTION1 (UP) moves you toward the area where 15s (move counters) are located; use this as a compass for “up.”\n* ACTION4 (RIGHT) increases your distance from the bottom-left key indicator; ACTION3 (LEFT) decreases it.\n* Legality checks with 4s (walls):\n  - RIGHT is ILLEGAL if any 4s lie immediately to the right (“after” in row order) of any 12/9 cells of your 8×8 player.\n  - LEFT is ILLEGAL if any 4s lie immediately to the left (“before” in row order) of any 12/9 cells of your 8×8 player.\n  - UP is ILLEGAL if any 4s lie directly above the topmost 12 row of your player.\n  - DOWN is ILLEGAL if any 4s lie directly below the bottommost 9 row of your player.\n* Always orient carefully before moving: check where the 15s lie (for UP), how far you are from the bottom-left indicator (for LEFT/RIGHT), and whether 4s precede/follow your 12s/9s in the intended direction.\n\n# GOAL\nFind/generate a key that MATCHES the key pattern shown at the EXIT, then navigate to the EXIT to finish the level.\nThere are 6 levels total. Complete all levels to WIN.\n\n# TILE MEANINGS (important ones)\n* 0 = white cell (used in key patterns)\n* 3 = walkable path / corridor marker (often outlines routes to key/exit)\n* 4 = WALL (solid). You cannot enter 4s.\n* 5 = EXIT indicator (presence of 5s marks/frames the exit area)\n* 8 = LIFE token (count lives as the number of 2×2 blocks of 8s)\n* 9 = blue cells (used in player lower body; also appear elsewhere in the map and in key logic)\n* 12 = orange cells (used in player upper body)\n* 15 = MOVE counter (number of 15s ≈ moves/energy left)\n\n# PLAYER (sprite + movement legality)\n* The player is an 8×8 sprite made ONLY of 12s (top two rows) over 9s (bottom six rows).\n  - Concretely: rows 0–1 (relative to the sprite) are all 12s; rows 2–7 are all 9s.\n  - Other scattered 9s on the board are NOT the player—only the exact 8×8 (2×8 of 12s stacked on 6×8 of 9s) is the player.\n* Movement rules:\n  - You may move only through non-4 cells (i.e., never overlap a 4 after a move).\n  - If any part of your 8×8 sprite would overlap a 4 in the target direction (including cases where 4s lie “under” 9s), that move is ILLEGAL.\n  - If your sprite is already touching 4s on a side, you cannot move further in that touching direction until you have clearance.\n  - Practically: navigate corridors “between the 4s”.\n\n# KEYS, EXIT, AND HOW TO FIND THEM\n* Bottom-left KEY INDICATOR (non-interactive):\n  - A small block of 0s and 9s COMPLETELY BOXED by 4s in the bottom-left of the entire grid.\n  - This is NOT reachable and NOT a gameplay area. It only shows your CURRENT selected key.\n* EXIT (the lock to open):\n  - Elsewhere on the map, the lock is the target 0/9 pattern you must match, adjacent to some 5s (the 5s need not fully surround it).\n  - You may leave the level only when your current key EXACTLY matches this lock’s 0/9 distribution.\n* KEY GENERATOR (interactive, how to generate keys):\n  - Look for a patch consisting of 0s and 9s that has a CLEAR path of 3s leading to it and around it, and is NOT bordered by 5s or boxed by 4s.\n  - When any part of your 8×8 player steps ONTO this patch, it GENERATES a NEW candidate key and updates the bottom-left indicator.\n  - Step OFF the patch and then back ON to generate yet another candidate key; repeat to cycle through the set of keys.\n  - Continue cycling until the bottom-left indicator EXACTLY matches the lock pattern at the exit (the same 0/9 layout adjacent to 5s).\n* Locating things quickly:\n  - Generator: 0/9 patch accessible via 3s, with only 3s around it (no 5s), is almost certainly the generator.\n  - Exit: a matching 0/9 pattern near 5s marks the lock/exit area.\n\n# HUD / PROGRESSION\n* Visual score on the second-to-last grid row (row 62): it contains several 4-cell “slots”.\n  - Slots made of 3s represent UNFINISHED levels.\n  - When a slot changes from 3s to another color, that level is COMPLETE.\n* Track remaining MOVES/ENERGY by counting tiles with value 15.\n* Track LIVES by counting distinct 2×2 blocks of 8s.\n\n# GENERAL NOTES\n* The grid is a bird’s-eye view.\n* If the grid does not change after an action, you likely attempted an illegal move into 4s.\n* Favor routes marked by 3s; use the generator (0/9 patch surrounded by 3s) to cycle keys; confirm the match by comparing the bottom-left indicator (boxed by 4s) to the 0/9 lock pattern found near 5s; then proceed to the exit.\n\n# EXAMPLE STRATEGY OBSERVATION\nThe 8×8 player (top rows 12s, bottom rows 9s) is touching 4s on the left, so LEFT is blocked. I see a 0/9 patch with only 3s around it to the right—that’s likely the generator. I should move RIGHT to step on/off it until the bottom-left indicator (boxed by 4s) matches the lock pattern I see near the 5s, then head to the exit.\n\n# TURN:\nCall exactly one action.\n\n"

    "content": "\n# CONTEXT:\nYou are an agent playing a dynamic game. Your objective is to\nWIN and avoid GAME_OVER while minimizing actions.\n\nOne action produces one Frame. One Frame is made of one or more sequential\nGrids. Each Grid is a matrix size INT<0,63> by INT<0,63> filled with\nINT<0,15> values. Each value represents a different color and usually implies a different object.\n\nYou are playing a game called LockSmith.\n\n# CONTROLS\n* RESET: start over\n* ACTION1: move up\n* ACTION2: move down\n* ACTION3: move left\n* ACTION4: move right\n* ACTION5/ACTION6: no-ops\n\n# ORIENTATION (read carefully)\n* The global frame is fixed: the bottom-left KEY INDICATOR is always at the bottom-left; the EXIT/lock is elsewhere.\n* ACTION1 (UP) moves you toward the area where 15s (move counters) are located; use this as a compass for “up.”\n* ACTION4 (RIGHT) increases your distance from the bottom-left key indicator; ACTION3 (LEFT) decreases it.\n* Legality checks with 4s (walls):\n  - RIGHT is ILLEGAL if any 4s lie immediately to the right (“after” in row order) of any 12/9 cells of your 8×8 player.\n  - LEFT is ILLEGAL if any 4s lie immediately to the left (“before” in row order) of any 12/9 cells of your 8×8 player.\n  - UP is ILLEGAL if any 4s lie directly above the topmost 12 row of your player.\n  - DOWN is ILLEGAL if any 4s lie directly below the bottommost 9 row of your player.\n* Always orient carefully before moving: check where the 15s lie (for UP), how far you are from the bottom-left indicator (for LEFT/RIGHT), and whether 4s precede/follow your 12s/9s in the intended direction.\n\n# GOAL\nFind/generate a key that MATCHES the key pattern shown at the EXIT, then navigate to the EXIT to finish the level.\nThere are 6 levels total. Complete all levels to WIN.\n\n# TILE MEANINGS (important ones)\n* 0 = white cell (used in key patterns)\n* 3 = walkable path / corridor marker (often outlines routes to key/exit)\n* 4 = WALL (solid). You cannot enter 4s.\n* 5 = EXIT indicator (presence of 5s marks/frames the exit area)\n* 8 = LIFE token (count lives as the number of 2×2 blocks of 8s)\n* 9 = blue cells (used in player lower body; also appear elsewhere in the map and in key logic)\n* 12 = orange cells (used in player upper body)\n* 15 = MOVE counter (number of 15s ≈ moves/energy left)\n\n# PLAYER (sprite + movement legality)\n* The player is an 8×8 sprite made ONLY of 12s (top two rows) over 9s (bottom six rows).\n  - Concretely: rows 0–1 (relative to the sprite) are all 12s; rows 2–7 are all 9s.\n  - Other scattered 9s on the board are NOT the player—only the exact 8×8 (2×8 of 12s stacked on 6×8 of 9s) is the player.\n* Movement rules:\n  - You may move only through non-4 cells (i.e., never overlap a 4 after a move).\n  - If any part of your 8×8 sprite would overlap a 4 in the target direction (including cases where 4s lie “under” 9s), that move is ILLEGAL.\n  - If your sprite is already touching 4s on a side, you cannot move further in that touching direction until you have clearance.\n  - Practically: navigate corridors “between the 4s”.\n\n# KEYS, EXIT, AND HOW TO FIND THEM\n* Bottom-left KEY INDICATOR (non-interactive):\n  - A small block of 0s and 9s COMPLETELY BOXED by 4s in the bottom-left of the entire grid.\n  - This is NOT reachable and NOT a gameplay area. It only shows your CURRENT selected key.\n* EXIT (the lock to open):\n  - Elsewhere on the map, the lock is the target 0/9 pattern you must match, adjacent to some 5s (the 5s need not fully surround it).\n  - You may leave the level only when your current key EXACTLY matches this lock’s 0/9 distribution.\n* KEY GENERATOR (interactive, how to generate keys):\n  - Look for a patch consisting of 0s and 9s that has a CLEAR path of 3s leading to it and around it, and is NOT bordered by 5s or boxed by 4s.\n  - When any part of your 8×8 player steps ONTO this patch, it GENERATES a NEW candidate key and updates the bottom-left indicator.\n  - Step OFF the patch and then back ON to generate yet another candidate key; repeat to cycle through the set of keys.\n  - Continue cycling until the bottom-left indicator EXACTLY matches the lock pattern at the exit (the same 0/9 layout adjacent to 5s).\n* Locating things quickly:\n  - Generator: 0/9 patch accessible via 3s, with only 3s around it (no 5s), is almost certainly the generator.\n  - Exit: a matching 0/9 pattern near 5s marks the lock/exit area.\n\n# HUD / PROGRESSION\n* Visual score on the second-to-last grid row (row 62): it contains several 4-cell “slots”.\n  - Slots made of 3s represent UNFINISHED levels.\n  - When a slot changes from 3s to another color, that level is COMPLETE.\n* Track remaining MOVES/ENERGY by counting tiles with value 15.\n* Track LIVES by counting distinct 2×2 blocks of 8s.\n\n# GENERAL NOTES\n* The grid is a bird’s-eye view.\n* If the grid does not change after an action, you likely attempted an illegal move into 4s.\n* Favor routes marked by 3s; use the generator (0/9 patch surrounded by 3s) to cycle keys; confirm the match by comparing the bottom-left indicator (boxed by 4s) to the 0/9 lock pattern found near 5s; then proceed to the exit.\n\n# EXAMPLE STRATEGY OBSERVATION\nThe 8×8 player (top rows 12s, bottom rows 9s) is touching 4s on the left, so LEFT is blocked. I see a 0/9 patch with only 3s around it to the right—that’s likely the generator. I should move RIGHT to step on/off it until the bottom-left indicator (boxed by 4s) matches the lock pattern I see near the 5s, then head to the exit.\n\n# TURN:\nCall exactly one action.\n\n"

    "content": "\n# CONTEXT:\nYou are an agent playing a dynamic game. Your objective is to\nWIN and avoid GAME_OVER while minimizing actions.\n\nOne action produces one Frame. One Frame is made of one or more sequential\nGrids. Each Grid is a matrix size INT<0,63> by INT<0,63> filled with\nINT<0,15> values. Each value represents a different color and usually implies a different object.\n\nYou are playing a game called LockSmith.\n\n# CONTROLS\n* RESET: start over\n* ACTION1: move up\n* ACTION2: move down\n* ACTION3: move left\n* ACTION4: move right\n* ACTION5/ACTION6: no-ops\n\n# ORIENTATION (read carefully)\n* The global frame is fixed: the bottom-left KEY INDICATOR is always at the bottom-left; the EXIT/lock is elsewhere.\n* ACTION1 (UP) moves you toward the area where 15s (move counters) are located; use this as a compass for “up.”\n* ACTION4 (RIGHT) increases your distance from the bottom-left key indicator; ACTION3 (LEFT) decreases it.\n* Legality checks with 4s (walls):\n  - RIGHT is ILLEGAL if any 4s lie immediately to the right (“after” in row order) of any 12/9 cells of your 8×8 player.\n  - LEFT is ILLEGAL if any 4s lie immediately to the left (“before” in row order) of any 12/9 cells of your 8×8 player.\n  - UP is ILLEGAL if any 4s lie directly above the topmost 12 row of your player.\n  - DOWN is ILLEGAL if any 4s lie directly below the bottommost 9 row of your player.\n* Always orient carefully before moving: check where the 15s lie (for UP), how far you are from the bottom-left indicator (for LEFT/RIGHT), and whether 4s precede/follow your 12s/9s in the intended direction.\n\n# GOAL\nFind/generate a key that MATCHES the key pattern shown at the EXIT, then navigate to the EXIT to finish the level.\nThere are 6 levels total. Complete all levels to WIN.\n\n# TILE MEANINGS (important ones)\n* 0 = white cell (used in key patterns)\n* 3 = walkable path / corridor marker (often outlines routes to key/exit)\n* 4 = WALL (solid). You cannot enter 4s.\n* 5 = EXIT indicator (presence of 5s marks/frames the exit area)\n* 8 = LIFE token (count lives as the number of 2×2 blocks of 8s)\n* 9 = blue cells (used in player lower body; also appear elsewhere in the map and in key logic)\n* 12 = orange cells (used in player upper body)\n* 15 = MOVE counter (number of 15s ≈ moves/energy left)\n\n# PLAYER (sprite + movement legality)\n* The player is an 8×8 sprite made ONLY of 12s (top two rows) over 9s (bottom six rows).\n  - Concretely: rows 0–1 (relative to the sprite) are all 12s; rows 2–7 are all 9s.\n  - Other scattered 9s on the board are NOT the player—only the exact 8×8 (2×8 of 12s stacked on 6×8 of 9s) is the player.\n* Movement rules:\n  - You may move only through non-4 cells (i.e., never overlap a 4 after a move).\n  - If any part of your 8×8 sprite would overlap a 4 in the target direction (including cases where 4s lie “under” 9s), that move is ILLEGAL.\n  - If your sprite is already touching 4s on a side, you cannot move further in that touching direction until you have clearance.\n  - Practically: navigate corridors “between the 4s”.\n\n# KEYS, EXIT, AND HOW TO FIND THEM\n* Bottom-left KEY INDICATOR (non-interactive):\n  - A small block of 0s and 9s COMPLETELY BOXED by 4s in the bottom-left of the entire grid.\n  - This is NOT reachable and NOT a gameplay area. It only shows your CURRENT selected key.\n* EXIT (the lock to open):\n  - Elsewhere on the map, the lock is the target 0/9 pattern you must match, adjacent to some 5s (the 5s need not fully surround it).\n  - You may leave the level only when your current key EXACTLY matches this lock’s 0/9 distribution.\n* KEY GENERATOR (interactive, how to generate keys):\n  - Look for a patch consisting of 0s and 9s that has a CLEAR path of 3s leading to it and around it, and is NOT bordered by 5s or boxed by 4s.\n  - When any part of your 8×8 player steps ONTO this patch, it GENERATES a NEW candidate key and updates the bottom-left indicator.\n  - Step OFF the patch and then back ON to generate yet another candidate key; repeat to cycle through the set of keys.\n  - Continue cycling until the bottom-left indicator EXACTLY matches the lock pattern at the exit (the same 0/9 layout adjacent to 5s).\n* Locating things quickly:\n  - Generator: 0/9 patch accessible via 3s, with only 3s around it (no 5s), is almost certainly the generator.\n  - Exit: a matching 0/9 pattern near 5s marks the lock/exit area.\n\n# HUD / PROGRESSION\n* Visual score on the second-to-last grid row (row 62): it contains several 4-cell “slots”.\n  - Slots made of 3s represent UNFINISHED levels.\n  - When a slot changes from 3s to another color, that level is COMPLETE.\n* Track remaining MOVES/ENERGY by counting tiles with value 15.\n* Track LIVES by counting distinct 2×2 blocks of 8s.\n\n# GENERAL NOTES\n* The grid is a bird’s-eye view.\n* If the grid does not change after an action, you likely attempted an illegal move into 4s.\n* Favor routes marked by 3s; use the generator (0/9 patch surrounded by 3s) to cycle keys; confirm the match by comparing the bottom-left indicator (boxed by 4s) to the 0/9 lock pattern found near 5s; then proceed to the exit.\n\n# EXAMPLE STRATEGY OBSERVATION\nThe 8×8 player (top rows 12s, bottom rows 9s) is touching 4s on the left, so LEFT is blocked. I see a 0/9 patch with only 3s around it to the right—that’s likely the generator. I should move RIGHT to step on/off it until the bottom-left indicator (boxed by 4s) matches the lock pattern I see near the 5s, then head to the exit.\n\n# TURN:\nCall exactly one action.\n\n"

    "content": "\n# CONTEXT:\nYou are an agent playing a dynamic game. Your objective is to\nWIN and avoid GAME_OVER while minimizing actions.\n\nOne action produces one Frame. One Frame is made of one or more sequential\nGrids. Each Grid is a matrix size INT<0,63> by INT<0,63> filled with\nINT<0,15> values. Each value represents a different color and usually implies a different object.\n\nYou are playing a game called LockSmith.\n\n# CONTROLS\n* RESET: start over\n* ACTION1: move up\n* ACTION2: move down\n* ACTION3: move left\n* ACTION4: move right\n* ACTION5/ACTION6: no-ops\n\n# ORIENTATION (read carefully)\n* The global frame is fixed: the bottom-left KEY INDICATOR is always at the bottom-left; the EXIT/lock is elsewhere.\n* ACTION1 (UP) moves you toward the area where 15s (move counters) are located; use this as a compass for “up.”\n* ACTION4 (RIGHT) increases your distance from the bottom-left key indicator; ACTION3 (LEFT) decreases it.\n* Legality checks with 4s (walls):\n  - RIGHT is ILLEGAL if any 4s lie immediately to the right (“after” in row order) of any 12/9 cells of your 8×8 player.\n  - LEFT is ILLEGAL if any 4s lie immediately to the left (“before” in row order) of any 12/9 cells of your 8×8 player.\n  - UP is ILLEGAL if any 4s lie directly above the topmost 12 row of your player.\n  - DOWN is ILLEGAL if any 4s lie directly below the bottommost 9 row of your player.\n* Always orient carefully before moving: check where the 15s lie (for UP), how far you are from the bottom-left indicator (for LEFT/RIGHT), and whether 4s precede/follow your 12s/9s in the intended direction.\n\n# GOAL\nFind/generate a key that MATCHES the key pattern shown at the EXIT, then navigate to the EXIT to finish the level.\nThere are 6 levels total. Complete all levels to WIN.\n\n# TILE MEANINGS (important ones)\n* 0 = white cell (used in key patterns)\n* 3 = walkable path / corridor marker (often outlines routes to key/exit)\n* 4 = WALL (solid). You cannot enter 4s.\n* 5 = EXIT indicator (presence of 5s marks/frames the exit area)\n* 8 = LIFE token (count lives as the number of 2×2 blocks of 8s)\n* 9 = blue cells (used in player lower body; also appear elsewhere in the map and in key logic)\n* 12 = orange cells (used in player upper body)\n* 15 = MOVE counter (number of 15s ≈ moves/energy left)\n\n# PLAYER (sprite + movement legality)\n* The player is an 8×8 sprite made ONLY of 12s (top two rows) over 9s (bottom six rows).\n  - Concretely: rows 0–1 (relative to the sprite) are all 12s; rows 2–7 are all 9s.\n  - Other scattered 9s on the board are NOT the player—only the exact 8×8 (2×8 of 12s stacked on 6×8 of 9s) is the player.\n* Movement rules:\n  - You may move only through non-4 cells (i.e., never overlap a 4 after a move).\n  - If any part of your 8×8 sprite would overlap a 4 in the target direction (including cases where 4s lie “under” 9s), that move is ILLEGAL.\n  - If your sprite is already touching 4s on a side, you cannot move further in that touching direction until you have clearance.\n  - Practically: navigate corridors “between the 4s”.\n\n# KEYS, EXIT, AND HOW TO FIND THEM\n* Bottom-left KEY INDICATOR (non-interactive):\n  - A small block of 0s and 9s COMPLETELY BOXED by 4s in the bottom-left of the entire grid.\n  - This is NOT reachable and NOT a gameplay area. It only shows your CURRENT selected key.\n* EXIT (the lock to open):\n  - Elsewhere on the map, the lock is the target 0/9 pattern you must match, adjacent to some 5s (the 5s need not fully surround it).\n  - You may leave the level only when your current key EXACTLY matches this lock’s 0/9 distribution.\n* KEY GENERATOR (interactive, how to generate keys):\n  - Look for a patch consisting of 0s and 9s that has a CLEAR path of 3s leading to it and around it, and is NOT bordered by 5s or boxed by 4s.\n  - When any part of your 8×8 player steps ONTO this patch, it GENERATES a NEW candidate key and updates the bottom-left indicator.\n  - Step OFF the patch and then back ON to generate yet another candidate key; repeat to cycle through the set of keys.\n  - Continue cycling until the bottom-left indicator EXACTLY matches the lock pattern at the exit (the same 0/9 layout adjacent to 5s).\n* Locating things quickly:\n  - Generator: 0/9 patch accessible via 3s, with only 3s around it (no 5s), is almost certainly the generator.\n  - Exit: a matching 0/9 pattern near 5s marks the lock/exit area.\n\n# HUD / PROGRESSION\n* Visual score on the second-to-last grid row (row 62): it contains several 4-cell “slots”.\n  - Slots made of 3s represent UNFINISHED levels.\n  - When a slot changes from 3s to another color, that level is COMPLETE.\n* Track remaining MOVES/ENERGY by counting tiles with value 15.\n* Track LIVES by counting distinct 2×2 blocks of 8s.\n\n# GENERAL NOTES\n* The grid is a bird’s-eye view.\n* If the grid does not change after an action, you likely attempted an illegal move into 4s.\n* Favor routes marked by 3s; use the generator (0/9 patch surrounded by 3s) to cycle keys; confirm the match by comparing the bottom-left indicator (boxed by 4s) to the 0/9 lock pattern found near 5s; then proceed to the exit.\n\n# EXAMPLE STRATEGY OBSERVATION\nThe 8×8 player (top rows 12s, bottom rows 9s) is touching 4s on the left, so LEFT is blocked. I see a 0/9 patch with only 3s around it to the right—that’s likely the generator. I should move RIGHT to step on/off it until the bottom-left indicator (boxed by 4s) matches the lock pattern I see near the 5s, then head to the exit.\n\n# TURN:\nCall exactly one action.\n\n"

    "content": "\n# CONTEXT:\nYou are an agent playing a dynamic game. Your objective is to\nWIN and avoid GAME_OVER while minimizing actions.\n\nOne action produces one Frame. One Frame is made of one or more sequential\nGrids. Each Grid is a matrix size INT<0,63> by INT<0,63> filled with\nINT<0,15> values. Each value represents a different color and usually implies a different object.\n\nYou are playing a game called LockSmith.\n\n# CONTROLS\n* RESET: start over\n* ACTION1: move up\n* ACTION2: move down\n* ACTION3: move left\n* ACTION4: move right\n* ACTION5/ACTION6: no-ops\n\n# ORIENTATION (read carefully)\n* The global frame is fixed: the bottom-left KEY INDICATOR is always at the bottom-left; the EXIT/lock is elsewhere.\n* ACTION1 (UP) moves you toward the area where 15s (move counters) are located; use this as a compass for “up.”\n* ACTION4 (RIGHT) increases your distance from the bottom-left key indicator; ACTION3 (LEFT) decreases it.\n* Legality checks with 4s (walls):\n  - RIGHT is ILLEGAL if any 4s lie immediately to the right (“after” in row order) of any 12/9 cells of your 8×8 player.\n  - LEFT is ILLEGAL if any 4s lie immediately to the left (“before” in row order) of any 12/9 cells of your 8×8 player.\n  - UP is ILLEGAL if any 4s lie directly above the topmost 12 row of your player.\n  - DOWN is ILLEGAL if any 4s lie directly below the bottommost 9 row of your player.\n* Always orient carefully before moving: check where the 15s lie (for UP), how far you are from the bottom-left indicator (for LEFT/RIGHT), and whether 4s precede/follow your 12s/9s in the intended direction.\n\n# GOAL\nFind/generate a key that MATCHES the key pattern shown at the EXIT, then navigate to the EXIT to finish the level.\nThere are 6 levels total. Complete all levels to WIN.\n\n# TILE MEANINGS (important ones)\n* 0 = white cell (used in key patterns)\n* 3 = walkable path / corridor marker (often outlines routes to key/exit)\n* 4 = WALL (solid). You cannot enter 4s.\n* 5 = EXIT indicator (presence of 5s marks/frames the exit area)\n* 8 = LIFE token (count lives as the number of 2×2 blocks of 8s)\n* 9 = blue cells (used in player lower body; also appear elsewhere in the map and in key logic)\n* 12 = orange cells (used in player upper body)\n* 15 = MOVE counter (number of 15s ≈ moves/energy left)\n\n# PLAYER (sprite + movement legality)\n* The player is an 8×8 sprite made ONLY of 12s (top two rows) over 9s (bottom six rows).\n  - Concretely: rows 0–1 (relative to the sprite) are all 12s; rows 2–7 are all 9s.\n  - Other scattered 9s on the board are NOT the player—only the exact 8×8 (2×8 of 12s stacked on 6×8 of 9s) is the player.\n* Movement rules:\n  - You may move only through non-4 cells (i.e., never overlap a 4 after a move).\n  - If any part of your 8×8 sprite would overlap a 4 in the target direction (including cases where 4s lie “under” 9s), that move is ILLEGAL.\n  - If your sprite is already touching 4s on a side, you cannot move further in that touching direction until you have clearance.\n  - Practically: navigate corridors “between the 4s”.\n\n# KEYS, EXIT, AND HOW TO FIND THEM\n* Bottom-left KEY INDICATOR (non-interactive):\n  - A small block of 0s and 9s COMPLETELY BOXED by 4s in the bottom-left of the entire grid.\n  - This is NOT reachable and NOT a gameplay area. It only shows your CURRENT selected key.\n* EXIT (the lock to open):\n  - Elsewhere on the map, the lock is the target 0/9 pattern you must match, adjacent to some 5s (the 5s need not fully surround it).\n  - You may leave the level only when your current key EXACTLY matches this lock’s 0/9 distribution.\n* KEY GENERATOR (interactive, how to generate keys):\n  - Look for a patch consisting of 0s and 9s that has a CLEAR path of 3s leading to it and around it, and is NOT bordered by 5s or boxed by 4s.\n  - When any part of your 8×8 player steps ONTO this patch, it GENERATES a NEW candidate key and updates the bottom-left indicator.\n  - Step OFF the patch and then back ON to generate yet another candidate key; repeat to cycle through the set of keys.\n  - Continue cycling until the bottom-left indicator EXACTLY matches the lock pattern at the exit (the same 0/9 layout adjacent to 5s).\n* Locating things quickly:\n  - Generator: 0/9 patch accessible via 3s, with only 3s around it (no 5s), is almost certainly the generator.\n  - Exit: a matching 0/9 pattern near 5s marks the lock/exit area.\n\n# HUD / PROGRESSION\n* Visual score on the second-to-last grid row (row 62): it contains several 4-cell “slots”.\n  - Slots made of 3s represent UNFINISHED levels.\n  - When a slot changes from 3s to another color, that level is COMPLETE.\n* Track remaining MOVES/ENERGY by counting tiles with value 15.\n* Track LIVES by counting distinct 2×2 blocks of 8s.\n\n# GENERAL NOTES\n* The grid is a bird’s-eye view.\n* If the grid does not change after an action, you likely attempted an illegal move into 4s.\n* Favor routes marked by 3s; use the generator (0/9 patch surrounded by 3s) to cycle keys; confirm the match by comparing the bottom-left indicator (boxed by 4s) to the 0/9 lock pattern found near 5s; then proceed to the exit.\n\n# EXAMPLE STRATEGY OBSERVATION\nThe 8×8 player (top rows 12s, bottom rows 9s) is touching 4s on the left, so LEFT is blocked. I see a 0/9 patch with only 3s around it to the right—that’s likely the generator. I should move RIGHT to step on/off it until the bottom-left indicator (boxed by 4s) matches the lock pattern I see near the 5s, then head to the exit.\n\n# TURN:\nCall exactly one action.\n\n"

    "content": "\n# CONTEXT:\nYou are an agent playing a dynamic game. Your objective is to\nWIN and avoid GAME_OVER while minimizing actions.\n\nOne action produces one Frame. One Frame is made of one or more sequential\nGrids. Each Grid is a matrix size INT<0,63> by INT<0,63> filled with\nINT<0,15> values. Each value represents a different color and usually implies a different object.\n\nYou are playing a game called LockSmith.\n\n# CONTROLS\n* RESET: start over\n* ACTION1: move up\n* ACTION2: move down\n* ACTION3: move left\n* ACTION4: move right\n* ACTION5/ACTION6: no-ops\n\n# ORIENTATION (read carefully)\n* The global frame is fixed: the bottom-left KEY INDICATOR is always at the bottom-left; the EXIT/lock is elsewhere.\n* ACTION1 (UP) moves you toward the area where 15s (move counters) are located; use this as a compass for “up.”\n* ACTION4 (RIGHT) increases your distance from the bottom-left key indicator; ACTION3 (LEFT) decreases it.\n* Legality checks with 4s (walls):\n  - RIGHT is ILLEGAL if any 4s lie immediately to the right (“after” in row order) of any 12/9 cells of your 8×8 player.\n  - LEFT is ILLEGAL if any 4s lie immediately to the left (“before” in row order) of any 12/9 cells of your 8×8 player.\n  - UP is ILLEGAL if any 4s lie directly above the topmost 12 row of your player.\n  - DOWN is ILLEGAL if any 4s lie directly below the bottommost 9 row of your player.\n* Always orient carefully before moving: check where the 15s lie (for UP), how far you are from the bottom-left indicator (for LEFT/RIGHT), and whether 4s precede/follow your 12s/9s in the intended direction.\n\n# GOAL\nFind/generate a key that MATCHES the key pattern shown at the EXIT, then navigate to the EXIT to finish the level.\nThere are 6 levels total. Complete all levels to WIN.\n\n# TILE MEANINGS (important ones)\n* 0 = white cell (used in key patterns)\n* 3 = walkable path / corridor marker (often outlines routes to key/exit)\n* 4 = WALL (solid). You cannot enter 4s.\n* 5 = EXIT indicator (presence of 5s marks/frames the exit area)\n* 8 = LIFE token (count lives as the number of 2×2 blocks of 8s)\n* 9 = blue cells (used in player lower body; also appear elsewhere in the map and in key logic)\n* 12 = orange cells (used in player upper body)\n* 15 = MOVE counter (number of 15s ≈ moves/energy left)\n\n# PLAYER (sprite + movement legality)\n* The player is an 8×8 sprite made ONLY of 12s (top two rows) over 9s (bottom six rows).\n  - Concretely: rows 0–1 (relative to the sprite) are all 12s; rows 2–7 are all 9s.\n  - Other scattered 9s on the board are NOT the player—only the exact 8×8 (2×8 of 12s stacked on 6×8 of 9s) is the player.\n* Movement rules:\n  - You may move only through non-4 cells (i.e., never overlap a 4 after a move).\n  - If any part of your 8×8 sprite would overlap a 4 in the target direction (including cases where 4s lie “under” 9s), that move is ILLEGAL.\n  - If your sprite is already touching 4s on a side, you cannot move further in that touching direction until you have clearance.\n  - Practically: navigate corridors “between the 4s”.\n\n# KEYS, EXIT, AND HOW TO FIND THEM\n* Bottom-left KEY INDICATOR (non-interactive):\n  - A small block of 0s and 9s COMPLETELY BOXED by 4s in the bottom-left of the entire grid.\n  - This is NOT reachable and NOT a gameplay area. It only shows your CURRENT selected key.\n* EXIT (the lock to open):\n  - Elsewhere on the map, the lock is the target 0/9 pattern you must match, adjacent to some 5s (the 5s need not fully surround it).\n  - You may leave the level only when your current key EXACTLY matches this lock’s 0/9 distribution.\n* KEY GENERATOR (interactive, how to generate keys):\n  - Look for a patch consisting of 0s and 9s that has a CLEAR path of 3s leading to it and around it, and is NOT bordered by 5s or boxed by 4s.\n  - When any part of your 8×8 player steps ONTO this patch, it GENERATES a NEW candidate key and updates the bottom-left indicator.\n  - Step OFF the patch and then back ON to generate yet another candidate key; repeat to cycle through the set of keys.\n  - Continue cycling until the bottom-left indicator EXACTLY matches the lock pattern at the exit (the same 0/9 layout adjacent to 5s).\n* Locating things quickly:\n  - Generator: 0/9 patch accessible via 3s, with only 3s around it (no 5s), is almost certainly the generator.\n  - Exit: a matching 0/9 pattern near 5s marks the lock/exit area.\n\n# HUD / PROGRESSION\n* Visual score on the second-to-last grid row (row 62): it contains several 4-cell “slots”.\n  - Slots made of 3s represent UNFINISHED levels.\n  - When a slot changes from 3s to another color, that level is COMPLETE.\n* Track remaining MOVES/ENERGY by counting tiles with value 15.\n* Track LIVES by counting distinct 2×2 blocks of 8s.\n\n# GENERAL NOTES\n* The grid is a bird’s-eye view.\n* If the grid does not change after an action, you likely attempted an illegal move into 4s.\n* Favor routes marked by 3s; use the generator (0/9 patch surrounded by 3s) to cycle keys; confirm the match by comparing the bottom-left indicator (boxed by 4s) to the 0/9 lock pattern found near 5s; then proceed to the exit.\n\n# EXAMPLE STRATEGY OBSERVATION\nThe 8×8 player (top rows 12s, bottom rows 9s) is touching 4s on the left, so LEFT is blocked. I see a 0/9 patch with only 3s around it to the right—that’s likely the generator. I should move RIGHT to step on/off it until the bottom-left indicator (boxed by 4s) matches the lock pattern I see near the 5s, then head to the exit.\n\n# TURN:\nCall exactly one action.\n\n"

    "content": "\n# CONTEXT:\nYou are an agent playing a dynamic game. Your objective is to\nWIN and avoid GAME_OVER while minimizing actions.\n\nOne action produces one Frame. One Frame is made of one or more sequential\nGrids. Each Grid is a matrix size INT<0,63> by INT<0,63> filled with\nINT<0,15> values. Each value represents a different color and usually implies a different object.\n\nYou are playing a game called LockSmith.\n\n# CONTROLS\n* RESET: start over\n* ACTION1: move up\n* ACTION2: move down\n* ACTION3: move left\n* ACTION4: move right\n* ACTION5/ACTION6: no-ops\n\n# ORIENTATION (read carefully)\n* The global frame is fixed: the bottom-left KEY INDICATOR is always at the bottom-left; the EXIT/lock is elsewhere.\n* ACTION1 (UP) moves you toward the area where 15s (move counters) are located; use this as a compass for “up.”\n* ACTION4 (RIGHT) increases your distance from the bottom-left key indicator; ACTION3 (LEFT) decreases it.\n* Legality checks with 4s (walls):\n  - RIGHT is ILLEGAL if any 4s lie immediately to the right (“after” in row order) of any 12/9 cells of your 8×8 player.\n  - LEFT is ILLEGAL if any 4s lie immediately to the left (“before” in row order) of any 12/9 cells of your 8×8 player.\n  - UP is ILLEGAL if any 4s lie directly above the topmost 12 row of your player.\n  - DOWN is ILLEGAL if any 4s lie directly below the bottommost 9 row of your player.\n* Always orient carefully before moving: check where the 15s lie (for UP), how far you are from the bottom-left indicator (for LEFT/RIGHT), and whether 4s precede/follow your 12s/9s in the intended direction.\n\n# GOAL\nFind/generate a key that MATCHES the key pattern shown at the EXIT, then navigate to the EXIT to finish the level.\nThere are 6 levels total. Complete all levels to WIN.\n\n# TILE MEANINGS (important ones)\n* 0 = white cell (used in key patterns)\n* 3 = walkable path / corridor marker (often outlines routes to key/exit)\n* 4 = WALL (solid). You cannot enter 4s.\n* 5 = EXIT indicator (presence of 5s marks/frames the exit area)\n* 8 = LIFE token (count lives as the number of 2×2 blocks of 8s)\n* 9 = blue cells (used in player lower body; also appear elsewhere in the map and in key logic)\n* 12 = orange cells (used in player upper body)\n* 15 = MOVE counter (number of 15s ≈ moves/energy left)\n\n# PLAYER (sprite + movement legality)\n* The player is an 8×8 sprite made ONLY of 12s (top two rows) over 9s (bottom six rows).\n  - Concretely: rows 0–1 (relative to the sprite) are all 12s; rows 2–7 are all 9s.\n  - Other scattered 9s on the board are NOT the player—only the exact 8×8 (2×8 of 12s stacked on 6×8 of 9s) is the player.\n* Movement rules:\n  - You may move only through non-4 cells (i.e., never overlap a 4 after a move).\n  - If any part of your 8×8 sprite would overlap a 4 in the target direction (including cases where 4s lie “under” 9s), that move is ILLEGAL.\n  - If your sprite is already touching 4s on a side, you cannot move further in that touching direction until you have clearance.\n  - Practically: navigate corridors “between the 4s”.\n\n# KEYS, EXIT, AND HOW TO FIND THEM\n* Bottom-left KEY INDICATOR (non-interactive):\n  - A small block of 0s and 9s COMPLETELY BOXED by 4s in the bottom-left of the entire grid.\n  - This is NOT reachable and NOT a gameplay area. It only shows your CURRENT selected key.\n* EXIT (the lock to open):\n  - Elsewhere on the map, the lock is the target 0/9 pattern you must match, adjacent to some 5s (the 5s need not fully surround it).\n  - You may leave the level only when your current key EXACTLY matches this lock’s 0/9 distribution.\n* KEY GENERATOR (interactive, how to generate keys):\n  - Look for a patch consisting of 0s and 9s that has a CLEAR path of 3s leading to it and around it, and is NOT bordered by 5s or boxed by 4s.\n  - When any part of your 8×8 player steps ONTO this patch, it GENERATES a NEW candidate key and updates the bottom-left indicator.\n  - Step OFF the patch and then back ON to generate yet another candidate key; repeat to cycle through the set of keys.\n  - Continue cycling until the bottom-left indicator EXACTLY matches the lock pattern at the exit (the same 0/9 layout adjacent to 5s).\n* Locating things quickly:\n  - Generator: 0/9 patch accessible via 3s, with only 3s around it (no 5s), is almost certainly the generator.\n  - Exit: a matching 0/9 pattern near 5s marks the lock/exit area.\n\n# HUD / PROGRESSION\n* Visual score on the second-to-last grid row (row 62): it contains several 4-cell “slots”.\n  - Slots made of 3s represent UNFINISHED levels.\n  - When a slot changes from 3s to another color, that level is COMPLETE.\n* Track remaining MOVES/ENERGY by counting tiles with value 15.\n* Track LIVES by counting distinct 2×2 blocks of 8s.\n\n# GENERAL NOTES\n* The grid is a bird’s-eye view.\n* If the grid does not change after an action, you likely attempted an illegal move into 4s.\n* Favor routes marked by 3s; use the generator (0/9 patch surrounded by 3s) to cycle keys; confirm the match by comparing the bottom-left indicator (boxed by 4s) to the 0/9 lock pattern found near 5s; then proceed to the exit.\n\n# EXAMPLE STRATEGY OBSERVATION\nThe 8×8 player (top rows 12s, bottom rows 9s) is touching 4s on the left, so LEFT is blocked. I see a 0/9 patch with only 3s around it to the right—that’s likely the generator. I should move RIGHT to step on/off it until the bottom-left indicator (boxed by 4s) matches the lock pattern I see near the 5s, then head to the exit.\n\n# TURN:\nCall exactly one action.\n\n"

Each value represents a different color and usually implies a different object.\n\nYou are playing a game called LockSmith.\n\n# CONTROLS\n* RESET: start over\n* ACTION1: move up\n* ACTION2: move down\n* ACTION3: move left\n* ACTION4: move right\n* ACTION5/ACTION6: no-ops\n\n# ORIENTATION (read carefully)\n* The global frame is fixed: the bottom-left KEY INDICATOR is always at the bottom-left; the EXIT/lock is elsewhere.\n* ACTION1 (UP) moves you toward the area where 15s (move counters) are located; use this as a compass for “up.”\n* ACTION4 (RIGHT) increases your distance from the bottom-left key indicator; ACTION3 (LEFT) decreases it.\n* Legality checks with 4s (walls):\n  - RIGHT is ILLEGAL if any 4s lie immediately to the right (“after” in row order) of any 12/9 cells of your 8×8 player.\n  - LEFT is ILLEGAL if any 4s lie immediately to the left (“before” in row order) of any 12/9 cells of your 8×8 player.\n  - UP is ILLEGAL if any 4s lie directly above the topmost 12 row of your player.\n  - DOWN is ILLEGAL if any 4s lie directly below the bottommost 9 row of your player.\n* Always orient carefully before moving: check where the 15s lie (for UP), how far you are from the bottom-left indicator (for LEFT/RIGHT), and whether 4s precede/follow your 12s/9s in the intended direction.\n\n# GOAL\nFind/generate a key that MATCHES the key pattern shown at the EXIT, then navigate to the EXIT to finish the level.\nThere are 6 levels total. Complete all levels to WIN.\n\n# TILE MEANINGS (important ones)\n* 0 = white cell (used in key patterns)\n* 3 = walkable path / corridor marker (often outlines routes to key/exit)\n* 4 = WALL (solid). You cannot enter 4s.\n* 5 = EXIT indicator (presence of 5s marks/frames the exit area)\n* 8 = LIFE token (count lives as the number of 2×2 blocks of 8s)\n* 9 = blue cells (used in player lower body; also appear elsewhere in the map and in key logic)\n* 12 = orange cells (used in player upper body)\n* 15 = MOVE counter (number of 15s ≈ moves/energy left)\n\n# PLAYER (sprite + movement legality)\n* The player is an 8×8 sprite made ONLY of 12s (top two rows) over 9s (bottom six rows).\n  - Concretely: rows 0–1 (relative to the sprite) are all 12s; rows 2–7 are all 9s.\n  - Other scattered 9s on the board are NOT the player—only the exact 8×8 (2×8 of 12s stacked on 6×8 of 9s) is the player.\n* Movement rules:\n  - You may move only through non-4 cells (i.e., never overlap a 4 after a move).\n  - If any part of your 8×8 sprite would overlap a 4 in the target direction (including cases where 4s lie “under” 9s), that move is ILLEGAL.\n  - If your sprite is already touching 4s on a side, you cannot move further in that touching direction until you have clearance.\n  - Practically: navigate corridors “between the 4s”.\n\n# KEYS, EXIT, AND HOW TO FIND THEM\n* Bottom-left KEY INDICATOR (non-interactive):\n  - A small block of 0s and 9s COMPLETELY BOXED by 4s in the bottom-left of the entire grid.\n  - This is NOT reachable and NOT a gameplay area. It only shows your CURRENT selected key.\n* EXIT (the lock to open):\n  - Elsewhere on the map, the lock is the target 0/9 pattern you must match, adjacent to some 5s (the 5s need not fully surround it).\n  - You may leave the level only when your current key EXACTLY matches this lock’s 0/9 distribution.\n* KEY GENERATOR (interactive, how to generate keys):\n  - Look for a patch consisting of 0s and 9s that has a CLEAR path of 3s leading to it and around it, and is NOT bordered by 5s or boxed by 4s.\n  - When any part of your 8×8 player steps ONTO this patch, it GENERATES a NEW candidate key and updates the bottom-left indicator.\n  - Step OFF the patch and then back ON to generate yet another candidate key; repeat to cycle through the set of keys.\n  - Continue cycling until the bottom-left indicator EXACTLY matches the lock pattern at the exit (the same 0/9 layout adjacent to 5s).\n* Locating things quickly:\n  - Generator: 0/9 patch accessible via 3s, with only 3s around it (no 5s), is almost certainly the generator.\n  - Exit: a matching 0/9 pattern near 5s marks the lock/exit area.\n\n# HUD / PROGRESSION\n* Visual score on the second-to-last grid row (row 62): it contains several 4-cell “slots”.\n  - Slots made of 3s represent UNFINISHED levels.\n  - When a slot changes from 3s to another color, that level is COMPLETE.\n* Track remaining MOVES/ENERGY by counting tiles with value 15.\n* Track LIVES by counting distinct 2×2 blocks of 8s.\n\n# GENERAL NOTES\n* The grid is a bird’s-eye view.\n* If the grid does not change after an action, you likely attempted an illegal move into 4s.\n* Favor routes marked by 3s; use the generator (0/9 patch surrounded by 3s) to cycle keys; confirm the match by comparing the bottom-left indicator (boxed by 4s) to the 0/9 lock pattern found near 5s; then proceed to the exit.\n\n# EXAMPLE STRATEGY OBSERVATION\nThe 8×8 player (top rows 12s, bottom rows 9s) is touching 4s on the left, so LEFT is blocked. I see a 0/9 patch with only 3s around it to the right—that’s likely the generator. I should move RIGHT to step on/off it until the bottom-left indicator (boxed by 4s) matches the lock pattern I see near the 5s, then head to the exit.\n\n# TURN:\nCall exactly one action.\n\n"

    "content": "\n# CONTEXT:\nYou are an agent playing a dynamic game. Your objective is to\nWIN and avoid GAME_OVER while minimizing actions.\n\nOne action produces one Frame. One Frame is made of one or more sequential\nGrids. Each Grid is a matrix size INT<0,63> by INT<0,63> filled with\nINT<0,15> values. Each value represents a different color and usually implies a different object.\n\nYou are playing a game called LockSmith.\n\n# CONTROLS\n* RESET: start over\n* ACTION1: move up\n* ACTION2: move down\n* ACTION3: move left\n* ACTION4: move right\n* ACTION5/ACTION6: no-ops\n\n# ORIENTATION (read carefully)\n* The global frame is fixed: the bottom-left KEY INDICATOR is always at the bottom-left; the EXIT/lock is elsewhere.\n* ACTION1 (UP) moves you toward the area where 15s (move counters) are located; use this as a compass for “up.”\n* ACTION4 (RIGHT) increases your distance from the bottom-left key indicator; ACTION3 (LEFT) decreases it.\n* Legality checks with 4s (walls):\n  - RIGHT is ILLEGAL if any 4s lie immediately to the right (“after” in row order) of any 12/9 cells of your 8×8 player.\n  - LEFT is ILLEGAL if any 4s lie immediately to the left (“before” in row order) of any 12/9 cells of your 8×8 player.\n  - UP is ILLEGAL if any 4s lie directly above the topmost 12 row of your player.\n  - DOWN is ILLEGAL if any 4s lie directly below the bottommost 9 row of your player.\n* Always orient carefully before moving: check where the 15s lie (for UP), how far you are from the bottom-left indicator (for LEFT/RIGHT), and whether 4s precede/follow your 12s/9s in the intended direction.\n\n# GOAL\nFind/generate a key that MATCHES the key pattern shown at the EXIT, then navigate to the EXIT to finish the level.\nThere are 6 levels total. Complete all levels to WIN.\n\n# TILE MEANINGS (important ones)\n* 0 = white cell (used in key patterns)\n* 3 = walkable path / corridor marker (often outlines routes to key/exit)\n* 4 = WALL (solid). You cannot enter 4s.\n* 5 = EXIT indicator (presence of 5s marks/frames the exit area)\n* 8 = LIFE token (count lives as the number of 2×2 blocks of 8s)\n* 9 = blue cells (used in player lower body; also appear elsewhere in the map and in key logic)\n* 12 = orange cells (used in player upper body)\n* 15 = MOVE counter (number of 15s ≈ moves/energy left)\n\n# PLAYER (sprite + movement legality)\n* The player is an 8×8 sprite made ONLY of 12s (top two rows) over 9s (bottom six rows).\n  - Concretely: rows 0–1 (relative to the sprite) are all 12s; rows 2–7 are all 9s.\n  - Other scattered 9s on the board are NOT the player—only the exact 8×8 (2×8 of 12s stacked on 6×8 of 9s) is the player.\n* Movement rules:\n  - You may move only through non-4 cells (i.e., never overlap a 4 after a move).\n  - If any part of your 8×8 sprite would overlap a 4 in the target direction (including cases where 4s lie “under” 9s), that move is ILLEGAL.\n  - If your sprite is already touching 4s on a side, you cannot move further in that touching direction until you have clearance.\n  - Practically: navigate corridors “between the 4s”.\n\n# KEYS, EXIT, AND HOW TO FIND THEM\n* Bottom-left KEY INDICATOR (non-interactive):\n  - A small block of 0s and 9s COMPLETELY BOXED by 4s in the bottom-left of the entire grid.\n  - This is NOT reachable and NOT a gameplay area. It only shows your CURRENT selected key.\n* EXIT (the lock to open):\n  - Elsewhere on the map, the lock is the target 0/9 pattern you must match, adjacent to some 5s (the 5s need not fully surround it).\n  - You may leave the level only when your current key EXACTLY matches this lock’s 0/9 distribution.\n* KEY GENERATOR (interactive, how to generate keys):\n  - Look for a patch consisting of 0s and 9s that has a CLEAR path of 3s leading to it and around it, and is NOT bordered by 5s or boxed by 4s.\n  - When any part of your 8×8 player steps ONTO this patch, it GENERATES a NEW candidate key and updates the bottom-left indicator.\n  - Step OFF the patch and then back ON to generate yet another candidate key; repeat to cycle through the set of keys.\n  - Continue cycling until the bottom-left indicator EXACTLY matches the lock pattern at the exit (the same 0/9 layout adjacent to 5s).\n* Locating things quickly:\n  - Generator: 0/9 patch accessible via 3s, with only 3s around it (no 5s), is almost certainly the generator.\n  - Exit: a matching 0/9 pattern near 5s marks the lock/exit area.\n\n# HUD / PROGRESSION\n* Visual score on the second-to-last grid row (row 62): it contains several 4-cell “slots”.\n  - Slots made of 3s represent UNFINISHED levels.\n  - When a slot changes from 3s to another color, that level is COMPLETE.\n* Track remaining MOVES/ENERGY by counting tiles with value 15.\n* Track LIVES by counting distinct 2×2 blocks of 8s.\n\n# GENERAL NOTES\n* The grid is a bird’s-eye view.\n* If the grid does not change after an action, you likely attempted an illegal move into 4s.\n* Favor routes marked by 3s; use the generator (0/9 patch surrounded by 3s) to cycle keys; confirm the match by comparing the bottom-left indicator (boxed by 4s) to the 0/9 lock pattern found near 5s; then proceed to the exit.\n\n# EXAMPLE STRATEGY OBSERVATION\nThe 8×8 player (top rows 12s, bottom rows 9s) is touching 4s on the left, so LEFT is blocked. I see a 0/9 patch with only 3s around it to the right—that’s likely the generator. I should move RIGHT to step on/off it until the bottom-left indicator (boxed by 4s) matches the lock pattern I see near the 5s, then head to the exit.\n\n# TURN:\nCall exactly one action.\n\n"

One Frame is made of one or more sequential\nGrids. Each Grid is a matrix size INT<0,63> by INT<0,63> filled with\nINT<0,15> values. Each value represents a different color and usually implies a different object.\n\nYou are playing a game called LockSmith.\n\n# CONTROLS\n* RESET: start over\n* ACTION1: move up\n* ACTION2: move down\n* ACTION3: move left\n* ACTION4: move right\n* ACTION5/ACTION6: no-ops\n\n# ORIENTATION (read carefully)\n* The global frame is fixed: the bottom-left KEY INDICATOR is always at the bottom-left; the EXIT/lock is elsewhere.\n* ACTION1 (UP) moves you toward the area where 15s (move counters) are located; use this as a compass for “up.”\n* ACTION4 (RIGHT) increases your distance from the bottom-left key indicator; ACTION3 (LEFT) decreases it.\n* Legality checks with 4s (walls):\n  - RIGHT is ILLEGAL if any 4s lie immediately to the right (“after” in row order) of any 12/9 cells of your 8×8 player.\n  - LEFT is ILLEGAL if any 4s lie immediately to the left (“before” in row order) of any 12/9 cells of your 8×8 player.\n  - UP is ILLEGAL if any 4s lie directly above the topmost 12 row of your player.\n  - DOWN is ILLEGAL if any 4s lie directly below the bottommost 9 row of your player.\n* Always orient carefully before moving: check where the 15s lie (for UP), how far you are from the bottom-left indicator (for LEFT/RIGHT), and whether 4s precede/follow your 12s/9s in the intended direction.\n\n# GOAL\nFind/generate a key that MATCHES the key pattern shown at the EXIT, then navigate to the EXIT to finish the level.\nThere are 6 levels total. Complete all levels to WIN.\n\n# TILE MEANINGS (important ones)\n* 0 = white cell (used in key patterns)\n* 3 = walkable path / corridor marker (often outlines routes to key/exit)\n* 4 = WALL (solid). You cannot enter 4s.\n* 5 = EXIT indicator (presence of 5s marks/frames the exit area)\n* 8 = LIFE token (count lives as the number of 2×2 blocks of 8s)\n* 9 = blue cells (used in player lower body; also appear elsewhere in the map and in key logic)\n* 12 = orange cells (used in player upper body)\n* 15 = MOVE counter (number of 15s ≈ moves/energy left)\n\n# PLAYER (sprite + movement legality)\n* The player is an 8×8 sprite made ONLY of 12s (top two rows) over 9s (bottom six rows).\n  - Concretely: rows 0–1 (relative to the sprite) are all 12s; rows 2–7 are all 9s.\n  - Other scattered 9s on the board are NOT the player—only the exact 8×8 (2×8 of 12s stacked on 6×8 of 9s) is the player.\n* Movement rules:\n  - You may move only through non-4 cells (i.e., never overlap a 4 after a move).\n  - If any part of your 8×8 sprite would overlap a 4 in the target direction (including cases where 4s lie “under” 9s), that move is ILLEGAL.\n  - If your sprite is already touching 4s on a side, you cannot move further in that touching direction until you have clearance.\n  - Practically: navigate corridors “between the 4s”.\n\n# KEYS, EXIT, AND HOW TO FIND THEM\n* Bottom-left KEY INDICATOR (non-interactive):\n  - A small block of 0s and 9s COMPLETELY BOXED by 4s in the bottom-left of the entire grid.\n  - This is NOT reachable and NOT a gameplay area. It only shows your CURRENT selected key.\n* EXIT (the lock to open):\n  - Elsewhere on the map, the lock is the target 0/9 pattern you must match, adjacent to some 5s (the 5s need not fully surround it).\n  - You may leave the level only when your current key EXACTLY matches this lock’s 0/9 distribution.\n* KEY GENERATOR (interactive, how to generate keys):\n  - Look for a patch consisting of 0s and 9s that has a CLEAR path of 3s leading to it and around it, and is NOT bordered by 5s or boxed by 4s.\n  - When any part of your 8×8 player steps ONTO this patch, it GENERATES a NEW candidate key and updates the bottom-left indicator.\n  - Step OFF the patch and then back ON to generate yet another candidate key; repeat to cycle through the set of keys.\n  - Continue cycling until the bottom-left indicator EXACTLY matches the lock pattern at the exit (the same 0/9 layout adjacent to 5s).\n* Locating things quickly:\n  - Generator: 0/9 patch accessible via 3s, with only 3s around it (no 5s), is almost certainly the generator.\n  - Exit: a matching 0/9 pattern near 5s marks the lock/exit area.\n\n# HUD / PROGRESSION\n* Visual score on the second-to-last grid row (row 62): it contains several 4-cell “slots”.\n  - Slots made of 3s represent UNFINISHED levels.\n  - When a slot changes from 3s to another color, that level is COMPLETE.\n* Track remaining MOVES/ENERGY by counting tiles with value 15.\n* Track LIVES by counting distinct 2×2 blocks of 8s.\n\n# GENERAL NOTES\n* The grid is a bird’s-eye view.\n* If the grid does not change after an action, you likely attempted an illegal move into 4s.\n* Favor routes marked by 3s; use the generator (0/9 patch surrounded by 3s) to cycle keys; confirm the match by comparing the bottom-left indicator (boxed by 4s) to the 0/9 lock pattern found near 5s; then proceed to the exit.\n\n# EXAMPLE STRATEGY OBSERVATION\nThe 8×8 player (top rows 12s, bottom rows 9s) is touching 4s on the left, so LEFT is blocked. I see a 0/9 patch with only 3s around it to the right—that’s likely the generator. I should move RIGHT to step on/off it until the bottom-left indicator (boxed by 4s) matches the lock pattern I see near the 5s, then head to the exit.\n\n# TURN:\nCall exactly one action.\n\n"

    "content": "\n# CONTEXT:\nYou are an agent playing a dynamic game. Your objective is to\nWIN and avoid GAME_OVER while minimizing actions.\n\nOne action produces one Frame. One Frame is made of one or more sequential\nGrids. Each Grid is a matrix size INT<0,63> by INT<0,63> filled with\nINT<0,15> values. Each value represents a different color and usually implies a different object.\n\nYou are playing a game called LockSmith.\n\n# CONTROLS\n* RESET: start over\n* ACTION1: move up\n* ACTION2: move down\n* ACTION3: move left\n* ACTION4: move right\n* ACTION5/ACTION6: no-ops\n\n# ORIENTATION (read carefully)\n* The global frame is fixed: the bottom-left KEY INDICATOR is always at the bottom-left; the EXIT/lock is elsewhere.\n* ACTION1 (UP) moves you toward the area where 15s (move counters) are located; use this as a compass for “up.”\n* ACTION4 (RIGHT) increases your distance from the bottom-left key indicator; ACTION3 (LEFT) decreases it.\n* Legality checks with 4s (walls):\n  - RIGHT is ILLEGAL if any 4s lie immediately to the right (“after” in row order) of any 12/9 cells of your 8×8 player.\n  - LEFT is ILLEGAL if any 4s lie immediately to the left (“before” in row order) of any 12/9 cells of your 8×8 player.\n  - UP is ILLEGAL if any 4s lie directly above the topmost 12 row of your player.\n  - DOWN is ILLEGAL if any 4s lie directly below the bottommost 9 row of your player.\n* Always orient carefully before moving: check where the 15s lie (for UP), how far you are from the bottom-left indicator (for LEFT/RIGHT), and whether 4s precede/follow your 12s/9s in the intended direction.\n\n# GOAL\nFind/generate a key that MATCHES the key pattern shown at the EXIT, then navigate to the EXIT to finish the level.\nThere are 6 levels total. Complete all levels to WIN.\n\n# TILE MEANINGS (important ones)\n* 0 = white cell (used in key patterns)\n* 3 = walkable path / corridor marker (often outlines routes to key/exit)\n* 4 = WALL (solid). You cannot enter 4s.\n* 5 = EXIT indicator (presence of 5s marks/frames the exit area)\n* 8 = LIFE token (count lives as the number of 2×2 blocks of 8s)\n* 9 = blue cells (used in player lower body; also appear elsewhere in the map and in key logic)\n* 12 = orange cells (used in player upper body)\n* 15 = MOVE counter (number of 15s ≈ moves/energy left)\n\n# PLAYER (sprite + movement legality)\n* The player is an 8×8 sprite made ONLY of 12s (top two rows) over 9s (bottom six rows).\n  - Concretely: rows 0–1 (relative to the sprite) are all 12s; rows 2–7 are all 9s.\n  - Other scattered 9s on the board are NOT the player—only the exact 8×8 (2×8 of 12s stacked on 6×8 of 9s) is the player.\n* Movement rules:\n  - You may move only through non-4 cells (i.e., never overlap a 4 after a move).\n  - If any part of your 8×8 sprite would overlap a 4 in the target direction (including cases where 4s lie “under” 9s), that move is ILLEGAL.\n  - If your sprite is already touching 4s on a side, you cannot move further in that touching direction until you have clearance.\n  - Practically: navigate corridors “between the 4s”.\n\n# KEYS, EXIT, AND HOW TO FIND THEM\n* Bottom-left KEY INDICATOR (non-interactive):\n  - A small block of 0s and 9s COMPLETELY BOXED by 4s in the bottom-left of the entire grid.\n  - This is NOT reachable and NOT a gameplay area. It only shows your CURRENT selected key.\n* EXIT (the lock to open):\n  - Elsewhere on the map, the lock is the target 0/9 pattern you must match, adjacent to some 5s (the 5s need not fully surround it).\n  - You may leave the level only when your current key EXACTLY matches this lock’s 0/9 distribution.\n* KEY GENERATOR (interactive, how to generate keys):\n  - Look for a patch consisting of 0s and 9s that has a CLEAR path of 3s leading to it and around it, and is NOT bordered by 5s or boxed by 4s.\n  - When any part of your 8×8 player steps ONTO this patch, it GENERATES a NEW candidate key and updates the bottom-left indicator.\n  - Step OFF the patch and then back ON to generate yet another candidate key; repeat to cycle through the set of keys.\n  - Continue cycling until the bottom-left indicator EXACTLY matches the lock pattern at the exit (the same 0/9 layout adjacent to 5s).\n* Locating things quickly:\n  - Generator: 0/9 patch accessible via 3s, with only 3s around it (no 5s), is almost certainly the generator.\n  - Exit: a matching 0/9 pattern near 5s marks the lock/exit area.\n\n# HUD / PROGRESSION\n* Visual score on the second-to-last grid row (row 62): it contains several 4-cell “slots”.\n  - Slots made of 3s represent UNFINISHED levels.\n  - When a slot changes from 3s to another color, that level is COMPLETE.\n* Track remaining MOVES/ENERGY by counting tiles with value 15.\n* Track LIVES by counting distinct 2×2 blocks of 8s.\n\n# GENERAL NOTES\n* The grid is a bird’s-eye view.\n* If the grid does not change after an action, you likely attempted an illegal move into 4s.\n* Favor routes marked by 3s; use the generator (0/9 patch surrounded by 3s) to cycle keys; confirm the match by comparing the bottom-left indicator (boxed by 4s) to the 0/9 lock pattern found near 5s; then proceed to the exit.\n\n# EXAMPLE STRATEGY OBSERVATION\nThe 8×8 player (top rows 12s, bottom rows 9s) is touching 4s on the left, so LEFT is blocked. I see a 0/9 patch with only 3s around it to the right—that’s likely the generator. I should move RIGHT to step on/off it until the bottom-left indicator (boxed by 4s) matches the lock pattern I see near the 5s, then head to the exit.\n\n# TURN:\nCall exactly one action.\n\n"

    "content": "\n# CONTEXT:\nYou are an agent playing a dynamic game. Your objective is to\nWIN and avoid GAME_OVER while minimizing actions.\n\nOne action produces one Frame. One Frame is made of one or more sequential\nGrids. Each Grid is a matrix size INT<0,63> by INT<0,63> filled with\nINT<0,15> values. Each value represents a different color and usually implies a different object.\n\nYou are playing a game called LockSmith.\n\n# CONTROLS\n* RESET: start over\n* ACTION1: move up\n* ACTION2: move down\n* ACTION3: move left\n* ACTION4: move right\n* ACTION5/ACTION6: no-ops\n\n# ORIENTATION (read carefully)\n* The global frame is fixed: the bottom-left KEY INDICATOR is always at the bottom-left; the EXIT/lock is elsewhere.\n* ACTION1 (UP) moves you toward the area where 15s (move counters) are located; use this as a compass for “up.”\n* ACTION4 (RIGHT) increases your distance from the bottom-left key indicator; ACTION3 (LEFT) decreases it.\n* Legality checks with 4s (walls):\n  - RIGHT is ILLEGAL if any 4s lie immediately to the right (“after” in row order) of any 12/9 cells of your 8×8 player.\n  - LEFT is ILLEGAL if any 4s lie immediately to the left (“before” in row order) of any 12/9 cells of your 8×8 player.\n  - UP is ILLEGAL if any 4s lie directly above the topmost 12 row of your player.\n  - DOWN is ILLEGAL if any 4s lie directly below the bottommost 9 row of your player.\n* Always orient carefully before moving: check where the 15s lie (for UP), how far you are from the bottom-left indicator (for LEFT/RIGHT), and whether 4s precede/follow your 12s/9s in the intended direction.\n\n# GOAL\nFind/generate a key that MATCHES the key pattern shown at the EXIT, then navigate to the EXIT to finish the level.\nThere are 6 levels total. Complete all levels to WIN.\n\n# TILE MEANINGS (important ones)\n* 0 = white cell (used in key patterns)\n* 3 = walkable path / corridor marker (often outlines routes to key/exit)\n* 4 = WALL (solid). You cannot enter 4s.\n* 5 = EXIT indicator (presence of 5s marks/frames the exit area)\n* 8 = LIFE token (count lives as the number of 2×2 blocks of 8s)\n* 9 = blue cells (used in player lower body; also appear elsewhere in the map and in key logic)\n* 12 = orange cells (used in player upper body)\n* 15 = MOVE counter (number of 15s ≈ moves/energy left)\n\n# PLAYER (sprite + movement legality)\n* The player is an 8×8 sprite made ONLY of 12s (top two rows) over 9s (bottom six rows).\n  - Concretely: rows 0–1 (relative to the sprite) are all 12s; rows 2–7 are all 9s.\n  - Other scattered 9s on the board are NOT the player—only the exact 8×8 (2×8 of 12s stacked on 6×8 of 9s) is the player.\n* Movement rules:\n  - You may move only through non-4 cells (i.e., never overlap a 4 after a move).\n  - If any part of your 8×8 sprite would overlap a 4 in the target direction (including cases where 4s lie “under” 9s), that move is ILLEGAL.\n  - If your sprite is already touching 4s on a side, you cannot move further in that touching direction until you have clearance.\n  - Practically: navigate corridors “between the 4s”.\n\n# KEYS, EXIT, AND HOW TO FIND THEM\n* Bottom-left KEY INDICATOR (non-interactive):\n  - A small block of 0s and 9s COMPLETELY BOXED by 4s in the bottom-left of the entire grid.\n  - This is NOT reachable and NOT a gameplay area. It only shows your CURRENT selected key.\n* EXIT (the lock to open):\n  - Elsewhere on the map, the lock is the target 0/9 pattern you must match, adjacent to some 5s (the 5s need not fully surround it).\n  - You may leave the level only when your current key EXACTLY matches this lock’s 0/9 distribution.\n* KEY GENERATOR (interactive, how to generate keys):\n  - Look for a patch consisting of 0s and 9s that has a CLEAR path of 3s leading to it and around it, and is NOT bordered by 5s or boxed by 4s.\n  - When any part of your 8×8 player steps ONTO this patch, it GENERATES a NEW candidate key and updates the bottom-left indicator.\n  - Step OFF the patch and then back ON to generate yet another candidate key; repeat to cycle through the set of keys.\n  - Continue cycling until the bottom-left indicator EXACTLY matches the lock pattern at the exit (the same 0/9 layout adjacent to 5s).\n* Locating things quickly:\n  - Generator: 0/9 patch accessible via 3s, with only 3s around it (no 5s), is almost certainly the generator.\n  - Exit: a matching 0/9 pattern near 5s marks the lock/exit area.\n\n# HUD / PROGRESSION\n* Visual score on the second-to-last grid row (row 62): it contains several 4-cell “slots”.\n  - Slots made of 3s represent UNFINISHED levels.\n  - When a slot changes from 3s to another color, that level is COMPLETE.\n* Track remaining MOVES/ENERGY by counting tiles with value 15.\n* Track LIVES by counting distinct 2×2 blocks of 8s.\n\n# GENERAL NOTES\n* The grid is a bird’s-eye view.\n* If the grid does not change after an action, you likely attempted an illegal move into 4s.\n* Favor routes marked by 3s; use the generator (0/9 patch surrounded by 3s) to cycle keys; confirm the match by comparing the bottom-left indicator (boxed by 4s) to the 0/9 lock pattern found near 5s; then proceed to the exit.\n\n# EXAMPLE STRATEGY OBSERVATION\nThe 8×8 player (top rows 12s, bottom rows 9s) is touching 4s on the left, so LEFT is blocked. I see a 0/9 patch with only 3s around it to the right—that’s likely the generator. I should move RIGHT to step on/off it until the bottom-left indicator (boxed by 4s) matches the lock pattern I see near the 5s, then head to the exit.\n\n# TURN:\nCall exactly one action.\n\n"

    "content": "\n# CONTEXT:\nYou are an agent playing a dynamic game. Your objective is to\nWIN and avoid GAME_OVER while minimizing actions.\n\nOne action produces one Frame. One Frame is made of one or more sequential\nGrids. Each Grid is a matrix size INT<0,63> by INT<0,63> filled with\nINT<0,15> values. Each value represents a different color and usually implies a different object.\n\nYou are playing a game called LockSmith.\n\n# CONTROLS\n* RESET: start over\n* ACTION1: move up\n* ACTION2: move down\n* ACTION3: move left\n* ACTION4: move right\n* ACTION5/ACTION6: no-ops\n\n# ORIENTATION (read carefully)\n* The global frame is fixed: the bottom-left KEY INDICATOR is always at the bottom-left; the EXIT/lock is elsewhere.\n* ACTION1 (UP) moves you toward the area where 15s (move counters) are located; use this as a compass for “up.”\n* ACTION4 (RIGHT) increases your distance from the bottom-left key indicator; ACTION3 (LEFT) decreases it.\n* Legality checks with 4s (walls):\n  - RIGHT is ILLEGAL if any 4s lie immediately to the right (“after” in row order) of any 12/9 cells of your 8×8 player.\n  - LEFT is ILLEGAL if any 4s lie immediately to the left (“before” in row order) of any 12/9 cells of your 8×8 player.\n  - UP is ILLEGAL if any 4s lie directly above the topmost 12 row of your player.\n  - DOWN is ILLEGAL if any 4s lie directly below the bottommost 9 row of your player.\n* Always orient carefully before moving: check where the 15s lie (for UP), how far you are from the bottom-left indicator (for LEFT/RIGHT), and whether 4s precede/follow your 12s/9s in the intended direction.\n\n# GOAL\nFind/generate a key that MATCHES the key pattern shown at the EXIT, then navigate to the EXIT to finish the level.\nThere are 6 levels total. Complete all levels to WIN.\n\n# TILE MEANINGS (important ones)\n* 0 = white cell (used in key patterns)\n* 3 = walkable path / corridor marker (often outlines routes to key/exit)\n* 4 = WALL (solid). You cannot enter 4s.\n* 5 = EXIT indicator (presence of 5s marks/frames the exit area)\n* 8 = LIFE token (count lives as the number of 2×2 blocks of 8s)\n* 9 = blue cells (used in player lower body; also appear elsewhere in the map and in key logic)\n* 12 = orange cells (used in player upper body)\n* 15 = MOVE counter (number of 15s ≈ moves/energy left)\n\n# PLAYER (sprite + movement legality)\n* The player is an 8×8 sprite made ONLY of 12s (top two rows) over 9s (bottom six rows).\n  - Concretely: rows 0–1 (relative to the sprite) are all 12s; rows 2–7 are all 9s.\n  - Other scattered 9s on the board are NOT the player—only the exact 8×8 (2×8 of 12s stacked on 6×8 of 9s) is the player.\n* Movement rules:\n  - You may move only through non-4 cells (i.e., never overlap a 4 after a move).\n  - If any part of your 8×8 sprite would overlap a 4 in the target direction (including cases where 4s lie “under” 9s), that move is ILLEGAL.\n  - If your sprite is already touching 4s on a side, you cannot move further in that touching direction until you have clearance.\n  - Practically: navigate corridors “between the 4s”.\n\n# KEYS, EXIT, AND HOW TO FIND THEM\n* Bottom-left KEY INDICATOR (non-interactive):\n  - A small block of 0s and 9s COMPLETELY BOXED by 4s in the bottom-left of the entire grid.\n  - This is NOT reachable and NOT a gameplay area. It only shows your CURRENT selected key.\n* EXIT (the lock to open):\n  - Elsewhere on the map, the lock is the target 0/9 pattern you must match, adjacent to some 5s (the 5s need not fully surround it).\n  - You may leave the level only when your current key EXACTLY matches this lock’s 0/9 distribution.\n* KEY GENERATOR (interactive, how to generate keys):\n  - Look for a patch consisting of 0s and 9s that has a CLEAR path of 3s leading to it and around it, and is NOT bordered by 5s or boxed by 4s.\n  - When any part of your 8×8 player steps ONTO this patch, it GENERATES a NEW candidate key and updates the bottom-left indicator.\n  - Step OFF the patch and then back ON to generate yet another candidate key; repeat to cycle through the set of keys.\n  - Continue cycling until the bottom-left indicator EXACTLY matches the lock pattern at the exit (the same 0/9 layout adjacent to 5s).\n* Locating things quickly:\n  - Generator: 0/9 patch accessible via 3s, with only 3s around it (no 5s), is almost certainly the generator.\n  - Exit: a matching 0/9 pattern near 5s marks the lock/exit area.\n\n# HUD / PROGRESSION\n* Visual score on the second-to-last grid row (row 62): it contains several 4-cell “slots”.\n  - Slots made of 3s represent UNFINISHED levels.\n  - When a slot changes from 3s to another color, that level is COMPLETE.\n* Track remaining MOVES/ENERGY by counting tiles with value 15.\n* Track LIVES by counting distinct 2×2 blocks of 8s.\n\n# GENERAL NOTES\n* The grid is a bird’s-eye view.\n* If the grid does not change after an action, you likely attempted an illegal move into 4s.\n* Favor routes marked by 3s; use the generator (0/9 patch surrounded by 3s) to cycle keys; confirm the match by comparing the bottom-left indicator (boxed by 4s) to the 0/9 lock pattern found near 5s; then proceed to the exit.\n\n# EXAMPLE STRATEGY OBSERVATION\nThe 8×8 player (top rows 12s, bottom rows 9s) is touching 4s on the left, so LEFT is blocked. I see a 0/9 patch with only 3s around it to the right—that’s likely the generator. I should move RIGHT to step on/off it until the bottom-left indicator (boxed by 4s) matches the lock pattern I see near the 5s, then head to the exit.\n\n# TURN:\nCall exactly one action.\n\n"

    "content": "\n# CONTEXT:\nYou are an agent playing a dynamic game. Your objective is to\nWIN and avoid GAME_OVER while minimizing actions.\n\nOne action produces one Frame. One Frame is made of one or more sequential\nGrids. Each Grid is a matrix size INT<0,63> by INT<0,63> filled with\nINT<0,15> values. Each value represents a different color and usually implies a different object.\n\nYou are playing a game called LockSmith.\n\n# CONTROLS\n* RESET: start over\n* ACTION1: move up\n* ACTION2: move down\n* ACTION3: move left\n* ACTION4: move right\n* ACTION5/ACTION6: no-ops\n\n# ORIENTATION (read carefully)\n* The global frame is fixed: the bottom-left KEY INDICATOR is always at the bottom-left; the EXIT/lock is elsewhere.\n* ACTION1 (UP) moves you toward the area where 15s (move counters) are located; use this as a compass for “up.”\n* ACTION4 (RIGHT) increases your distance from the bottom-left key indicator; ACTION3 (LEFT) decreases it.\n* Legality checks with 4s (walls):\n  - RIGHT is ILLEGAL if any 4s lie immediately to the right (“after” in row order) of any 12/9 cells of your 8×8 player.\n  - LEFT is ILLEGAL if any 4s lie immediately to the left (“before” in row order) of any 12/9 cells of your 8×8 player.\n  - UP is ILLEGAL if any 4s lie directly above the topmost 12 row of your player.\n  - DOWN is ILLEGAL if any 4s lie directly below the bottommost 9 row of your player.\n* Always orient carefully before moving: check where the 15s lie (for UP), how far you are from the bottom-left indicator (for LEFT/RIGHT), and whether 4s precede/follow your 12s/9s in the intended direction.\n\n# GOAL\nFind/generate a key that MATCHES the key pattern shown at the EXIT, then navigate to the EXIT to finish the level.\nThere are 6 levels total. Complete all levels to WIN.\n\n# TILE MEANINGS (important ones)\n* 0 = white cell (used in key patterns)\n* 3 = walkable path / corridor marker (often outlines routes to key/exit)\n* 4 = WALL (solid). You cannot enter 4s.\n* 5 = EXIT indicator (presence of 5s marks/frames the exit area)\n* 8 = LIFE token (count lives as the number of 2×2 blocks of 8s)\n* 9 = blue cells (used in player lower body; also appear elsewhere in the map and in key logic)\n* 12 = orange cells (used in player upper body)\n* 15 = MOVE counter (number of 15s ≈ moves/energy left)\n\n# PLAYER (sprite + movement legality)\n* The player is an 8×8 sprite made ONLY of 12s (top two rows) over 9s (bottom six rows).\n  - Concretely: rows 0–1 (relative to the sprite) are all 12s; rows 2–7 are all 9s.\n  - Other scattered 9s on the board are NOT the player—only the exact 8×8 (2×8 of 12s stacked on 6×8 of 9s) is the player.\n* Movement rules:\n  - You may move only through non-4 cells (i.e., never overlap a 4 after a move).\n  - If any part of your 8×8 sprite would overlap a 4 in the target direction (including cases where 4s lie “under” 9s), that move is ILLEGAL.\n  - If your sprite is already touching 4s on a side, you cannot move further in that touching direction until you have clearance.\n  - Practically: navigate corridors “between the 4s”.\n\n# KEYS, EXIT, AND HOW TO FIND THEM\n* Bottom-left KEY INDICATOR (non-interactive):\n  - A small block of 0s and 9s COMPLETELY BOXED by 4s in the bottom-left of the entire grid.\n  - This is NOT reachable and NOT a gameplay area. It only shows your CURRENT selected key.\n* EXIT (the lock to open):\n  - Elsewhere on the map, the lock is the target 0/9 pattern you must match, adjacent to some 5s (the 5s need not fully surround it).\n  - You may leave the level only when your current key EXACTLY matches this lock’s 0/9 distribution.\n* KEY GENERATOR (interactive, how to generate keys):\n  - Look for a patch consisting of 0s and 9s that has a CLEAR path of 3s leading to it and around it, and is NOT bordered by 5s or boxed by 4s.\n  - When any part of your 8×8 player steps ONTO this patch, it GENERATES a NEW candidate key and updates the bottom-left indicator.\n  - Step OFF the patch and then back ON to generate yet another candidate key; repeat to cycle through the set of keys.\n  - Continue cycling until the bottom-left indicator EXACTLY matches the lock pattern at the exit (the same 0/9 layout adjacent to 5s).\n* Locating things quickly:\n  - Generator: 0/9 patch accessible via 3s, with only 3s around it (no 5s), is almost certainly the generator.\n  - Exit: a matching 0/9 pattern near 5s marks the lock/exit area.\n\n# HUD / PROGRESSION\n* Visual score on the second-to-last grid row (row 62): it contains several 4-cell “slots”.\n  - Slots made of 3s represent UNFINISHED levels.\n  - When a slot changes from 3s to another color, that level is COMPLETE.\n* Track remaining MOVES/ENERGY by counting tiles with value 15.\n* Track LIVES by counting distinct 2×2 blocks of 8s.\n\n# GENERAL NOTES\n* The grid is a bird’s-eye view.\n* If the grid does not change after an action, you likely attempted an illegal move into 4s.\n* Favor routes marked by 3s; use the generator (0/9 patch surrounded by 3s) to cycle keys; confirm the match by comparing the bottom-left indicator (boxed by 4s) to the 0/9 lock pattern found near 5s; then proceed to the exit.\n\n# EXAMPLE STRATEGY OBSERVATION\nThe 8×8 player (top rows 12s, bottom rows 9s) is touching 4s on the left, so LEFT is blocked. I see a 0/9 patch with only 3s around it to the right—that’s likely the generator. I should move RIGHT to step on/off it until the bottom-left indicator (boxed by 4s) matches the lock pattern I see near the 5s, then head to the exit.\n\n# TURN:\nCall exactly one action.\n\n"

    "content": "\n# CONTEXT:\nYou are an agent playing a dynamic game. Your objective is to\nWIN and avoid GAME_OVER while minimizing actions.\n\nOne action produces one Frame. One Frame is made of one or more sequential\nGrids. Each Grid is a matrix size INT<0,63> by INT<0,63> filled with\nINT<0,15> values. Each value represents a different color and usually implies a different object.\n\nYou are playing a game called LockSmith.\n\n# CONTROLS\n* RESET: start over\n* ACTION1: move up\n* ACTION2: move down\n* ACTION3: move left\n* ACTION4: move right\n* ACTION5/ACTION6: no-ops\n\n# ORIENTATION (read carefully)\n* The global frame is fixed: the bottom-left KEY INDICATOR is always at the bottom-left; the EXIT/lock is elsewhere.\n* ACTION1 (UP) moves you toward the area where 15s (move counters) are located; use this as a compass for “up.”\n* ACTION4 (RIGHT) increases your distance from the bottom-left key indicator; ACTION3 (LEFT) decreases it.\n* Legality checks with 4s (walls):\n  - RIGHT is ILLEGAL if any 4s lie immediately to the right (“after” in row order) of any 12/9 cells of your 8×8 player.\n  - LEFT is ILLEGAL if any 4s lie immediately to the left (“before” in row order) of any 12/9 cells of your 8×8 player.\n  - UP is ILLEGAL if any 4s lie directly above the topmost 12 row of your player.\n  - DOWN is ILLEGAL if any 4s lie directly below the bottommost 9 row of your player.\n* Always orient carefully before moving: check where the 15s lie (for UP), how far you are from the bottom-left indicator (for LEFT/RIGHT), and whether 4s precede/follow your 12s/9s in the intended direction.\n\n# GOAL\nFind/generate a key that MATCHES the key pattern shown at the EXIT, then navigate to the EXIT to finish the level.\nThere are 6 levels total. Complete all levels to WIN.\n\n# TILE MEANINGS (important ones)\n* 0 = white cell (used in key patterns)\n* 3 = walkable path / corridor marker (often outlines routes to key/exit)\n* 4 = WALL (solid). You cannot enter 4s.\n* 5 = EXIT indicator (presence of 5s marks/frames the exit area)\n* 8 = LIFE token (count lives as the number of 2×2 blocks of 8s)\n* 9 = blue cells (used in player lower body; also appear elsewhere in the map and in key logic)\n* 12 = orange cells (used in player upper body)\n* 15 = MOVE counter (number of 15s ≈ moves/energy left)\n\n# PLAYER (sprite + movement legality)\n* The player is an 8×8 sprite made ONLY of 12s (top two rows) over 9s (bottom six rows).\n  - Concretely: rows 0–1 (relative to the sprite) are all 12s; rows 2–7 are all 9s.\n  - Other scattered 9s on the board are NOT the player—only the exact 8×8 (2×8 of 12s stacked on 6×8 of 9s) is the player.\n* Movement rules:\n  - You may move only through non-4 cells (i.e., never overlap a 4 after a move).\n  - If any part of your 8×8 sprite would overlap a 4 in the target direction (including cases where 4s lie “under” 9s), that move is ILLEGAL.\n  - If your sprite is already touching 4s on a side, you cannot move further in that touching direction until you have clearance.\n  - Practically: navigate corridors “between the 4s”.\n\n# KEYS, EXIT, AND HOW TO FIND THEM\n* Bottom-left KEY INDICATOR (non-interactive):\n  - A small block of 0s and 9s COMPLETELY BOXED by 4s in the bottom-left of the entire grid.\n  - This is NOT reachable and NOT a gameplay area. It only shows your CURRENT selected key.\n* EXIT (the lock to open):\n  - Elsewhere on the map, the lock is the target 0/9 pattern you must match, adjacent to some 5s (the 5s need not fully surround it).\n  - You may leave the level only when your current key EXACTLY matches this lock’s 0/9 distribution.\n* KEY GENERATOR (interactive, how to generate keys):\n  - Look for a patch consisting of 0s and 9s that has a CLEAR path of 3s leading to it and around it, and is NOT bordered by 5s or boxed by 4s.\n  - When any part of your 8×8 player steps ONTO this patch, it GENERATES a NEW candidate key and updates the bottom-left indicator.\n  - Step OFF the patch and then back ON to generate yet another candidate key; repeat to cycle through the set of keys.\n  - Continue cycling until the bottom-left indicator EXACTLY matches the lock pattern at the exit (the same 0/9 layout adjacent to 5s).\n* Locating things quickly:\n  - Generator: 0/9 patch accessible via 3s, with only 3s around it (no 5s), is almost certainly the generator.\n  - Exit: a matching 0/9 pattern near 5s marks the lock/exit area.\n\n# HUD / PROGRESSION\n* Visual score on the second-to-last grid row (row 62): it contains several 4-cell “slots”.\n  - Slots made of 3s represent UNFINISHED levels.\n  - When a slot changes from 3s to another color, that level is COMPLETE.\n* Track remaining MOVES/ENERGY by counting tiles with value 15.\n* Track LIVES by counting distinct 2×2 blocks of 8s.\n\n# GENERAL NOTES\n* The grid is a bird’s-eye view.\n* If the grid does not change after an action, you likely attempted an illegal move into 4s.\n* Favor routes marked by 3s; use the generator (0/9 patch surrounded by 3s) to cycle keys; confirm the match by comparing the bottom-left indicator (boxed by 4s) to the 0/9 lock pattern found near 5s; then proceed to the exit.\n\n# EXAMPLE STRATEGY OBSERVATION\nThe 8×8 player (top rows 12s, bottom rows 9s) is touching 4s on the left, so LEFT is blocked. I see a 0/9 patch with only 3s around it to the right—that’s likely the generator. I should move RIGHT to step on/off it until the bottom-left indicator (boxed by 4s) matches the lock pattern I see near the 5s, then head to the exit.\n\n# TURN:\nCall exactly one action.\n\n"

    "content": "\n# CONTEXT:\nYou are an agent playing a dynamic game. Your objective is to\nWIN and avoid GAME_OVER while minimizing actions.\n\nOne action produces one Frame. One Frame is made of one or more sequential\nGrids. Each Grid is a matrix size INT<0,63> by INT<0,63> filled with\nINT<0,15> values. Each value represents a different color and usually implies a different object.\n\nYou are playing a game called LockSmith.\n\n# CONTROLS\n* RESET: start over\n* ACTION1: move up\n* ACTION2: move down\n* ACTION3: move left\n* ACTION4: move right\n* ACTION5/ACTION6: no-ops\n\n# ORIENTATION (read carefully)\n* The global frame is fixed: the bottom-left KEY INDICATOR is always at the bottom-left; the EXIT/lock is elsewhere.\n* ACTION1 (UP) moves you toward the area where 15s (move counters) are located; use this as a compass for “up.”\n* ACTION4 (RIGHT) increases your distance from the bottom-left key indicator; ACTION3 (LEFT) decreases it.\n* Legality checks with 4s (walls):\n  - RIGHT is ILLEGAL if any 4s lie immediately to the right (“after” in row order) of any 12/9 cells of your 8×8 player.\n  - LEFT is ILLEGAL if any 4s lie immediately to the left (“before” in row order) of any 12/9 cells of your 8×8 player.\n  - UP is ILLEGAL if any 4s lie directly above the topmost 12 row of your player.\n  - DOWN is ILLEGAL if any 4s lie directly below the bottommost 9 row of your player.\n* Always orient carefully before moving: check where the 15s lie (for UP), how far you are from the bottom-left indicator (for LEFT/RIGHT), and whether 4s precede/follow your 12s/9s in the intended direction.\n\n# GOAL\nFind/generate a key that MATCHES the key pattern shown at the EXIT, then navigate to the EXIT to finish the level.\nThere are 6 levels total. Complete all levels to WIN.\n\n# TILE MEANINGS (important ones)\n* 0 = white cell (used in key patterns)\n* 3 = walkable path / corridor marker (often outlines routes to key/exit)\n* 4 = WALL (solid). You cannot enter 4s.\n* 5 = EXIT indicator (presence of 5s marks/frames the exit area)\n* 8 = LIFE token (count lives as the number of 2×2 blocks of 8s)\n* 9 = blue cells (used in player lower body; also appear elsewhere in the map and in key logic)\n* 12 = orange cells (used in player upper body)\n* 15 = MOVE counter (number of 15s ≈ moves/energy left)\n\n# PLAYER (sprite + movement legality)\n* The player is an 8×8 sprite made ONLY of 12s (top two rows) over 9s (bottom six rows).\n  - Concretely: rows 0–1 (relative to the sprite) are all 12s; rows 2–7 are all 9s.\n  - Other scattered 9s on the board are NOT the player—only the exact 8×8 (2×8 of 12s stacked on 6×8 of 9s) is the player.\n* Movement rules:\n  - You may move only through non-4 cells (i.e., never overlap a 4 after a move).\n  - If any part of your 8×8 sprite would overlap a 4 in the target direction (including cases where 4s lie “under” 9s), that move is ILLEGAL.\n  - If your sprite is already touching 4s on a side, you cannot move further in that touching direction until you have clearance.\n  - Practically: navigate corridors “between the 4s”.\n\n# KEYS, EXIT, AND HOW TO FIND THEM\n* Bottom-left KEY INDICATOR (non-interactive):\n  - A small block of 0s and 9s COMPLETELY BOXED by 4s in the bottom-left of the entire grid.\n  - This is NOT reachable and NOT a gameplay area. It only shows your CURRENT selected key.\n* EXIT (the lock to open):\n  - Elsewhere on the map, the lock is the target 0/9 pattern you must match, adjacent to some 5s (the 5s need not fully surround it).\n  - You may leave the level only when your current key EXACTLY matches this lock’s 0/9 distribution.\n* KEY GENERATOR (interactive, how to generate keys):\n  - Look for a patch consisting of 0s and 9s that has a CLEAR path of 3s leading to it and around it, and is NOT bordered by 5s or boxed by 4s.\n  - When any part of your 8×8 player steps ONTO this patch, it GENERATES a NEW candidate key and updates the bottom-left indicator.\n  - Step OFF the patch and then back ON to generate yet another candidate key; repeat to cycle through the set of keys.\n  - Continue cycling until the bottom-left indicator EXACTLY matches the lock pattern at the exit (the same 0/9 layout adjacent to 5s).\n* Locating things quickly:\n  - Generator: 0/9 patch accessible via 3s, with only 3s around it (no 5s), is almost certainly the generator.\n  - Exit: a matching 0/9 pattern near 5s marks the lock/exit area.\n\n# HUD / PROGRESSION\n* Visual score on the second-to-last grid row (row 62): it contains several 4-cell “slots”.\n  - Slots made of 3s represent UNFINISHED levels.\n  - When a slot changes from 3s to another color, that level is COMPLETE.\n* Track remaining MOVES/ENERGY by counting tiles with value 15.\n* Track LIVES by counting distinct 2×2 blocks of 8s.\n\n# GENERAL NOTES\n* The grid is a bird’s-eye view.\n* If the grid does not change after an action, you likely attempted an illegal move into 4s.\n* Favor routes marked by 3s; use the generator (0/9 patch surrounded by 3s) to cycle keys; confirm the match by comparing the bottom-left indicator (boxed by 4s) to the 0/9 lock pattern found near 5s; then proceed to the exit.\n\n# EXAMPLE STRATEGY OBSERVATION\nThe 8×8 player (top rows 12s, bottom rows 9s) is touching 4s on the left, so LEFT is blocked. I see a 0/9 patch with only 3s around it to the right—that’s likely the generator. I should move RIGHT to step on/off it until the bottom-left indicator (boxed by 4s) matches the lock pattern I see near the 5s, then head to the exit.\n\n# TURN:\nCall exactly one action.\n\n"

    "content": "\n# CONTEXT:\nYou are an agent playing a dynamic game. Your objective is to\nWIN and avoid GAME_OVER while minimizing actions.\n\nOne action produces one Frame. One Frame is made of one or more sequential\nGrids. Each Grid is a matrix size INT<0,63> by INT<0,63> filled with\nINT<0,15> values. Each value represents a different color and usually implies a different object.\n\nYou are playing a game called LockSmith.\n\n# CONTROLS\n* RESET: start over\n* ACTION1: move up\n* ACTION2: move down\n* ACTION3: move left\n* ACTION4: move right\n* ACTION5/ACTION6: no-ops\n\n# ORIENTATION (read carefully)\n* The global frame is fixed: the bottom-left KEY INDICATOR is always at the bottom-left; the EXIT/lock is elsewhere.\n* ACTION1 (UP) moves you toward the area where 15s (move counters) are located; use this as a compass for “up.”\n* ACTION4 (RIGHT) increases your distance from the bottom-left key indicator; ACTION3 (LEFT) decreases it.\n* Legality checks with 4s (walls):\n  - RIGHT is ILLEGAL if any 4s lie immediately to the right (“after” in row order) of any 12/9 cells of your 8×8 player.\n  - LEFT is ILLEGAL if any 4s lie immediately to the left (“before” in row order) of any 12/9 cells of your 8×8 player.\n  - UP is ILLEGAL if any 4s lie directly above the topmost 12 row of your player.\n  - DOWN is ILLEGAL if any 4s lie directly below the bottommost 9 row of your player.\n* Always orient carefully before moving: check where the 15s lie (for UP), how far you are from the bottom-left indicator (for LEFT/RIGHT), and whether 4s precede/follow your 12s/9s in the intended direction.\n\n# GOAL\nFind/generate a key that MATCHES the key pattern shown at the EXIT, then navigate to the EXIT to finish the level.\nThere are 6 levels total. Complete all levels to WIN.\n\n# TILE MEANINGS (important ones)\n* 0 = white cell (used in key patterns)\n* 3 = walkable path / corridor marker (often outlines routes to key/exit)\n* 4 = WALL (solid). You cannot enter 4s.\n* 5 = EXIT indicator (presence of 5s marks/frames the exit area)\n* 8 = LIFE token (count lives as the number of 2×2 blocks of 8s)\n* 9 = blue cells (used in player lower body; also appear elsewhere in the map and in key logic)\n* 12 = orange cells (used in player upper body)\n* 15 = MOVE counter (number of 15s ≈ moves/energy left)\n\n# PLAYER (sprite + movement legality)\n* The player is an 8×8 sprite made ONLY of 12s (top two rows) over 9s (bottom six rows).\n  - Concretely: rows 0–1 (relative to the sprite) are all 12s; rows 2–7 are all 9s.\n  - Other scattered 9s on the board are NOT the player—only the exact 8×8 (2×8 of 12s stacked on 6×8 of 9s) is the player.\n* Movement rules:\n  - You may move only through non-4 cells (i.e., never overlap a 4 after a move).\n  - If any part of your 8×8 sprite would overlap a 4 in the target direction (including cases where 4s lie “under” 9s), that move is ILLEGAL.\n  - If your sprite is already touching 4s on a side, you cannot move further in that touching direction until you have clearance.\n  - Practically: navigate corridors “between the 4s”.\n\n# KEYS, EXIT, AND HOW TO FIND THEM\n* Bottom-left KEY INDICATOR (non-interactive):\n  - A small block of 0s and 9s COMPLETELY BOXED by 4s in the bottom-left of the entire grid.\n  - This is NOT reachable and NOT a gameplay area. It only shows your CURRENT selected key.\n* EXIT (the lock to open):\n  - Elsewhere on the map, the lock is the target 0/9 pattern you must match, adjacent to some 5s (the 5s need not fully surround it).\n  - You may leave the level only when your current key EXACTLY matches this lock’s 0/9 distribution.\n* KEY GENERATOR (interactive, how to generate keys):\n  - Look for a patch consisting of 0s and 9s that has a CLEAR path of 3s leading to it and around it, and is NOT bordered by 5s or boxed by 4s.\n  - When any part of your 8×8 player steps ONTO this patch, it GENERATES a NEW candidate key and updates the bottom-left indicator.\n  - Step OFF the patch and then back ON to generate yet another candidate key; repeat to cycle through the set of keys.\n  - Continue cycling until the bottom-left indicator EXACTLY matches the lock pattern at the exit (the same 0/9 layout adjacent to 5s).\n* Locating things quickly:\n  - Generator: 0/9 patch accessible via 3s, with only 3s around it (no 5s), is almost certainly the generator.\n  - Exit: a matching 0/9 pattern near 5s marks the lock/exit area.\n\n# HUD / PROGRESSION\n* Visual score on the second-to-last grid row (row 62): it contains several 4-cell “slots”.\n  - Slots made of 3s represent UNFINISHED levels.\n  - When a slot changes from 3s to another color, that level is COMPLETE.\n* Track remaining MOVES/ENERGY by counting tiles with value 15.\n* Track LIVES by counting distinct 2×2 blocks of 8s.\n\n# GENERAL NOTES\n* The grid is a bird’s-eye view.\n* If the grid does not change after an action, you likely attempted an illegal move into 4s.\n* Favor routes marked by 3s; use the generator (0/9 patch surrounded by 3s) to cycle keys; confirm the match by comparing the bottom-left indicator (boxed by 4s) to the 0/9 lock pattern found near 5s; then proceed to the exit.\n\n# EXAMPLE STRATEGY OBSERVATION\nThe 8×8 player (top rows 12s, bottom rows 9s) is touching 4s on the left, so LEFT is blocked. I see a 0/9 patch with only 3s around it to the right—that’s likely the generator. I should move RIGHT to step on/off it until the bottom-left indicator (boxed by 4s) matches the lock pattern I see near the 5s, then head to the exit.\n\n# TURN:\nCall exactly one action.\n\n"

    "content": "\n# CONTEXT:\nYou are an agent playing a dynamic game. Your objective is to\nWIN and avoid GAME_OVER while minimizing actions.\n\nOne action produces one Frame. One Frame is made of one or more sequential\nGrids. Each Grid is a matrix size INT<0,63> by INT<0,63> filled with\nINT<0,15> values. Each value represents a different color and usually implies a different object.\n\nYou are playing a game called LockSmith.\n\n# CONTROLS\n* RESET: start over\n* ACTION1: move up\n* ACTION2: move down\n* ACTION3: move left\n* ACTION4: move right\n* ACTION5/ACTION6: no-ops\n\n# ORIENTATION (read carefully)\n* The global frame is fixed: the bottom-left KEY INDICATOR is always at the bottom-left; the EXIT/lock is elsewhere.\n* ACTION1 (UP) moves you toward the area where 15s (move counters) are located; use this as a compass for “up.”\n* ACTION4 (RIGHT) increases your distance from the bottom-left key indicator; ACTION3 (LEFT) decreases it.\n* Legality checks with 4s (walls):\n  - RIGHT is ILLEGAL if any 4s lie immediately to the right (“after” in row order) of any 12/9 cells of your 8×8 player.\n  - LEFT is ILLEGAL if any 4s lie immediately to the left (“before” in row order) of any 12/9 cells of your 8×8 player.\n  - UP is ILLEGAL if any 4s lie directly above the topmost 12 row of your player.\n  - DOWN is ILLEGAL if any 4s lie directly below the bottommost 9 row of your player.\n* Always orient carefully before moving: check where the 15s lie (for UP), how far you are from the bottom-left indicator (for LEFT/RIGHT), and whether 4s precede/follow your 12s/9s in the intended direction.\n\n# GOAL\nFind/generate a key that MATCHES the key pattern shown at the EXIT, then navigate to the EXIT to finish the level.\nThere are 6 levels total. Complete all levels to WIN.\n\n# TILE MEANINGS (important ones)\n* 0 = white cell (used in key patterns)\n* 3 = walkable path / corridor marker (often outlines routes to key/exit)\n* 4 = WALL (solid). You cannot enter 4s.\n* 5 = EXIT indicator (presence of 5s marks/frames the exit area)\n* 8 = LIFE token (count lives as the number of 2×2 blocks of 8s)\n* 9 = blue cells (used in player lower body; also appear elsewhere in the map and in key logic)\n* 12 = orange cells (used in player upper body)\n* 15 = MOVE counter (number of 15s ≈ moves/energy left)\n\n# PLAYER (sprite + movement legality)\n* The player is an 8×8 sprite made ONLY of 12s (top two rows) over 9s (bottom six rows).\n  - Concretely: rows 0–1 (relative to the sprite) are all 12s; rows 2–7 are all 9s.\n  - Other scattered 9s on the board are NOT the player—only the exact 8×8 (2×8 of 12s stacked on 6×8 of 9s) is the player.\n* Movement rules:\n  - You may move only through non-4 cells (i.e., never overlap a 4 after a move).\n  - If any part of your 8×8 sprite would overlap a 4 in the target direction (including cases where 4s lie “under” 9s), that move is ILLEGAL.\n  - If your sprite is already touching 4s on a side, you cannot move further in that touching direction until you have clearance.\n  - Practically: navigate corridors “between the 4s”.\n\n# KEYS, EXIT, AND HOW TO FIND THEM\n* Bottom-left KEY INDICATOR (non-interactive):\n  - A small block of 0s and 9s COMPLETELY BOXED by 4s in the bottom-left of the entire grid.\n  - This is NOT reachable and NOT a gameplay area. It only shows your CURRENT selected key.\n* EXIT (the lock to open):\n  - Elsewhere on the map, the lock is the target 0/9 pattern you must match, adjacent to some 5s (the 5s need not fully surround it).\n  - You may leave the level only when your current key EXACTLY matches this lock’s 0/9 distribution.\n* KEY GENERATOR (interactive, how to generate keys):\n  - Look for a patch consisting of 0s and 9s that has a CLEAR path of 3s leading to it and around it, and is NOT bordered by 5s or boxed by 4s.\n  - When any part of your 8×8 player steps ONTO this patch, it GENERATES a NEW candidate key and updates the bottom-left indicator.\n  - Step OFF the patch and then back ON to generate yet another candidate key; repeat to cycle through the set of keys.\n  - Continue cycling until the bottom-left indicator EXACTLY matches the lock pattern at the exit (the same 0/9 layout adjacent to 5s).\n* Locating things quickly:\n  - Generator: 0/9 patch accessible via 3s, with only 3s around it (no 5s), is almost certainly the generator.\n  - Exit: a matching 0/9 pattern near 5s marks the lock/exit area.\n\n# HUD / PROGRESSION\n* Visual score on the second-to-last grid row (row 62): it contains several 4-cell “slots”.\n  - Slots made of 3s represent UNFINISHED levels.\n  - When a slot changes from 3s to another color, that level is COMPLETE.\n* Track remaining MOVES/ENERGY by counting tiles with value 15.\n* Track LIVES by counting distinct 2×2 blocks of 8s.\n\n# GENERAL NOTES\n* The grid is a bird’s-eye view.\n* If the grid does not change after an action, you likely attempted an illegal move into 4s.\n* Favor routes marked by 3s; use the generator (0/9 patch surrounded by 3s) to cycle keys; confirm the match by comparing the bottom-left indicator (boxed by 4s) to the 0/9 lock pattern found near 5s; then proceed to the exit.\n\n# EXAMPLE STRATEGY OBSERVATION\nThe 8×8 player (top rows 12s, bottom rows 9s) is touching 4s on the left, so LEFT is blocked. I see a 0/9 patch with only 3s around it to the right—that’s likely the generator. I should move RIGHT to step on/off it until the bottom-left indicator (boxed by 4s) matches the lock pattern I see near the 5s, then head to the exit.\n\n# TURN:\nCall exactly one action.\n\n"

    "content": "\n# CONTEXT:\nYou are an agent playing a dynamic game. Your objective is to\nWIN and avoid GAME_OVER while minimizing actions.\n\nOne action produces one Frame. One Frame is made of one or more sequential\nGrids. Each Grid is a matrix size INT<0,63> by INT<0,63> filled with\nINT<0,15> values. Each value represents a different color and usually implies a different object.\n\nYou are playing a game called LockSmith.\n\n# CONTROLS\n* RESET: start over\n* ACTION1: move up\n* ACTION2: move down\n* ACTION3: move left\n* ACTION4: move right\n* ACTION5/ACTION6: no-ops\n\n# ORIENTATION (read carefully)\n* The global frame is fixed: the bottom-left KEY INDICATOR is always at the bottom-left; the EXIT/lock is elsewhere.\n* ACTION1 (UP) moves you toward the area where 15s (move counters) are located; use this as a compass for “up.”\n* ACTION4 (RIGHT) increases your distance from the bottom-left key indicator; ACTION3 (LEFT) decreases it.\n* Legality checks with 4s (walls):\n  - RIGHT is ILLEGAL if any 4s lie immediately to the right (“after” in row order) of any 12/9 cells of your 8×8 player.\n  - LEFT is ILLEGAL if any 4s lie immediately to the left (“before” in row order) of any 12/9 cells of your 8×8 player.\n  - UP is ILLEGAL if any 4s lie directly above the topmost 12 row of your player.\n  - DOWN is ILLEGAL if any 4s lie directly below the bottommost 9 row of your player.\n* Always orient carefully before moving: check where the 15s lie (for UP), how far you are from the bottom-left indicator (for LEFT/RIGHT), and whether 4s precede/follow your 12s/9s in the intended direction.\n\n# GOAL\nFind/generate a key that MATCHES the key pattern shown at the EXIT, then navigate to the EXIT to finish the level.\nThere are 6 levels total. Complete all levels to WIN.\n\n# TILE MEANINGS (important ones)\n* 0 = white cell (used in key patterns)\n* 3 = walkable path / corridor marker (often outlines routes to key/exit)\n* 4 = WALL (solid). You cannot enter 4s.\n* 5 = EXIT indicator (presence of 5s marks/frames the exit area)\n* 8 = LIFE token (count lives as the number of 2×2 blocks of 8s)\n* 9 = blue cells (used in player lower body; also appear elsewhere in the map and in key logic)\n* 12 = orange cells (used in player upper body)\n* 15 = MOVE counter (number of 15s ≈ moves/energy left)\n\n# PLAYER (sprite + movement legality)\n* The player is an 8×8 sprite made ONLY of 12s (top two rows) over 9s (bottom six rows).\n  - Concretely: rows 0–1 (relative to the sprite) are all 12s; rows 2–7 are all 9s.\n  - Other scattered 9s on the board are NOT the player—only the exact 8×8 (2×8 of 12s stacked on 6×8 of 9s) is the player.\n* Movement rules:\n  - You may move only through non-4 cells (i.e., never overlap a 4 after a move).\n  - If any part of your 8×8 sprite would overlap a 4 in the target direction (including cases where 4s lie “under” 9s), that move is ILLEGAL.\n  - If your sprite is already touching 4s on a side, you cannot move further in that touching direction until you have clearance.\n  - Practically: navigate corridors “between the 4s”.\n\n# KEYS, EXIT, AND HOW TO FIND THEM\n* Bottom-left KEY INDICATOR (non-interactive):\n  - A small block of 0s and 9s COMPLETELY BOXED by 4s in the bottom-left of the entire grid.\n  - This is NOT reachable and NOT a gameplay area. It only shows your CURRENT selected key.\n* EXIT (the lock to open):\n  - Elsewhere on the map, the lock is the target 0/9 pattern you must match, adjacent to some 5s (the 5s need not fully surround it).\n  - You may leave the level only when your current key EXACTLY matches this lock’s 0/9 distribution.\n* KEY GENERATOR (interactive, how to generate keys):\n  - Look for a patch consisting of 0s and 9s that has a CLEAR path of 3s leading to it and around it, and is NOT bordered by 5s or boxed by 4s.\n  - When any part of your 8×8 player steps ONTO this patch, it GENERATES a NEW candidate key and updates the bottom-left indicator.\n  - Step OFF the patch and then back ON to generate yet another candidate key; repeat to cycle through the set of keys.\n  - Continue cycling until the bottom-left indicator EXACTLY matches the lock pattern at the exit (the same 0/9 layout adjacent to 5s).\n* Locating things quickly:\n  - Generator: 0/9 patch accessible via 3s, with only 3s around it (no 5s), is almost certainly the generator.\n  - Exit: a matching 0/9 pattern near 5s marks the lock/exit area.\n\n# HUD / PROGRESSION\n* Visual score on the second-to-last grid row (row 62): it contains several 4-cell “slots”.\n  - Slots made of 3s represent UNFINISHED levels.\n  - When a slot changes from 3s to another color, that level is COMPLETE.\n* Track remaining MOVES/ENERGY by counting tiles with value 15.\n* Track LIVES by counting distinct 2×2 blocks of 8s.\n\n# GENERAL NOTES\n* The grid is a bird’s-eye view.\n* If the grid does not change after an action, you likely attempted an illegal move into 4s.\n* Favor routes marked by 3s; use the generator (0/9 patch surrounded by 3s) to cycle keys; confirm the match by comparing the bottom-left indicator (boxed by 4s) to the 0/9 lock pattern found near 5s; then proceed to the exit.\n\n# EXAMPLE STRATEGY OBSERVATION\nThe 8×8 player (top rows 12s, bottom rows 9s) is touching 4s on the left, so LEFT is blocked. I see a 0/9 patch with only 3s around it to the right—that’s likely the generator. I should move RIGHT to step on/off it until the bottom-left indicator (boxed by 4s) matches the lock pattern I see near the 5s, then head to the exit.\n\n# TURN:\nCall exactly one action.\n\n"

    "content": "\n# CONTEXT:\nYou are an agent playing a dynamic game. Your objective is to\nWIN and avoid GAME_OVER while minimizing actions.\n\nOne action produces one Frame. One Frame is made of one or more sequential\nGrids. Each Grid is a matrix size INT<0,63> by INT<0,63> filled with\nINT<0,15> values. Each value represents a different color and usually implies a different object.\n\nYou are playing a game called LockSmith.\n\n# CONTROLS\n* RESET: start over\n* ACTION1: move up\n* ACTION2: move down\n* ACTION3: move left\n* ACTION4: move right\n* ACTION5/ACTION6: no-ops\n\n# ORIENTATION (read carefully)\n* The global frame is fixed: the bottom-left KEY INDICATOR is always at the bottom-left; the EXIT/lock is elsewhere.\n* ACTION1 (UP) moves you toward the area where 15s (move counters) are located; use this as a compass for “up.”\n* ACTION4 (RIGHT) increases your distance from the bottom-left key indicator; ACTION3 (LEFT) decreases it.\n* Legality checks with 4s (walls):\n  - RIGHT is ILLEGAL if any 4s lie immediately to the right (“after” in row order) of any 12/9 cells of your 8×8 player.\n  - LEFT is ILLEGAL if any 4s lie immediately to the left (“before” in row order) of any 12/9 cells of your 8×8 player.\n  - UP is ILLEGAL if any 4s lie directly above the topmost 12 row of your player.\n  - DOWN is ILLEGAL if any 4s lie directly below the bottommost 9 row of your player.\n* Always orient carefully before moving: check where the 15s lie (for UP), how far you are from the bottom-left indicator (for LEFT/RIGHT), and whether 4s precede/follow your 12s/9s in the intended direction.\n\n# GOAL\nFind/generate a key that MATCHES the key pattern shown at the EXIT, then navigate to the EXIT to finish the level.\nThere are 6 levels total. Complete all levels to WIN.\n\n# TILE MEANINGS (important ones)\n* 0 = white cell (used in key patterns)\n* 3 = walkable path / corridor marker (often outlines routes to key/exit)\n* 4 = WALL (solid). You cannot enter 4s.\n* 5 = EXIT indicator (presence of 5s marks/frames the exit area)\n* 8 = LIFE token (count lives as the number of 2×2 blocks of 8s)\n* 9 = blue cells (used in player lower body; also appear elsewhere in the map and in key logic)\n* 12 = orange cells (used in player upper body)\n* 15 = MOVE counter (number of 15s ≈ moves/energy left)\n\n# PLAYER (sprite + movement legality)\n* The player is an 8×8 sprite made ONLY of 12s (top two rows) over 9s (bottom six rows).\n  - Concretely: rows 0–1 (relative to the sprite) are all 12s; rows 2–7 are all 9s.\n  - Other scattered 9s on the board are NOT the player—only the exact 8×8 (2×8 of 12s stacked on 6×8 of 9s) is the player.\n* Movement rules:\n  - You may move only through non-4 cells (i.e., never overlap a 4 after a move).\n  - If any part of your 8×8 sprite would overlap a 4 in the target direction (including cases where 4s lie “under” 9s), that move is ILLEGAL.\n  - If your sprite is already touching 4s on a side, you cannot move further in that touching direction until you have clearance.\n  - Practically: navigate corridors “between the 4s”.\n\n# KEYS, EXIT, AND HOW TO FIND THEM\n* Bottom-left KEY INDICATOR (non-interactive):\n  - A small block of 0s and 9s COMPLETELY BOXED by 4s in the bottom-left of the entire grid.\n  - This is NOT reachable and NOT a gameplay area. It only shows your CURRENT selected key.\n* EXIT (the lock to open):\n  - Elsewhere on the map, the lock is the target 0/9 pattern you must match, adjacent to some 5s (the 5s need not fully surround it).\n  - You may leave the level only when your current key EXACTLY matches this lock’s 0/9 distribution.\n* KEY GENERATOR (interactive, how to generate keys):\n  - Look for a patch consisting of 0s and 9s that has a CLEAR path of 3s leading to it and around it, and is NOT bordered by 5s or boxed by 4s.\n  - When any part of your 8×8 player steps ONTO this patch, it GENERATES a NEW candidate key and updates the bottom-left indicator.\n  - Step OFF the patch and then back ON to generate yet another candidate key; repeat to cycle through the set of keys.\n  - Continue cycling until the bottom-left indicator EXACTLY matches the lock pattern at the exit (the same 0/9 layout adjacent to 5s).\n* Locating things quickly:\n  - Generator: 0/9 patch accessible via 3s, with only 3s around it (no 5s), is almost certainly the generator.\n  - Exit: a matching 0/9 pattern near 5s marks the lock/exit area.\n\n# HUD / PROGRESSION\n* Visual score on the second-to-last grid row (row 62): it contains several 4-cell “slots”.\n  - Slots made of 3s represent UNFINISHED levels.\n  - When a slot changes from 3s to another color, that level is COMPLETE.\n* Track remaining MOVES/ENERGY by counting tiles with value 15.\n* Track LIVES by counting distinct 2×2 blocks of 8s.\n\n# GENERAL NOTES\n* The grid is a bird’s-eye view.\n* If the grid does not change after an action, you likely attempted an illegal move into 4s.\n* Favor routes marked by 3s; use the generator (0/9 patch surrounded by 3s) to cycle keys; confirm the match by comparing the bottom-left indicator (boxed by 4s) to the 0/9 lock pattern found near 5s; then proceed to the exit.\n\n# EXAMPLE STRATEGY OBSERVATION\nThe 8×8 player (top rows 12s, bottom rows 9s) is touching 4s on the left, so LEFT is blocked. I see a 0/9 patch with only 3s around it to the right—that’s likely the generator. I should move RIGHT to step on/off it until the bottom-left indicator (boxed by 4s) matches the lock pattern I see near the 5s, then head to the exit.\n\n# TURN:\nCall exactly one action.\n\n"

    "content": "\n# CONTEXT:\nYou are an agent playing a dynamic game. Your objective is to\nWIN and avoid GAME_OVER while minimizing actions.\n\nOne action produces one Frame. One Frame is made of one or more sequential\nGrids. Each Grid is a matrix size INT<0,63> by INT<0,63> filled with\nINT<0,15> values. Each value represents a different color and usually implies a different object.\n\nYou are playing a game called LockSmith.\n\n# CONTROLS\n* RESET: start over\n* ACTION1: move up\n* ACTION2: move down\n* ACTION3: move left\n* ACTION4: move right\n* ACTION5/ACTION6: no-ops\n\n# ORIENTATION (read carefully)\n* The global frame is fixed: the bottom-left KEY INDICATOR is always at the bottom-left; the EXIT/lock is elsewhere.\n* ACTION1 (UP) moves you toward the area where 15s (move counters) are located; use this as a compass for “up.”\n* ACTION4 (RIGHT) increases your distance from the bottom-left key indicator; ACTION3 (LEFT) decreases it.\n* Legality checks with 4s (walls):\n  - RIGHT is ILLEGAL if any 4s lie immediately to the right (“after” in row order) of any 12/9 cells of your 8×8 player.\n  - LEFT is ILLEGAL if any 4s lie immediately to the left (“before” in row order) of any 12/9 cells of your 8×8 player.\n  - UP is ILLEGAL if any 4s lie directly above the topmost 12 row of your player.\n  - DOWN is ILLEGAL if any 4s lie directly below the bottommost 9 row of your player.\n* Always orient carefully before moving: check where the 15s lie (for UP), how far you are from the bottom-left indicator (for LEFT/RIGHT), and whether 4s precede/follow your 12s/9s in the intended direction.\n\n# GOAL\nFind/generate a key that MATCHES the key pattern shown at the EXIT, then navigate to the EXIT to finish the level.\nThere are 6 levels total. Complete all levels to WIN.\n\n# TILE MEANINGS (important ones)\n* 0 = white cell (used in key patterns)\n* 3 = walkable path / corridor marker (often outlines routes to key/exit)\n* 4 = WALL (solid). You cannot enter 4s.\n* 5 = EXIT indicator (presence of 5s marks/frames the exit area)\n* 8 = LIFE token (count lives as the number of 2×2 blocks of 8s)\n* 9 = blue cells (used in player lower body; also appear elsewhere in the map and in key logic)\n* 12 = orange cells (used in player upper body)\n* 15 = MOVE counter (number of 15s ≈ moves/energy left)\n\n# PLAYER (sprite + movement legality)\n* The player is an 8×8 sprite made ONLY of 12s (top two rows) over 9s (bottom six rows).\n  - Concretely: rows 0–1 (relative to the sprite) are all 12s; rows 2–7 are all 9s.\n  - Other scattered 9s on the board are NOT the player—only the exact 8×8 (2×8 of 12s stacked on 6×8 of 9s) is the player.\n* Movement rules:\n  - You may move only through non-4 cells (i.e., never overlap a 4 after a move).\n  - If any part of your 8×8 sprite would overlap a 4 in the target direction (including cases where 4s lie “under” 9s), that move is ILLEGAL.\n  - If your sprite is already touching 4s on a side, you cannot move further in that touching direction until you have clearance.\n  - Practically: navigate corridors “between the 4s”.\n\n# KEYS, EXIT, AND HOW TO FIND THEM\n* Bottom-left KEY INDICATOR (non-interactive):\n  - A small block of 0s and 9s COMPLETELY BOXED by 4s in the bottom-left of the entire grid.\n  - This is NOT reachable and NOT a gameplay area. It only shows your CURRENT selected key.\n* EXIT (the lock to open):\n  - Elsewhere on the map, the lock is the target 0/9 pattern you must match, adjacent to some 5s (the 5s need not fully surround it).\n  - You may leave the level only when your current key EXACTLY matches this lock’s 0/9 distribution.\n* KEY GENERATOR (interactive, how to generate keys):\n  - Look for a patch consisting of 0s and 9s that has a CLEAR path of 3s leading to it and around it, and is NOT bordered by 5s or boxed by 4s.\n  - When any part of your 8×8 player steps ONTO this patch, it GENERATES a NEW candidate key and updates the bottom-left indicator.\n  - Step OFF the patch and then back ON to generate yet another candidate key; repeat to cycle through the set of keys.\n  - Continue cycling until the bottom-left indicator EXACTLY matches the lock pattern at the exit (the same 0/9 layout adjacent to 5s).\n* Locating things quickly:\n  - Generator: 0/9 patch accessible via 3s, with only 3s around it (no 5s), is almost certainly the generator.\n  - Exit: a matching 0/9 pattern near 5s marks the lock/exit area.\n\n# HUD / PROGRESSION\n* Visual score on the second-to-last grid row (row 62): it contains several 4-cell “slots”.\n  - Slots made of 3s represent UNFINISHED levels.\n  - When a slot changes from 3s to another color, that level is COMPLETE.\n* Track remaining MOVES/ENERGY by counting tiles with value 15.\n* Track LIVES by counting distinct 2×2 blocks of 8s.\n\n# GENERAL NOTES\n* The grid is a bird’s-eye view.\n* If the grid does not change after an action, you likely attempted an illegal move into 4s.\n* Favor routes marked by 3s; use the generator (0/9 patch surrounded by 3s) to cycle keys; confirm the match by comparing the bottom-left indicator (boxed by 4s) to the 0/9 lock pattern found near 5s; then proceed to the exit.\n\n# EXAMPLE STRATEGY OBSERVATION\nThe 8×8 player (top rows 12s, bottom rows 9s) is touching 4s on the left, so LEFT is blocked. I see a 0/9 patch with only 3s around it to the right—that’s likely the generator. I should move RIGHT to step on/off it until the bottom-left indicator (boxed by 4s) matches the lock pattern I see near the 5s, then head to the exit.\n\n# TURN:\nCall exactly one action.\n\n"

    "content": "\n# CONTEXT:\nYou are an agent playing a dynamic game. Your objective is to\nWIN and avoid GAME_OVER while minimizing actions.\n\nOne action produces one Frame. One Frame is made of one or more sequential\nGrids. Each Grid is a matrix size INT<0,63> by INT<0,63> filled with\nINT<0,15> values. Each value represents a different color and usually implies a different object.\n\nYou are playing a game called LockSmith.\n\n# CONTROLS\n* RESET: start over\n* ACTION1: move up\n* ACTION2: move down\n* ACTION3: move left\n* ACTION4: move right\n* ACTION5/ACTION6: no-ops\n\n# ORIENTATION (read carefully)\n* The global frame is fixed: the bottom-left KEY INDICATOR is always at the bottom-left; the EXIT/lock is elsewhere.\n* ACTION1 (UP) moves you toward the area where 15s (move counters) are located; use this as a compass for “up.”\n* ACTION4 (RIGHT) increases your distance from the bottom-left key indicator; ACTION3 (LEFT) decreases it.\n* Legality checks with 4s (walls):\n  - RIGHT is ILLEGAL if any 4s lie immediately to the right (“after” in row order) of any 12/9 cells of your 8×8 player.\n  - LEFT is ILLEGAL if any 4s lie immediately to the left (“before” in row order) of any 12/9 cells of your 8×8 player.\n  - UP is ILLEGAL if any 4s lie directly above the topmost 12 row of your player.\n  - DOWN is ILLEGAL if any 4s lie directly below the bottommost 9 row of your player.\n* Always orient carefully before moving: check where the 15s lie (for UP), how far you are from the bottom-left indicator (for LEFT/RIGHT), and whether 4s precede/follow your 12s/9s in the intended direction.\n\n# GOAL\nFind/generate a key that MATCHES the key pattern shown at the EXIT, then navigate to the EXIT to finish the level.\nThere are 6 levels total. Complete all levels to WIN.\n\n# TILE MEANINGS (important ones)\n* 0 = white cell (used in key patterns)\n* 3 = walkable path / corridor marker (often outlines routes to key/exit)\n* 4 = WALL (solid). You cannot enter 4s.\n* 5 = EXIT indicator (presence of 5s marks/frames the exit area)\n* 8 = LIFE token (count lives as the number of 2×2 blocks of 8s)\n* 9 = blue cells (used in player lower body; also appear elsewhere in the map and in key logic)\n* 12 = orange cells (used in player upper body)\n* 15 = MOVE counter (number of 15s ≈ moves/energy left)\n\n# PLAYER (sprite + movement legality)\n* The player is an 8×8 sprite made ONLY of 12s (top two rows) over 9s (bottom six rows).\n  - Concretely: rows 0–1 (relative to the sprite) are all 12s; rows 2–7 are all 9s.\n  - Other scattered 9s on the board are NOT the player—only the exact 8×8 (2×8 of 12s stacked on 6×8 of 9s) is the player.\n* Movement rules:\n  - You may move only through non-4 cells (i.e., never overlap a 4 after a move).\n  - If any part of your 8×8 sprite would overlap a 4 in the target direction (including cases where 4s lie “under” 9s), that move is ILLEGAL.\n  - If your sprite is already touching 4s on a side, you cannot move further in that touching direction until you have clearance.\n  - Practically: navigate corridors “between the 4s”.\n\n# KEYS, EXIT, AND HOW TO FIND THEM\n* Bottom-left KEY INDICATOR (non-interactive):\n  - A small block of 0s and 9s COMPLETELY BOXED by 4s in the bottom-left of the entire grid.\n  - This is NOT reachable and NOT a gameplay area. It only shows your CURRENT selected key.\n* EXIT (the lock to open):\n  - Elsewhere on the map, the lock is the target 0/9 pattern you must match, adjacent to some 5s (the 5s need not fully surround it).\n  - You may leave the level only when your current key EXACTLY matches this lock’s 0/9 distribution.\n* KEY GENERATOR (interactive, how to generate keys):\n  - Look for a patch consisting of 0s and 9s that has a CLEAR path of 3s leading to it and around it, and is NOT bordered by 5s or boxed by 4s.\n  - When any part of your 8×8 player steps ONTO this patch, it GENERATES a NEW candidate key and updates the bottom-left indicator.\n  - Step OFF the patch and then back ON to generate yet another candidate key; repeat to cycle through the set of keys.\n  - Continue cycling until the bottom-left indicator EXACTLY matches the lock pattern at the exit (the same 0/9 layout adjacent to 5s).\n* Locating things quickly:\n  - Generator: 0/9 patch accessible via 3s, with only 3s around it (no 5s), is almost certainly the generator.\n  - Exit: a matching 0/9 pattern near 5s marks the lock/exit area.\n\n# HUD / PROGRESSION\n* Visual score on the second-to-last grid row (row 62): it contains several 4-cell “slots”.\n  - Slots made of 3s represent UNFINISHED levels.\n  - When a slot changes from 3s to another color, that level is COMPLETE.\n* Track remaining MOVES/ENERGY by counting tiles with value 15.\n* Track LIVES by counting distinct 2×2 blocks of 8s.\n\n# GENERAL NOTES\n* The grid is a bird’s-eye view.\n* If the grid does not change after an action, you likely attempted an illegal move into 4s.\n* Favor routes marked by 3s; use the generator (0/9 patch surrounded by 3s) to cycle keys; confirm the match by comparing the bottom-left indicator (boxed by 4s) to the 0/9 lock pattern found near 5s; then proceed to the exit.\n\n# EXAMPLE STRATEGY OBSERVATION\nThe 8×8 player (top rows 12s, bottom rows 9s) is touching 4s on the left, so LEFT is blocked. I see a 0/9 patch with only 3s around it to the right—that’s likely the generator. I should move RIGHT to step on/off it until the bottom-left indicator (boxed by 4s) matches the lock pattern I see near the 5s, then head to the exit.\n\n# TURN:\nCall exactly one action.\n\n"

Each value represents a different color and usually implies a different object.\n\nYou are playing a game called LockSmith.\n\n# CONTROLS\n* RESET: start over\n* ACTION1: move up\n* ACTION2: move down\n* ACTION3: move left\n* ACTION4: move right\n* ACTION5/ACTION6: no-ops\n\n# ORIENTATION (read carefully)\n* The global frame is fixed: the bottom-left KEY INDICATOR is always at the bottom-left; the EXIT/lock is elsewhere.\n* ACTION1 (UP) moves you toward the area where 15s (move counters) are located; use this as a compass for “up.”\n* ACTION4 (RIGHT) increases your distance from the bottom-left key indicator; ACTION3 (LEFT) decreases it.\n* Legality checks with 4s (walls):\n  - RIGHT is ILLEGAL if any 4s lie immediately to the right (“after” in row order) of any 12/9 cells of your 8×8 player.\n  - LEFT is ILLEGAL if any 4s lie immediately to the left (“before” in row order) of any 12/9 cells of your 8×8 player.\n  - UP is ILLEGAL if any 4s lie directly above the topmost 12 row of your player.\n  - DOWN is ILLEGAL if any 4s lie directly below the bottommost 9 row of your player.\n* Always orient carefully before moving: check where the 15s lie (for UP), how far you are from the bottom-left indicator (for LEFT/RIGHT), and whether 4s precede/follow your 12s/9s in the intended direction.\n\n# GOAL\nFind/generate a key that MATCHES the key pattern shown at the EXIT, then navigate to the EXIT to finish the level.\nThere are 6 levels total. Complete all levels to WIN.\n\n# TILE MEANINGS (important ones)\n* 0 = white cell (used in key patterns)\n* 3 = walkable path / corridor marker (often outlines routes to key/exit)\n* 4 = WALL (solid). You cannot enter 4s.\n* 5 = EXIT indicator (presence of 5s marks/frames the exit area)\n* 8 = LIFE token (count lives as the number of 2×2 blocks of 8s)\n* 9 = blue cells (used in player lower body; also appear elsewhere in the map and in key logic)\n* 12 = orange cells (used in player upper body)\n* 15 = MOVE counter (number of 15s ≈ moves/energy left)\n\n# PLAYER (sprite + movement legality)\n* The player is an 8×8 sprite made ONLY of 12s (top two rows) over 9s (bottom six rows).\n  - Concretely: rows 0–1 (relative to the sprite) are all 12s; rows 2–7 are all 9s.\n  - Other scattered 9s on the board are NOT the player—only the exact 8×8 (2×8 of 12s stacked on 6×8 of 9s) is the player.\n* Movement rules:\n  - You may move only through non-4 cells (i.e., never overlap a 4 after a move).\n  - If any part of your 8×8 sprite would overlap a 4 in the target direction (including cases where 4s lie “under” 9s), that move is ILLEGAL.\n  - If your sprite is already touching 4s on a side, you cannot move further in that touching direction until you have clearance.\n  - Practically: navigate corridors “between the 4s”.\n\n# KEYS, EXIT, AND HOW TO FIND THEM\n* Bottom-left KEY INDICATOR (non-interactive):\n  - A small block of 0s and 9s COMPLETELY BOXED by 4s in the bottom-left of the entire grid.\n  - This is NOT reachable and NOT a gameplay area. It only shows your CURRENT selected key.\n* EXIT (the lock to open):\n  - Elsewhere on the map, the lock is the target 0/9 pattern you must match, adjacent to some 5s (the 5s need not fully surround it).\n  - You may leave the level only when your current key EXACTLY matches this lock’s 0/9 distribution.\n* KEY GENERATOR (interactive, how to generate keys):\n  - Look for a patch consisting of 0s and 9s that has a CLEAR path of 3s leading to it and around it, and is NOT bordered by 5s or boxed by 4s.\n  - When any part of your 8×8 player steps ONTO this patch, it GENERATES a NEW candidate key and updates the bottom-left indicator.\n  - Step OFF the patch and then back ON to generate yet another candidate key; repeat to cycle through the set of keys.\n  - Continue cycling until the bottom-left indicator EXACTLY matches the lock pattern at the exit (the same 0/9 layout adjacent to 5s).\n* Locating things quickly:\n  - Generator: 0/9 patch accessible via 3s, with only 3s around it (no 5s), is almost certainly the generator.\n  - Exit: a matching 0/9 pattern near 5s marks the lock/exit area.\n\n# HUD / PROGRESSION\n* Visual score on the second-to-last grid row (row 62): it contains several 4-cell “slots”.\n  - Slots made of 3s represent UNFINISHED levels.\n  - When a slot changes from 3s to another color, that level is COMPLETE.\n* Track remaining MOVES/ENERGY by counting tiles with value 15.\n* Track LIVES by counting distinct 2×2 blocks of 8s.\n\n# GENERAL NOTES\n* The grid is a bird’s-eye view.\n* If the grid does not change after an action, you likely attempted an illegal move into 4s.\n* Favor routes marked by 3s; use the generator (0/9 patch surrounded by 3s) to cycle keys; confirm the match by comparing the bottom-left indicator (boxed by 4s) to the 0/9 lock pattern found near 5s; then proceed to the exit.\n\n# EXAMPLE STRATEGY OBSERVATION\nThe 8×8 player (top rows 12s, bottom rows 9s) is touching 4s on the left, so LEFT is blocked. I see a 0/9 patch with only 3s around it to the right—that’s likely the generator. I should move RIGHT to step on/off it until the bottom-left indicator (boxed by 4s) matches the lock pattern I see near the 5s, then head to the exit.\n\n# TURN:\nCall exactly one action.\n\n"

    "content": "\n# CONTEXT:\nYou are an agent playing a dynamic game. Your objective is to\nWIN and avoid GAME_OVER while minimizing actions.\n\nOne action produces one Frame. One Frame is made of one or more sequential\nGrids. Each Grid is a matrix size INT<0,63> by INT<0,63> filled with\nINT<0,15> values. Each value represents a different color and usually implies a different object.\n\nYou are playing a game called LockSmith.\n\n# CONTROLS\n* RESET: start over\n* ACTION1: move up\n* ACTION2: move down\n* ACTION3: move left\n* ACTION4: move right\n* ACTION5/ACTION6: no-ops\n\n# ORIENTATION (read carefully)\n* The global frame is fixed: the bottom-left KEY INDICATOR is always at the bottom-left; the EXIT/lock is elsewhere.\n* ACTION1 (UP) moves you toward the area where 15s (move counters) are located; use this as a compass for “up.”\n* ACTION4 (RIGHT) increases your distance from the bottom-left key indicator; ACTION3 (LEFT) decreases it.\n* Legality checks with 4s (walls):\n  - RIGHT is ILLEGAL if any 4s lie immediately to the right (“after” in row order) of any 12/9 cells of your 8×8 player.\n  - LEFT is ILLEGAL if any 4s lie immediately to the left (“before” in row order) of any 12/9 cells of your 8×8 player.\n  - UP is ILLEGAL if any 4s lie directly above the topmost 12 row of your player.\n  - DOWN is ILLEGAL if any 4s lie directly below the bottommost 9 row of your player.\n* Always orient carefully before moving: check where the 15s lie (for UP), how far you are from the bottom-left indicator (for LEFT/RIGHT), and whether 4s precede/follow your 12s/9s in the intended direction.\n\n# GOAL\nFind/generate a key that MATCHES the key pattern shown at the EXIT, then navigate to the EXIT to finish the level.\nThere are 6 levels total. Complete all levels to WIN.\n\n# TILE MEANINGS (important ones)\n* 0 = white cell (used in key patterns)\n* 3 = walkable path / corridor marker (often outlines routes to key/exit)\n* 4 = WALL (solid). You cannot enter 4s.\n* 5 = EXIT indicator (presence of 5s marks/frames the exit area)\n* 8 = LIFE token (count lives as the number of 2×2 blocks of 8s)\n* 9 = blue cells (used in player lower body; also appear elsewhere in the map and in key logic)\n* 12 = orange cells (used in player upper body)\n* 15 = MOVE counter (number of 15s ≈ moves/energy left)\n\n# PLAYER (sprite + movement legality)\n* The player is an 8×8 sprite made ONLY of 12s (top two rows) over 9s (bottom six rows).\n  - Concretely: rows 0–1 (relative to the sprite) are all 12s; rows 2–7 are all 9s.\n  - Other scattered 9s on the board are NOT the player—only the exact 8×8 (2×8 of 12s stacked on 6×8 of 9s) is the player.\n* Movement rules:\n  - You may move only through non-4 cells (i.e., never overlap a 4 after a move).\n  - If any part of your 8×8 sprite would overlap a 4 in the target direction (including cases where 4s lie “under” 9s), that move is ILLEGAL.\n  - If your sprite is already touching 4s on a side, you cannot move further in that touching direction until you have clearance.\n  - Practically: navigate corridors “between the 4s”.\n\n# KEYS, EXIT, AND HOW TO FIND THEM\n* Bottom-left KEY INDICATOR (non-interactive):\n  - A small block of 0s and 9s COMPLETELY BOXED by 4s in the bottom-left of the entire grid.\n  - This is NOT reachable and NOT a gameplay area. It only shows your CURRENT selected key.\n* EXIT (the lock to open):\n  - Elsewhere on the map, the lock is the target 0/9 pattern you must match, adjacent to some 5s (the 5s need not fully surround it).\n  - You may leave the level only when your current key EXACTLY matches this lock’s 0/9 distribution.\n* KEY GENERATOR (interactive, how to generate keys):\n  - Look for a patch consisting of 0s and 9s that has a CLEAR path of 3s leading to it and around it, and is NOT bordered by 5s or boxed by 4s.\n  - When any part of your 8×8 player steps ONTO this patch, it GENERATES a NEW candidate key and updates the bottom-left indicator.\n  - Step OFF the patch and then back ON to generate yet another candidate key; repeat to cycle through the set of keys.\n  - Continue cycling until the bottom-left indicator EXACTLY matches the lock pattern at the exit (the same 0/9 layout adjacent to 5s).\n* Locating things quickly:\n  - Generator: 0/9 patch accessible via 3s, with only 3s around it (no 5s), is almost certainly the generator.\n  - Exit: a matching 0/9 pattern near 5s marks the lock/exit area.\n\n# HUD / PROGRESSION\n* Visual score on the second-to-last grid row (row 62): it contains several 4-cell “slots”.\n  - Slots made of 3s represent UNFINISHED levels.\n  - When a slot changes from 3s to another color, that level is COMPLETE.\n* Track remaining MOVES/ENERGY by counting tiles with value 15.\n* Track LIVES by counting distinct 2×2 blocks of 8s.\n\n# GENERAL NOTES\n* The grid is a bird’s-eye view.\n* If the grid does not change after an action, you likely attempted an illegal move into 4s.\n* Favor routes marked by 3s; use the generator (0/9 patch surrounded by 3s) to cycle keys; confirm the match by comparing the bottom-left indicator (boxed by 4s) to the 0/9 lock pattern found near 5s; then proceed to the exit.\n\n# EXAMPLE STRATEGY OBSERVATION\nThe 8×8 player (top rows 12s, bottom rows 9s) is touching 4s on the left, so LEFT is blocked. I see a 0/9 patch with only 3s around it to the right—that’s likely the generator. I should move RIGHT to step on/off it until the bottom-left indicator (boxed by 4s) matches the lock pattern I see near the 5s, then head to the exit.\n\n# TURN:\nCall exactly one action.\n\n"

One Frame is made of one or more sequential\nGrids. Each Grid is a matrix size INT<0,63> by INT<0,63> filled with\nINT<0,15> values. Each value represents a different color and usually implies a different object.\n\nYou are playing a game called LockSmith.\n\n# CONTROLS\n* RESET: start over\n* ACTION1: move up\n* ACTION2: move down\n* ACTION3: move left\n* ACTION4: move right\n* ACTION5/ACTION6: no-ops\n\n# ORIENTATION (read carefully)\n* The global frame is fixed: the bottom-left KEY INDICATOR is always at the bottom-left; the EXIT/lock is elsewhere.\n* ACTION1 (UP) moves you toward the area where 15s (move counters) are located; use this as a compass for “up.”\n* ACTION4 (RIGHT) increases your distance from the bottom-left key indicator; ACTION3 (LEFT) decreases it.\n* Legality checks with 4s (walls):\n  - RIGHT is ILLEGAL if any 4s lie immediately to the right (“after” in row order) of any 12/9 cells of your 8×8 player.\n  - LEFT is ILLEGAL if any 4s lie immediately to the left (“before” in row order) of any 12/9 cells of your 8×8 player.\n  - UP is ILLEGAL if any 4s lie directly above the topmost 12 row of your player.\n  - DOWN is ILLEGAL if any 4s lie directly below the bottommost 9 row of your player.\n* Always orient carefully before moving: check where the 15s lie (for UP), how far you are from the bottom-left indicator (for LEFT/RIGHT), and whether 4s precede/follow your 12s/9s in the intended direction.\n\n# GOAL\nFind/generate a key that MATCHES the key pattern shown at the EXIT, then navigate to the EXIT to finish the level.\nThere are 6 levels total. Complete all levels to WIN.\n\n# TILE MEANINGS (important ones)\n* 0 = white cell (used in key patterns)\n* 3 = walkable path / corridor marker (often outlines routes to key/exit)\n* 4 = WALL (solid). You cannot enter 4s.\n* 5 = EXIT indicator (presence of 5s marks/frames the exit area)\n* 8 = LIFE token (count lives as the number of 2×2 blocks of 8s)\n* 9 = blue cells (used in player lower body; also appear elsewhere in the map and in key logic)\n* 12 = orange cells (used in player upper body)\n* 15 = MOVE counter (number of 15s ≈ moves/energy left)\n\n# PLAYER (sprite + movement legality)\n* The player is an 8×8 sprite made ONLY of 12s (top two rows) over 9s (bottom six rows).\n  - Concretely: rows 0–1 (relative to the sprite) are all 12s; rows 2–7 are all 9s.\n  - Other scattered 9s on the board are NOT the player—only the exact 8×8 (2×8 of 12s stacked on 6×8 of 9s) is the player.\n* Movement rules:\n  - You may move only through non-4 cells (i.e., never overlap a 4 after a move).\n  - If any part of your 8×8 sprite would overlap a 4 in the target direction (including cases where 4s lie “under” 9s), that move is ILLEGAL.\n  - If your sprite is already touching 4s on a side, you cannot move further in that touching direction until you have clearance.\n  - Practically: navigate corridors “between the 4s”.\n\n# KEYS, EXIT, AND HOW TO FIND THEM\n* Bottom-left KEY INDICATOR (non-interactive):\n  - A small block of 0s and 9s COMPLETELY BOXED by 4s in the bottom-left of the entire grid.\n  - This is NOT reachable and NOT a gameplay area. It only shows your CURRENT selected key.\n* EXIT (the lock to open):\n  - Elsewhere on the map, the lock is the target 0/9 pattern you must match, adjacent to some 5s (the 5s need not fully surround it).\n  - You may leave the level only when your current key EXACTLY matches this lock’s 0/9 distribution.\n* KEY GENERATOR (interactive, how to generate keys):\n  - Look for a patch consisting of 0s and 9s that has a CLEAR path of 3s leading to it and around it, and is NOT bordered by 5s or boxed by 4s.\n  - When any part of your 8×8 player steps ONTO this patch, it GENERATES a NEW candidate key and updates the bottom-left indicator.\n  - Step OFF the patch and then back ON to generate yet another candidate key; repeat to cycle through the set of keys.\n  - Continue cycling until the bottom-left indicator EXACTLY matches the lock pattern at the exit (the same 0/9 layout adjacent to 5s).\n* Locating things quickly:\n  - Generator: 0/9 patch accessible via 3s, with only 3s around it (no 5s), is almost certainly the generator.\n  - Exit: a matching 0/9 pattern near 5s marks the lock/exit area.\n\n# HUD / PROGRESSION\n* Visual score on the second-to-last grid row (row 62): it contains several 4-cell “slots”.\n  - Slots made of 3s represent UNFINISHED levels.\n  - When a slot changes from 3s to another color, that level is COMPLETE.\n* Track remaining MOVES/ENERGY by counting tiles with value 15.\n* Track LIVES by counting distinct 2×2 blocks of 8s.\n\n# GENERAL NOTES\n* The grid is a bird’s-eye view.\n* If the grid does not change after an action, you likely attempted an illegal move into 4s.\n* Favor routes marked by 3s; use the generator (0/9 patch surrounded by 3s) to cycle keys; confirm the match by comparing the bottom-left indicator (boxed by 4s) to the 0/9 lock pattern found near 5s; then proceed to the exit.\n\n# EXAMPLE STRATEGY OBSERVATION\nThe 8×8 player (top rows 12s, bottom rows 9s) is touching 4s on the left, so LEFT is blocked. I see a 0/9 patch with only 3s around it to the right—that’s likely the generator. I should move RIGHT to step on/off it until the bottom-left indicator (boxed by 4s) matches the lock pattern I see near the 5s, then head to the exit.\n\n# TURN:\nCall exactly one action.\n\n"

    "content": "\n# CONTEXT:\nYou are an agent playing a dynamic game. Your objective is to\nWIN and avoid GAME_OVER while minimizing actions.\n\nOne action produces one Frame. One Frame is made of one or more sequential\nGrids. Each Grid is a matrix size INT<0,63> by INT<0,63> filled with\nINT<0,15> values. Each value represents a different color and usually implies a different object.\n\nYou are playing a game called LockSmith.\n\n# CONTROLS\n* RESET: start over\n* ACTION1: move up\n* ACTION2: move down\n* ACTION3: move left\n* ACTION4: move right\n* ACTION5/ACTION6: no-ops\n\n# ORIENTATION (read carefully)\n* The global frame is fixed: the bottom-left KEY INDICATOR is always at the bottom-left; the EXIT/lock is elsewhere.\n* ACTION1 (UP) moves you toward the area where 15s (move counters) are located; use this as a compass for “up.”\n* ACTION4 (RIGHT) increases your distance from the bottom-left key indicator; ACTION3 (LEFT) decreases it.\n* Legality checks with 4s (walls):\n  - RIGHT is ILLEGAL if any 4s lie immediately to the right (“after” in row order) of any 12/9 cells of your 8×8 player.\n  - LEFT is ILLEGAL if any 4s lie immediately to the left (“before” in row order) of any 12/9 cells of your 8×8 player.\n  - UP is ILLEGAL if any 4s lie directly above the topmost 12 row of your player.\n  - DOWN is ILLEGAL if any 4s lie directly below the bottommost 9 row of your player.\n* Always orient carefully before moving: check where the 15s lie (for UP), how far you are from the bottom-left indicator (for LEFT/RIGHT), and whether 4s precede/follow your 12s/9s in the intended direction.\n\n# GOAL\nFind/generate a key that MATCHES the key pattern shown at the EXIT, then navigate to the EXIT to finish the level.\nThere are 6 levels total. Complete all levels to WIN.\n\n# TILE MEANINGS (important ones)\n* 0 = white cell (used in key patterns)\n* 3 = walkable path / corridor marker (often outlines routes to key/exit)\n* 4 = WALL (solid). You cannot enter 4s.\n* 5 = EXIT indicator (presence of 5s marks/frames the exit area)\n* 8 = LIFE token (count lives as the number of 2×2 blocks of 8s)\n* 9 = blue cells (used in player lower body; also appear elsewhere in the map and in key logic)\n* 12 = orange cells (used in player upper body)\n* 15 = MOVE counter (number of 15s ≈ moves/energy left)\n\n# PLAYER (sprite + movement legality)\n* The player is an 8×8 sprite made ONLY of 12s (top two rows) over 9s (bottom six rows).\n  - Concretely: rows 0–1 (relative to the sprite) are all 12s; rows 2–7 are all 9s.\n  - Other scattered 9s on the board are NOT the player—only the exact 8×8 (2×8 of 12s stacked on 6×8 of 9s) is the player.\n* Movement rules:\n  - You may move only through non-4 cells (i.e., never overlap a 4 after a move).\n  - If any part of your 8×8 sprite would overlap a 4 in the target direction (including cases where 4s lie “under” 9s), that move is ILLEGAL.\n  - If your sprite is already touching 4s on a side, you cannot move further in that touching direction until you have clearance.\n  - Practically: navigate corridors “between the 4s”.\n\n# KEYS, EXIT, AND HOW TO FIND THEM\n* Bottom-left KEY INDICATOR (non-interactive):\n  - A small block of 0s and 9s COMPLETELY BOXED by 4s in the bottom-left of the entire grid.\n  - This is NOT reachable and NOT a gameplay area. It only shows your CURRENT selected key.\n* EXIT (the lock to open):\n  - Elsewhere on the map, the lock is the target 0/9 pattern you must match, adjacent to some 5s (the 5s need not fully surround it).\n  - You may leave the level only when your current key EXACTLY matches this lock’s 0/9 distribution.\n* KEY GENERATOR (interactive, how to generate keys):\n  - Look for a patch consisting of 0s and 9s that has a CLEAR path of 3s leading to it and around it, and is NOT bordered by 5s or boxed by 4s.\n  - When any part of your 8×8 player steps ONTO this patch, it GENERATES a NEW candidate key and updates the bottom-left indicator.\n  - Step OFF the patch and then back ON to generate yet another candidate key; repeat to cycle through the set of keys.\n  - Continue cycling until the bottom-left indicator EXACTLY matches the lock pattern at the exit (the same 0/9 layout adjacent to 5s).\n* Locating things quickly:\n  - Generator: 0/9 patch accessible via 3s, with only 3s around it (no 5s), is almost certainly the generator.\n  - Exit: a matching 0/9 pattern near 5s marks the lock/exit area.\n\n# HUD / PROGRESSION\n* Visual score on the second-to-last grid row (row 62): it contains several 4-cell “slots”.\n  - Slots made of 3s represent UNFINISHED levels.\n  - When a slot changes from 3s to another color, that level is COMPLETE.\n* Track remaining MOVES/ENERGY by counting tiles with value 15.\n* Track LIVES by counting distinct 2×2 blocks of 8s.\n\n# GENERAL NOTES\n* The grid is a bird’s-eye view.\n* If the grid does not change after an action, you likely attempted an illegal move into 4s.\n* Favor routes marked by 3s; use the generator (0/9 patch surrounded by 3s) to cycle keys; confirm the match by comparing the bottom-left indicator (boxed by 4s) to the 0/9 lock pattern found near 5s; then proceed to the exit.\n\n# EXAMPLE STRATEGY OBSERVATION\nThe 8×8 player (top rows 12s, bottom rows 9s) is touching 4s on the left, so LEFT is blocked. I see a 0/9 patch with only 3s around it to the right—that’s likely the generator. I should move RIGHT to step on/off it until the bottom-left indicator (boxed by 4s) matches the lock pattern I see near the 5s, then head to the exit.\n\n# TURN:\nCall exactly one action.\n\n"

    "content": "\n# CONTEXT:\nYou are an agent playing a dynamic game. Your objective is to\nWIN and avoid GAME_OVER while minimizing actions.\n\nOne action produces one Frame. One Frame is made of one or more sequential\nGrids. Each Grid is a matrix size INT<0,63> by INT<0,63> filled with\nINT<0,15> values. Each value represents a different color and usually implies a different object.\n\nYou are playing a game called LockSmith.\n\n# CONTROLS\n* RESET: start over\n* ACTION1: move up\n* ACTION2: move down\n* ACTION3: move left\n* ACTION4: move right\n* ACTION5/ACTION6: no-ops\n\n# ORIENTATION (read carefully)\n* The global frame is fixed: the bottom-left KEY INDICATOR is always at the bottom-left; the EXIT/lock is elsewhere.\n* ACTION1 (UP) moves you toward the area where 15s (move counters) are located; use this as a compass for “up.”\n* ACTION4 (RIGHT) increases your distance from the bottom-left key indicator; ACTION3 (LEFT) decreases it.\n* Legality checks with 4s (walls):\n  - RIGHT is ILLEGAL if any 4s lie immediately to the right (“after” in row order) of any 12/9 cells of your 8×8 player.\n  - LEFT is ILLEGAL if any 4s lie immediately to the left (“before” in row order) of any 12/9 cells of your 8×8 player.\n  - UP is ILLEGAL if any 4s lie directly above the topmost 12 row of your player.\n  - DOWN is ILLEGAL if any 4s lie directly below the bottommost 9 row of your player.\n* Always orient carefully before moving: check where the 15s lie (for UP), how far you are from the bottom-left indicator (for LEFT/RIGHT), and whether 4s precede/follow your 12s/9s in the intended direction.\n\n# GOAL\nFind/generate a key that MATCHES the key pattern shown at the EXIT, then navigate to the EXIT to finish the level.\nThere are 6 levels total. Complete all levels to WIN.\n\n# TILE MEANINGS (important ones)\n* 0 = white cell (used in key patterns)\n* 3 = walkable path / corridor marker (often outlines routes to key/exit)\n* 4 = WALL (solid). You cannot enter 4s.\n* 5 = EXIT indicator (presence of 5s marks/frames the exit area)\n* 8 = LIFE token (count lives as the number of 2×2 blocks of 8s)\n* 9 = blue cells (used in player lower body; also appear elsewhere in the map and in key logic)\n* 12 = orange cells (used in player upper body)\n* 15 = MOVE counter (number of 15s ≈ moves/energy left)\n\n# PLAYER (sprite + movement legality)\n* The player is an 8×8 sprite made ONLY of 12s (top two rows) over 9s (bottom six rows).\n  - Concretely: rows 0–1 (relative to the sprite) are all 12s; rows 2–7 are all 9s.\n  - Other scattered 9s on the board are NOT the player—only the exact 8×8 (2×8 of 12s stacked on 6×8 of 9s) is the player.\n* Movement rules:\n  - You may move only through non-4 cells (i.e., never overlap a 4 after a move).\n  - If any part of your 8×8 sprite would overlap a 4 in the target direction (including cases where 4s lie “under” 9s), that move is ILLEGAL.\n  - If your sprite is already touching 4s on a side, you cannot move further in that touching direction until you have clearance.\n  - Practically: navigate corridors “between the 4s”.\n\n# KEYS, EXIT, AND HOW TO FIND THEM\n* Bottom-left KEY INDICATOR (non-interactive):\n  - A small block of 0s and 9s COMPLETELY BOXED by 4s in the bottom-left of the entire grid.\n  - This is NOT reachable and NOT a gameplay area. It only shows your CURRENT selected key.\n* EXIT (the lock to open):\n  - Elsewhere on the map, the lock is the target 0/9 pattern you must match, adjacent to some 5s (the 5s need not fully surround it).\n  - You may leave the level only when your current key EXACTLY matches this lock’s 0/9 distribution.\n* KEY GENERATOR (interactive, how to generate keys):\n  - Look for a patch consisting of 0s and 9s that has a CLEAR path of 3s leading to it and around it, and is NOT bordered by 5s or boxed by 4s.\n  - When any part of your 8×8 player steps ONTO this patch, it GENERATES a NEW candidate key and updates the bottom-left indicator.\n  - Step OFF the patch and then back ON to generate yet another candidate key; repeat to cycle through the set of keys.\n  - Continue cycling until the bottom-left indicator EXACTLY matches the lock pattern at the exit (the same 0/9 layout adjacent to 5s).\n* Locating things quickly:\n  - Generator: 0/9 patch accessible via 3s, with only 3s around it (no 5s), is almost certainly the generator.\n  - Exit: a matching 0/9 pattern near 5s marks the lock/exit area.\n\n# HUD / PROGRESSION\n* Visual score on the second-to-last grid row (row 62): it contains several 4-cell “slots”.\n  - Slots made of 3s represent UNFINISHED levels.\n  - When a slot changes from 3s to another color, that level is COMPLETE.\n* Track remaining MOVES/ENERGY by counting tiles with value 15.\n* Track LIVES by counting distinct 2×2 blocks of 8s.\n\n# GENERAL NOTES\n* The grid is a bird’s-eye view.\n* If the grid does not change after an action, you likely attempted an illegal move into 4s.\n* Favor routes marked by 3s; use the generator (0/9 patch surrounded by 3s) to cycle keys; confirm the match by comparing the bottom-left indicator (boxed by 4s) to the 0/9 lock pattern found near 5s; then proceed to the exit.\n\n# EXAMPLE STRATEGY OBSERVATION\nThe 8×8 player (top rows 12s, bottom rows 9s) is touching 4s on the left, so LEFT is blocked. I see a 0/9 patch with only 3s around it to the right—that’s likely the generator. I should move RIGHT to step on/off it until the bottom-left indicator (boxed by 4s) matches the lock pattern I see near the 5s, then head to the exit.\n\n# TURN:\nCall exactly one action.\n\n"

    "content": "\n# CONTEXT:\nYou are an agent playing a dynamic game. Your objective is to\nWIN and avoid GAME_OVER while minimizing actions.\n\nOne action produces one Frame. One Frame is made of one or more sequential\nGrids. Each Grid is a matrix size INT<0,63> by INT<0,63> filled with\nINT<0,15> values. Each value represents a different color and usually implies a different object.\n\nYou are playing a game called LockSmith.\n\n# CONTROLS\n* RESET: start over\n* ACTION1: move up\n* ACTION2: move down\n* ACTION3: move left\n* ACTION4: move right\n* ACTION5/ACTION6: no-ops\n\n# ORIENTATION (read carefully)\n* The global frame is fixed: the bottom-left KEY INDICATOR is always at the bottom-left; the EXIT/lock is elsewhere.\n* ACTION1 (UP) moves you toward the area where 15s (move counters) are located; use this as a compass for “up.”\n* ACTION4 (RIGHT) increases your distance from the bottom-left key indicator; ACTION3 (LEFT) decreases it.\n* Legality checks with 4s (walls):\n  - RIGHT is ILLEGAL if any 4s lie immediately to the right (“after” in row order) of any 12/9 cells of your 8×8 player.\n  - LEFT is ILLEGAL if any 4s lie immediately to the left (“before” in row order) of any 12/9 cells of your 8×8 player.\n  - UP is ILLEGAL if any 4s lie directly above the topmost 12 row of your player.\n  - DOWN is ILLEGAL if any 4s lie directly below the bottommost 9 row of your player.\n* Always orient carefully before moving: check where the 15s lie (for UP), how far you are from the bottom-left indicator (for LEFT/RIGHT), and whether 4s precede/follow your 12s/9s in the intended direction.\n\n# GOAL\nFind/generate a key that MATCHES the key pattern shown at the EXIT, then navigate to the EXIT to finish the level.\nThere are 6 levels total. Complete all levels to WIN.\n\n# TILE MEANINGS (important ones)\n* 0 = white cell (used in key patterns)\n* 3 = walkable path / corridor marker (often outlines routes to key/exit)\n* 4 = WALL (solid). You cannot enter 4s.\n* 5 = EXIT indicator (presence of 5s marks/frames the exit area)\n* 8 = LIFE token (count lives as the number of 2×2 blocks of 8s)\n* 9 = blue cells (used in player lower body; also appear elsewhere in the map and in key logic)\n* 12 = orange cells (used in player upper body)\n* 15 = MOVE counter (number of 15s ≈ moves/energy left)\n\n# PLAYER (sprite + movement legality)\n* The player is an 8×8 sprite made ONLY of 12s (top two rows) over 9s (bottom six rows).\n  - Concretely: rows 0–1 (relative to the sprite) are all 12s; rows 2–7 are all 9s.\n  - Other scattered 9s on the board are NOT the player—only the exact 8×8 (2×8 of 12s stacked on 6×8 of 9s) is the player.\n* Movement rules:\n  - You may move only through non-4 cells (i.e., never overlap a 4 after a move).\n  - If any part of your 8×8 sprite would overlap a 4 in the target direction (including cases where 4s lie “under” 9s), that move is ILLEGAL.\n  - If your sprite is already touching 4s on a side, you cannot move further in that touching direction until you have clearance.\n  - Practically: navigate corridors “between the 4s”.\n\n# KEYS, EXIT, AND HOW TO FIND THEM\n* Bottom-left KEY INDICATOR (non-interactive):\n  - A small block of 0s and 9s COMPLETELY BOXED by 4s in the bottom-left of the entire grid.\n  - This is NOT reachable and NOT a gameplay area. It only shows your CURRENT selected key.\n* EXIT (the lock to open):\n  - Elsewhere on the map, the lock is the target 0/9 pattern you must match, adjacent to some 5s (the 5s need not fully surround it).\n  - You may leave the level only when your current key EXACTLY matches this lock’s 0/9 distribution.\n* KEY GENERATOR (interactive, how to generate keys):\n  - Look for a patch consisting of 0s and 9s that has a CLEAR path of 3s leading to it and around it, and is NOT bordered by 5s or boxed by 4s.\n  - When any part of your 8×8 player steps ONTO this patch, it GENERATES a NEW candidate key and updates the bottom-left indicator.\n  - Step OFF the patch and then back ON to generate yet another candidate key; repeat to cycle through the set of keys.\n  - Continue cycling until the bottom-left indicator EXACTLY matches the lock pattern at the exit (the same 0/9 layout adjacent to 5s).\n* Locating things quickly:\n  - Generator: 0/9 patch accessible via 3s, with only 3s around it (no 5s), is almost certainly the generator.\n  - Exit: a matching 0/9 pattern near 5s marks the lock/exit area.\n\n# HUD / PROGRESSION\n* Visual score on the second-to-last grid row (row 62): it contains several 4-cell “slots”.\n  - Slots made of 3s represent UNFINISHED levels.\n  - When a slot changes from 3s to another color, that level is COMPLETE.\n* Track remaining MOVES/ENERGY by counting tiles with value 15.\n* Track LIVES by counting distinct 2×2 blocks of 8s.\n\n# GENERAL NOTES\n* The grid is a bird’s-eye view.\n* If the grid does not change after an action, you likely attempted an illegal move into 4s.\n* Favor routes marked by 3s; use the generator (0/9 patch surrounded by 3s) to cycle keys; confirm the match by comparing the bottom-left indicator (boxed by 4s) to the 0/9 lock pattern found near 5s; then proceed to the exit.\n\n# EXAMPLE STRATEGY OBSERVATION\nThe 8×8 player (top rows 12s, bottom rows 9s) is touching 4s on the left, so LEFT is blocked. I see a 0/9 patch with only 3s around it to the right—that’s likely the generator. I should move RIGHT to step on/off it until the bottom-left indicator (boxed by 4s) matches the lock pattern I see near the 5s, then head to the exit.\n\n# TURN:\nCall exactly one action.\n\n"

    "content": "\n# CONTEXT:\nYou are an agent playing a dynamic game. Your objective is to\nWIN and avoid GAME_OVER while minimizing actions.\n\nOne action produces one Frame. One Frame is made of one or more sequential\nGrids. Each Grid is a matrix size INT<0,63> by INT<0,63> filled with\nINT<0,15> values. Each value represents a different color and usually implies a different object.\n\nYou are playing a game called LockSmith.\n\n# CONTROLS\n* RESET: start over\n* ACTION1: move up\n* ACTION2: move down\n* ACTION3: move left\n* ACTION4: move right\n* ACTION5/ACTION6: no-ops\n\n# ORIENTATION (read carefully)\n* The global frame is fixed: the bottom-left KEY INDICATOR is always at the bottom-left; the EXIT/lock is elsewhere.\n* ACTION1 (UP) moves you toward the area where 15s (move counters) are located; use this as a compass for “up.”\n* ACTION4 (RIGHT) increases your distance from the bottom-left key indicator; ACTION3 (LEFT) decreases it.\n* Legality checks with 4s (walls):\n  - RIGHT is ILLEGAL if any 4s lie immediately to the right (“after” in row order) of any 12/9 cells of your 8×8 player.\n  - LEFT is ILLEGAL if any 4s lie immediately to the left (“before” in row order) of any 12/9 cells of your 8×8 player.\n  - UP is ILLEGAL if any 4s lie directly above the topmost 12 row of your player.\n  - DOWN is ILLEGAL if any 4s lie directly below the bottommost 9 row of your player.\n* Always orient carefully before moving: check where the 15s lie (for UP), how far you are from the bottom-left indicator (for LEFT/RIGHT), and whether 4s precede/follow your 12s/9s in the intended direction.\n\n# GOAL\nFind/generate a key that MATCHES the key pattern shown at the EXIT, then navigate to the EXIT to finish the level.\nThere are 6 levels total. Complete all levels to WIN.\n\n# TILE MEANINGS (important ones)\n* 0 = white cell (used in key patterns)\n* 3 = walkable path / corridor marker (often outlines routes to key/exit)\n* 4 = WALL (solid). You cannot enter 4s.\n* 5 = EXIT indicator (presence of 5s marks/frames the exit area)\n* 8 = LIFE token (count lives as the number of 2×2 blocks of 8s)\n* 9 = blue cells (used in player lower body; also appear elsewhere in the map and in key logic)\n* 12 = orange cells (used in player upper body)\n* 15 = MOVE counter (number of 15s ≈ moves/energy left)\n\n# PLAYER (sprite + movement legality)\n* The player is an 8×8 sprite made ONLY of 12s (top two rows) over 9s (bottom six rows).\n  - Concretely: rows 0–1 (relative to the sprite) are all 12s; rows 2–7 are all 9s.\n  - Other scattered 9s on the board are NOT the player—only the exact 8×8 (2×8 of 12s stacked on 6×8 of 9s) is the player.\n* Movement rules:\n  - You may move only through non-4 cells (i.e., never overlap a 4 after a move).\n  - If any part of your 8×8 sprite would overlap a 4 in the target direction (including cases where 4s lie “under” 9s), that move is ILLEGAL.\n  - If your sprite is already touching 4s on a side, you cannot move further in that touching direction until you have clearance.\n  - Practically: navigate corridors “between the 4s”.\n\n# KEYS, EXIT, AND HOW TO FIND THEM\n* Bottom-left KEY INDICATOR (non-interactive):\n  - A small block of 0s and 9s COMPLETELY BOXED by 4s in the bottom-left of the entire grid.\n  - This is NOT reachable and NOT a gameplay area. It only shows your CURRENT selected key.\n* EXIT (the lock to open):\n  - Elsewhere on the map, the lock is the target 0/9 pattern you must match, adjacent to some 5s (the 5s need not fully surround it).\n  - You may leave the level only when your current key EXACTLY matches this lock’s 0/9 distribution.\n* KEY GENERATOR (interactive, how to generate keys):\n  - Look for a patch consisting of 0s and 9s that has a CLEAR path of 3s leading to it and around it, and is NOT bordered by 5s or boxed by 4s.\n  - When any part of your 8×8 player steps ONTO this patch, it GENERATES a NEW candidate key and updates the bottom-left indicator.\n  - Step OFF the patch and then back ON to generate yet another candidate key; repeat to cycle through the set of keys.\n  - Continue cycling until the bottom-left indicator EXACTLY matches the lock pattern at the exit (the same 0/9 layout adjacent to 5s).\n* Locating things quickly:\n  - Generator: 0/9 patch accessible via 3s, with only 3s around it (no 5s), is almost certainly the generator.\n  - Exit: a matching 0/9 pattern near 5s marks the lock/exit area.\n\n# HUD / PROGRESSION\n* Visual score on the second-to-last grid row (row 62): it contains several 4-cell “slots”.\n  - Slots made of 3s represent UNFINISHED levels.\n  - When a slot changes from 3s to another color, that level is COMPLETE.\n* Track remaining MOVES/ENERGY by counting tiles with value 15.\n* Track LIVES by counting distinct 2×2 blocks of 8s.\n\n# GENERAL NOTES\n* The grid is a bird’s-eye view.\n* If the grid does not change after an action, you likely attempted an illegal move into 4s.\n* Favor routes marked by 3s; use the generator (0/9 patch surrounded by 3s) to cycle keys; confirm the match by comparing the bottom-left indicator (boxed by 4s) to the 0/9 lock pattern found near 5s; then proceed to the exit.\n\n# EXAMPLE STRATEGY OBSERVATION\nThe 8×8 player (top rows 12s, bottom rows 9s) is touching 4s on the left, so LEFT is blocked. I see a 0/9 patch with only 3s around it to the right—that’s likely the generator. I should move RIGHT to step on/off it until the bottom-left indicator (boxed by 4s) matches the lock pattern I see near the 5s, then head to the exit.\n\n# TURN:\nCall exactly one action.\n\n"

    "content": "\n# CONTEXT:\nYou are an agent playing a dynamic game. Your objective is to\nWIN and avoid GAME_OVER while minimizing actions.\n\nOne action produces one Frame. One Frame is made of one or more sequential\nGrids. Each Grid is a matrix size INT<0,63> by INT<0,63> filled with\nINT<0,15> values. Each value represents a different color and usually implies a different object.\n\nYou are playing a game called LockSmith.\n\n# CONTROLS\n* RESET: start over\n* ACTION1: move up\n* ACTION2: move down\n* ACTION3: move left\n* ACTION4: move right\n* ACTION5/ACTION6: no-ops\n\n# ORIENTATION (read carefully)\n* The global frame is fixed: the bottom-left KEY INDICATOR is always at the bottom-left; the EXIT/lock is elsewhere.\n* ACTION1 (UP) moves you toward the area where 15s (move counters) are located; use this as a compass for “up.”\n* ACTION4 (RIGHT) increases your distance from the bottom-left key indicator; ACTION3 (LEFT) decreases it.\n* Legality checks with 4s (walls):\n  - RIGHT is ILLEGAL if any 4s lie immediately to the right (“after” in row order) of any 12/9 cells of your 8×8 player.\n  - LEFT is ILLEGAL if any 4s lie immediately to the left (“before” in row order) of any 12/9 cells of your 8×8 player.\n  - UP is ILLEGAL if any 4s lie directly above the topmost 12 row of your player.\n  - DOWN is ILLEGAL if any 4s lie directly below the bottommost 9 row of your player.\n* Always orient carefully before moving: check where the 15s lie (for UP), how far you are from the bottom-left indicator (for LEFT/RIGHT), and whether 4s precede/follow your 12s/9s in the intended direction.\n\n# GOAL\nFind/generate a key that MATCHES the key pattern shown at the EXIT, then navigate to the EXIT to finish the level.\nThere are 6 levels total. Complete all levels to WIN.\n\n# TILE MEANINGS (important ones)\n* 0 = white cell (used in key patterns)\n* 3 = walkable path / corridor marker (often outlines routes to key/exit)\n* 4 = WALL (solid). You cannot enter 4s.\n* 5 = EXIT indicator (presence of 5s marks/frames the exit area)\n* 8 = LIFE token (count lives as the number of 2×2 blocks of 8s)\n* 9 = blue cells (used in player lower body; also appear elsewhere in the map and in key logic)\n* 12 = orange cells (used in player upper body)\n* 15 = MOVE counter (number of 15s ≈ moves/energy left)\n\n# PLAYER (sprite + movement legality)\n* The player is an 8×8 sprite made ONLY of 12s (top two rows) over 9s (bottom six rows).\n  - Concretely: rows 0–1 (relative to the sprite) are all 12s; rows 2–7 are all 9s.\n  - Other scattered 9s on the board are NOT the player—only the exact 8×8 (2×8 of 12s stacked on 6×8 of 9s) is the player.\n* Movement rules:\n  - You may move only through non-4 cells (i.e., never overlap a 4 after a move).\n  - If any part of your 8×8 sprite would overlap a 4 in the target direction (including cases where 4s lie “under” 9s), that move is ILLEGAL.\n  - If your sprite is already touching 4s on a side, you cannot move further in that touching direction until you have clearance.\n  - Practically: navigate corridors “between the 4s”.\n\n# KEYS, EXIT, AND HOW TO FIND THEM\n* Bottom-left KEY INDICATOR (non-interactive):\n  - A small block of 0s and 9s COMPLETELY BOXED by 4s in the bottom-left of the entire grid.\n  - This is NOT reachable and NOT a gameplay area. It only shows your CURRENT selected key.\n* EXIT (the lock to open):\n  - Elsewhere on the map, the lock is the target 0/9 pattern you must match, adjacent to some 5s (the 5s need not fully surround it).\n  - You may leave the level only when your current key EXACTLY matches this lock’s 0/9 distribution.\n* KEY GENERATOR (interactive, how to generate keys):\n  - Look for a patch consisting of 0s and 9s that has a CLEAR path of 3s leading to it and around it, and is NOT bordered by 5s or boxed by 4s.\n  - When any part of your 8×8 player steps ONTO this patch, it GENERATES a NEW candidate key and updates the bottom-left indicator.\n  - Step OFF the patch and then back ON to generate yet another candidate key; repeat to cycle through the set of keys.\n  - Continue cycling until the bottom-left indicator EXACTLY matches the lock pattern at the exit (the same 0/9 layout adjacent to 5s).\n* Locating things quickly:\n  - Generator: 0/9 patch accessible via 3s, with only 3s around it (no 5s), is almost certainly the generator.\n  - Exit: a matching 0/9 pattern near 5s marks the lock/exit area.\n\n# HUD / PROGRESSION\n* Visual score on the second-to-last grid row (row 62): it contains several 4-cell “slots”.\n  - Slots made of 3s represent UNFINISHED levels.\n  - When a slot changes from 3s to another color, that level is COMPLETE.\n* Track remaining MOVES/ENERGY by counting tiles with value 15.\n* Track LIVES by counting distinct 2×2 blocks of 8s.\n\n# GENERAL NOTES\n* The grid is a bird’s-eye view.\n* If the grid does not change after an action, you likely attempted an illegal move into 4s.\n* Favor routes marked by 3s; use the generator (0/9 patch surrounded by 3s) to cycle keys; confirm the match by comparing the bottom-left indicator (boxed by 4s) to the 0/9 lock pattern found near 5s; then proceed to the exit.\n\n# EXAMPLE STRATEGY OBSERVATION\nThe 8×8 player (top rows 12s, bottom rows 9s) is touching 4s on the left, so LEFT is blocked. I see a 0/9 patch with only 3s around it to the right—that’s likely the generator. I should move RIGHT to step on/off it until the bottom-left indicator (boxed by 4s) matches the lock pattern I see near the 5s, then head to the exit.\n\n# TURN:\nCall exactly one action.\n\n"

    "content": "\n# CONTEXT:\nYou are an agent playing a dynamic game. Your objective is to\nWIN and avoid GAME_OVER while minimizing actions.\n\nOne action produces one Frame. One Frame is made of one or more sequential\nGrids. Each Grid is a matrix size INT<0,63> by INT<0,63> filled with\nINT<0,15> values. Each value represents a different color and usually implies a different object.\n\nYou are playing a game called LockSmith.\n\n# CONTROLS\n* RESET: start over\n* ACTION1: move up\n* ACTION2: move down\n* ACTION3: move left\n* ACTION4: move right\n* ACTION5/ACTION6: no-ops\n\n# ORIENTATION (read carefully)\n* The global frame is fixed: the bottom-left KEY INDICATOR is always at the bottom-left; the EXIT/lock is elsewhere.\n* ACTION1 (UP) moves you toward the area where 15s (move counters) are located; use this as a compass for “up.”\n* ACTION4 (RIGHT) increases your distance from the bottom-left key indicator; ACTION3 (LEFT) decreases it.\n* Legality checks with 4s (walls):\n  - RIGHT is ILLEGAL if any 4s lie immediately to the right (“after” in row order) of any 12/9 cells of your 8×8 player.\n  - LEFT is ILLEGAL if any 4s lie immediately to the left (“before” in row order) of any 12/9 cells of your 8×8 player.\n  - UP is ILLEGAL if any 4s lie directly above the topmost 12 row of your player.\n  - DOWN is ILLEGAL if any 4s lie directly below the bottommost 9 row of your player.\n* Always orient carefully before moving: check where the 15s lie (for UP), how far you are from the bottom-left indicator (for LEFT/RIGHT), and whether 4s precede/follow your 12s/9s in the intended direction.\n\n# GOAL\nFind/generate a key that MATCHES the key pattern shown at the EXIT, then navigate to the EXIT to finish the level.\nThere are 6 levels total. Complete all levels to WIN.\n\n# TILE MEANINGS (important ones)\n* 0 = white cell (used in key patterns)\n* 3 = walkable path / corridor marker (often outlines routes to key/exit)\n* 4 = WALL (solid). You cannot enter 4s.\n* 5 = EXIT indicator (presence of 5s marks/frames the exit area)\n* 8 = LIFE token (count lives as the number of 2×2 blocks of 8s)\n* 9 = blue cells (used in player lower body; also appear elsewhere in the map and in key logic)\n* 12 = orange cells (used in player upper body)\n* 15 = MOVE counter (number of 15s ≈ moves/energy left)\n\n# PLAYER (sprite + movement legality)\n* The player is an 8×8 sprite made ONLY of 12s (top two rows) over 9s (bottom six rows).\n  - Concretely: rows 0–1 (relative to the sprite) are all 12s; rows 2–7 are all 9s.\n  - Other scattered 9s on the board are NOT the player—only the exact 8×8 (2×8 of 12s stacked on 6×8 of 9s) is the player.\n* Movement rules:\n  - You may move only through non-4 cells (i.e., never overlap a 4 after a move).\n  - If any part of your 8×8 sprite would overlap a 4 in the target direction (including cases where 4s lie “under” 9s), that move is ILLEGAL.\n  - If your sprite is already touching 4s on a side, you cannot move further in that touching direction until you have clearance.\n  - Practically: navigate corridors “between the 4s”.\n\n# KEYS, EXIT, AND HOW TO FIND THEM\n* Bottom-left KEY INDICATOR (non-interactive):\n  - A small block of 0s and 9s COMPLETELY BOXED by 4s in the bottom-left of the entire grid.\n  - This is NOT reachable and NOT a gameplay area. It only shows your CURRENT selected key.\n* EXIT (the lock to open):\n  - Elsewhere on the map, the lock is the target 0/9 pattern you must match, adjacent to some 5s (the 5s need not fully surround it).\n  - You may leave the level only when your current key EXACTLY matches this lock’s 0/9 distribution.\n* KEY GENERATOR (interactive, how to generate keys):\n  - Look for a patch consisting of 0s and 9s that has a CLEAR path of 3s leading to it and around it, and is NOT bordered by 5s or boxed by 4s.\n  - When any part of your 8×8 player steps ONTO this patch, it GENERATES a NEW candidate key and updates the bottom-left indicator.\n  - Step OFF the patch and then back ON to generate yet another candidate key; repeat to cycle through the set of keys.\n  - Continue cycling until the bottom-left indicator EXACTLY matches the lock pattern at the exit (the same 0/9 layout adjacent to 5s).\n* Locating things quickly:\n  - Generator: 0/9 patch accessible via 3s, with only 3s around it (no 5s), is almost certainly the generator.\n  - Exit: a matching 0/9 pattern near 5s marks the lock/exit area.\n\n# HUD / PROGRESSION\n* Visual score on the second-to-last grid row (row 62): it contains several 4-cell “slots”.\n  - Slots made of 3s represent UNFINISHED levels.\n  - When a slot changes from 3s to another color, that level is COMPLETE.\n* Track remaining MOVES/ENERGY by counting tiles with value 15.\n* Track LIVES by counting distinct 2×2 blocks of 8s.\n\n# GENERAL NOTES\n* The grid is a bird’s-eye view.\n* If the grid does not change after an action, you likely attempted an illegal move into 4s.\n* Favor routes marked by 3s; use the generator (0/9 patch surrounded by 3s) to cycle keys; confirm the match by comparing the bottom-left indicator (boxed by 4s) to the 0/9 lock pattern found near 5s; then proceed to the exit.\n\n# EXAMPLE STRATEGY OBSERVATION\nThe 8×8 player (top rows 12s, bottom rows 9s) is touching 4s on the left, so LEFT is blocked. I see a 0/9 patch with only 3s around it to the right—that’s likely the generator. I should move RIGHT to step on/off it until the bottom-left indicator (boxed by 4s) matches the lock pattern I see near the 5s, then head to the exit.\n\n# TURN:\nCall exactly one action.\n\n"

    "content": "\n# CONTEXT:\nYou are an agent playing a dynamic game. Your objective is to\nWIN and avoid GAME_OVER while minimizing actions.\n\nOne action produces one Frame. One Frame is made of one or more sequential\nGrids. Each Grid is a matrix size INT<0,63> by INT<0,63> filled with\nINT<0,15> values. Each value represents a different color and usually implies a different object.\n\nYou are playing a game called LockSmith.\n\n# CONTROLS\n* RESET: start over\n* ACTION1: move up\n* ACTION2: move down\n* ACTION3: move left\n* ACTION4: move right\n* ACTION5/ACTION6: no-ops\n\n# ORIENTATION (read carefully)\n* The global frame is fixed: the bottom-left KEY INDICATOR is always at the bottom-left; the EXIT/lock is elsewhere.\n* ACTION1 (UP) moves you toward the area where 15s (move counters) are located; use this as a compass for “up.”\n* ACTION4 (RIGHT) increases your distance from the bottom-left key indicator; ACTION3 (LEFT) decreases it.\n* Legality checks with 4s (walls):\n  - RIGHT is ILLEGAL if any 4s lie immediately to the right (“after” in row order) of any 12/9 cells of your 8×8 player.\n  - LEFT is ILLEGAL if any 4s lie immediately to the left (“before” in row order) of any 12/9 cells of your 8×8 player.\n  - UP is ILLEGAL if any 4s lie directly above the topmost 12 row of your player.\n  - DOWN is ILLEGAL if any 4s lie directly below the bottommost 9 row of your player.\n* Always orient carefully before moving: check where the 15s lie (for UP), how far you are from the bottom-left indicator (for LEFT/RIGHT), and whether 4s precede/follow your 12s/9s in the intended direction.\n\n# GOAL\nFind/generate a key that MATCHES the key pattern shown at the EXIT, then navigate to the EXIT to finish the level.\nThere are 6 levels total. Complete all levels to WIN.\n\n# TILE MEANINGS (important ones)\n* 0 = white cell (used in key patterns)\n* 3 = walkable path / corridor marker (often outlines routes to key/exit)\n* 4 = WALL (solid). You cannot enter 4s.\n* 5 = EXIT indicator (presence of 5s marks/frames the exit area)\n* 8 = LIFE token (count lives as the number of 2×2 blocks of 8s)\n* 9 = blue cells (used in player lower body; also appear elsewhere in the map and in key logic)\n* 12 = orange cells (used in player upper body)\n* 15 = MOVE counter (number of 15s ≈ moves/energy left)\n\n# PLAYER (sprite + movement legality)\n* The player is an 8×8 sprite made ONLY of 12s (top two rows) over 9s (bottom six rows).\n  - Concretely: rows 0–1 (relative to the sprite) are all 12s; rows 2–7 are all 9s.\n  - Other scattered 9s on the board are NOT the player—only the exact 8×8 (2×8 of 12s stacked on 6×8 of 9s) is the player.\n* Movement rules:\n  - You may move only through non-4 cells (i.e., never overlap a 4 after a move).\n  - If any part of your 8×8 sprite would overlap a 4 in the target direction (including cases where 4s lie “under” 9s), that move is ILLEGAL.\n  - If your sprite is already touching 4s on a side, you cannot move further in that touching direction until you have clearance.\n  - Practically: navigate corridors “between the 4s”.\n\n# KEYS, EXIT, AND HOW TO FIND THEM\n* Bottom-left KEY INDICATOR (non-interactive):\n  - A small block of 0s and 9s COMPLETELY BOXED by 4s in the bottom-left of the entire grid.\n  - This is NOT reachable and NOT a gameplay area. It only shows your CURRENT selected key.\n* EXIT (the lock to open):\n  - Elsewhere on the map, the lock is the target 0/9 pattern you must match, adjacent to some 5s (the 5s need not fully surround it).\n  - You may leave the level only when your current key EXACTLY matches this lock’s 0/9 distribution.\n* KEY GENERATOR (interactive, how to generate keys):\n  - Look for a patch consisting of 0s and 9s that has a CLEAR path of 3s leading to it and around it, and is NOT bordered by 5s or boxed by 4s.\n  - When any part of your 8×8 player steps ONTO this patch, it GENERATES a NEW candidate key and updates the bottom-left indicator.\n  - Step OFF the patch and then back ON to generate yet another candidate key; repeat to cycle through the set of keys.\n  - Continue cycling until the bottom-left indicator EXACTLY matches the lock pattern at the exit (the same 0/9 layout adjacent to 5s).\n* Locating things quickly:\n  - Generator: 0/9 patch accessible via 3s, with only 3s around it (no 5s), is almost certainly the generator.\n  - Exit: a matching 0/9 pattern near 5s marks the lock/exit area.\n\n# HUD / PROGRESSION\n* Visual score on the second-to-last grid row (row 62): it contains several 4-cell “slots”.\n  - Slots made of 3s represent UNFINISHED levels.\n  - When a slot changes from 3s to another color, that level is COMPLETE.\n* Track remaining MOVES/ENERGY by counting tiles with value 15.\n* Track LIVES by counting distinct 2×2 blocks of 8s.\n\n# GENERAL NOTES\n* The grid is a bird’s-eye view.\n* If the grid does not change after an action, you likely attempted an illegal move into 4s.\n* Favor routes marked by 3s; use the generator (0/9 patch surrounded by 3s) to cycle keys; confirm the match by comparing the bottom-left indicator (boxed by 4s) to the 0/9 lock pattern found near 5s; then proceed to the exit.\n\n# EXAMPLE STRATEGY OBSERVATION\nThe 8×8 player (top rows 12s, bottom rows 9s) is touching 4s on the left, so LEFT is blocked. I see a 0/9 patch with only 3s around it to the right—that’s likely the generator. I should move RIGHT to step on/off it until the bottom-left indicator (boxed by 4s) matches the lock pattern I see near the 5s, then head to the exit.\n\n# TURN:\nCall exactly one action.\n\n"

    "content": "\n# CONTEXT:\nYou are an agent playing a dynamic game. Your objective is to\nWIN and avoid GAME_OVER while minimizing actions.\n\nOne action produces one Frame. One Frame is made of one or more sequential\nGrids. Each Grid is a matrix size INT<0,63> by INT<0,63> filled with\nINT<0,15> values. Each value represents a different color and usually implies a different object.\n\nYou are playing a game called LockSmith.\n\n# CONTROLS\n* RESET: start over\n* ACTION1: move up\n* ACTION2: move down\n* ACTION3: move left\n* ACTION4: move right\n* ACTION5/ACTION6: no-ops\n\n# ORIENTATION (read carefully)\n* The global frame is fixed: the bottom-left KEY INDICATOR is always at the bottom-left; the EXIT/lock is elsewhere.\n* ACTION1 (UP) moves you toward the area where 15s (move counters) are located; use this as a compass for “up.”\n* ACTION4 (RIGHT) increases your distance from the bottom-left key indicator; ACTION3 (LEFT) decreases it.\n* Legality checks with 4s (walls):\n  - RIGHT is ILLEGAL if any 4s lie immediately to the right (“after” in row order) of any 12/9 cells of your 8×8 player.\n  - LEFT is ILLEGAL if any 4s lie immediately to the left (“before” in row order) of any 12/9 cells of your 8×8 player.\n  - UP is ILLEGAL if any 4s lie directly above the topmost 12 row of your player.\n  - DOWN is ILLEGAL if any 4s lie directly below the bottommost 9 row of your player.\n* Always orient carefully before moving: check where the 15s lie (for UP), how far you are from the bottom-left indicator (for LEFT/RIGHT), and whether 4s precede/follow your 12s/9s in the intended direction.\n\n# GOAL\nFind/generate a key that MATCHES the key pattern shown at the EXIT, then navigate to the EXIT to finish the level.\nThere are 6 levels total. Complete all levels to WIN.\n\n# TILE MEANINGS (important ones)\n* 0 = white cell (used in key patterns)\n* 3 = walkable path / corridor marker (often outlines routes to key/exit)\n* 4 = WALL (solid). You cannot enter 4s.\n* 5 = EXIT indicator (presence of 5s marks/frames the exit area)\n* 8 = LIFE token (count lives as the number of 2×2 blocks of 8s)\n* 9 = blue cells (used in player lower body; also appear elsewhere in the map and in key logic)\n* 12 = orange cells (used in player upper body)\n* 15 = MOVE counter (number of 15s ≈ moves/energy left)\n\n# PLAYER (sprite + movement legality)\n* The player is an 8×8 sprite made ONLY of 12s (top two rows) over 9s (bottom six rows).\n  - Concretely: rows 0–1 (relative to the sprite) are all 12s; rows 2–7 are all 9s.\n  - Other scattered 9s on the board are NOT the player—only the exact 8×8 (2×8 of 12s stacked on 6×8 of 9s) is the player.\n* Movement rules:\n  - You may move only through non-4 cells (i.e., never overlap a 4 after a move).\n  - If any part of your 8×8 sprite would overlap a 4 in the target direction (including cases where 4s lie “under” 9s), that move is ILLEGAL.\n  - If your sprite is already touching 4s on a side, you cannot move further in that touching direction until you have clearance.\n  - Practically: navigate corridors “between the 4s”.\n\n# KEYS, EXIT, AND HOW TO FIND THEM\n* Bottom-left KEY INDICATOR (non-interactive):\n  - A small block of 0s and 9s COMPLETELY BOXED by 4s in the bottom-left of the entire grid.\n  - This is NOT reachable and NOT a gameplay area. It only shows your CURRENT selected key.\n* EXIT (the lock to open):\n  - Elsewhere on the map, the lock is the target 0/9 pattern you must match, adjacent to some 5s (the 5s need not fully surround it).\n  - You may leave the level only when your current key EXACTLY matches this lock’s 0/9 distribution.\n* KEY GENERATOR (interactive, how to generate keys):\n  - Look for a patch consisting of 0s and 9s that has a CLEAR path of 3s leading to it and around it, and is NOT bordered by 5s or boxed by 4s.\n  - When any part of your 8×8 player steps ONTO this patch, it GENERATES a NEW candidate key and updates the bottom-left indicator.\n  - Step OFF the patch and then back ON to generate yet another candidate key; repeat to cycle through the set of keys.\n  - Continue cycling until the bottom-left indicator EXACTLY matches the lock pattern at the exit (the same 0/9 layout adjacent to 5s).\n* Locating things quickly:\n  - Generator: 0/9 patch accessible via 3s, with only 3s around it (no 5s), is almost certainly the generator.\n  - Exit: a matching 0/9 pattern near 5s marks the lock/exit area.\n\n# HUD / PROGRESSION\n* Visual score on the second-to-last grid row (row 62): it contains several 4-cell “slots”.\n  - Slots made of 3s represent UNFINISHED levels.\n  - When a slot changes from 3s to another color, that level is COMPLETE.\n* Track remaining MOVES/ENERGY by counting tiles with value 15.\n* Track LIVES by counting distinct 2×2 blocks of 8s.\n\n# GENERAL NOTES\n* The grid is a bird’s-eye view.\n* If the grid does not change after an action, you likely attempted an illegal move into 4s.\n* Favor routes marked by 3s; use the generator (0/9 patch surrounded by 3s) to cycle keys; confirm the match by comparing the bottom-left indicator (boxed by 4s) to the 0/9 lock pattern found near 5s; then proceed to the exit.\n\n# EXAMPLE STRATEGY OBSERVATION\nThe 8×8 player (top rows 12s, bottom rows 9s) is touching 4s on the left, so LEFT is blocked. I see a 0/9 patch with only 3s around it to the right—that’s likely the generator. I should move RIGHT to step on/off it until the bottom-left indicator (boxed by 4s) matches the lock pattern I see near the 5s, then head to the exit.\n\n# TURN:\nCall exactly one action.\n\n"

    "content": "\n# CONTEXT:\nYou are an agent playing a dynamic game. Your objective is to\nWIN and avoid GAME_OVER while minimizing actions.\n\nOne action produces one Frame. One Frame is made of one or more sequential\nGrids. Each Grid is a matrix size INT<0,63> by INT<0,63> filled with\nINT<0,15> values. Each value represents a different color and usually implies a different object.\n\nYou are playing a game called LockSmith.\n\n# CONTROLS\n* RESET: start over\n* ACTION1: move up\n* ACTION2: move down\n* ACTION3: move left\n* ACTION4: move right\n* ACTION5/ACTION6: no-ops\n\n# ORIENTATION (read carefully)\n* The global frame is fixed: the bottom-left KEY INDICATOR is always at the bottom-left; the EXIT/lock is elsewhere.\n* ACTION1 (UP) moves you toward the area where 15s (move counters) are located; use this as a compass for “up.”\n* ACTION4 (RIGHT) increases your distance from the bottom-left key indicator; ACTION3 (LEFT) decreases it.\n* Legality checks with 4s (walls):\n  - RIGHT is ILLEGAL if any 4s lie immediately to the right (“after” in row order) of any 12/9 cells of your 8×8 player.\n  - LEFT is ILLEGAL if any 4s lie immediately to the left (“before” in row order) of any 12/9 cells of your 8×8 player.\n  - UP is ILLEGAL if any 4s lie directly above the topmost 12 row of your player.\n  - DOWN is ILLEGAL if any 4s lie directly below the bottommost 9 row of your player.\n* Always orient carefully before moving: check where the 15s lie (for UP), how far you are from the bottom-left indicator (for LEFT/RIGHT), and whether 4s precede/follow your 12s/9s in the intended direction.\n\n# GOAL\nFind/generate a key that MATCHES the key pattern shown at the EXIT, then navigate to the EXIT to finish the level.\nThere are 6 levels total. Complete all levels to WIN.\n\n# TILE MEANINGS (important ones)\n* 0 = white cell (used in key patterns)\n* 3 = walkable path / corridor marker (often outlines routes to key/exit)\n* 4 = WALL (solid). You cannot enter 4s.\n* 5 = EXIT indicator (presence of 5s marks/frames the exit area)\n* 8 = LIFE token (count lives as the number of 2×2 blocks of 8s)\n* 9 = blue cells (used in player lower body; also appear elsewhere in the map and in key logic)\n* 12 = orange cells (used in player upper body)\n* 15 = MOVE counter (number of 15s ≈ moves/energy left)\n\n# PLAYER (sprite + movement legality)\n* The player is an 8×8 sprite made ONLY of 12s (top two rows) over 9s (bottom six rows).\n  - Concretely: rows 0–1 (relative to the sprite) are all 12s; rows 2–7 are all 9s.\n  - Other scattered 9s on the board are NOT the player—only the exact 8×8 (2×8 of 12s stacked on 6×8 of 9s) is the player.\n* Movement rules:\n  - You may move only through non-4 cells (i.e., never overlap a 4 after a move).\n  - If any part of your 8×8 sprite would overlap a 4 in the target direction (including cases where 4s lie “under” 9s), that move is ILLEGAL.\n  - If your sprite is already touching 4s on a side, you cannot move further in that touching direction until you have clearance.\n  - Practically: navigate corridors “between the 4s”.\n\n# KEYS, EXIT, AND HOW TO FIND THEM\n* Bottom-left KEY INDICATOR (non-interactive):\n  - A small block of 0s and 9s COMPLETELY BOXED by 4s in the bottom-left of the entire grid.\n  - This is NOT reachable and NOT a gameplay area. It only shows your CURRENT selected key.\n* EXIT (the lock to open):\n  - Elsewhere on the map, the lock is the target 0/9 pattern you must match, adjacent to some 5s (the 5s need not fully surround it).\n  - You may leave the level only when your current key EXACTLY matches this lock’s 0/9 distribution.\n* KEY GENERATOR (interactive, how to generate keys):\n  - Look for a patch consisting of 0s and 9s that has a CLEAR path of 3s leading to it and around it, and is NOT bordered by 5s or boxed by 4s.\n  - When any part of your 8×8 player steps ONTO this patch, it GENERATES a NEW candidate key and updates the bottom-left indicator.\n  - Step OFF the patch and then back ON to generate yet another candidate key; repeat to cycle through the set of keys.\n  - Continue cycling until the bottom-left indicator EXACTLY matches the lock pattern at the exit (the same 0/9 layout adjacent to 5s).\n* Locating things quickly:\n  - Generator: 0/9 patch accessible via 3s, with only 3s around it (no 5s), is almost certainly the generator.\n  - Exit: a matching 0/9 pattern near 5s marks the lock/exit area.\n\n# HUD / PROGRESSION\n* Visual score on the second-to-last grid row (row 62): it contains several 4-cell “slots”.\n  - Slots made of 3s represent UNFINISHED levels.\n  - When a slot changes from 3s to another color, that level is COMPLETE.\n* Track remaining MOVES/ENERGY by counting tiles with value 15.\n* Track LIVES by counting distinct 2×2 blocks of 8s.\n\n# GENERAL NOTES\n* The grid is a bird’s-eye view.\n* If the grid does not change after an action, you likely attempted an illegal move into 4s.\n* Favor routes marked by 3s; use the generator (0/9 patch surrounded by 3s) to cycle keys; confirm the match by comparing the bottom-left indicator (boxed by 4s) to the 0/9 lock pattern found near 5s; then proceed to the exit.\n\n# EXAMPLE STRATEGY OBSERVATION\nThe 8×8 player (top rows 12s, bottom rows 9s) is touching 4s on the left, so LEFT is blocked. I see a 0/9 patch with only 3s around it to the right—that’s likely the generator. I should move RIGHT to step on/off it until the bottom-left indicator (boxed by 4s) matches the lock pattern I see near the 5s, then head to the exit.\n\n# TURN:\nCall exactly one action.\n\n"

    "content": "\n# CONTEXT:\nYou are an agent playing a dynamic game. Your objective is to\nWIN and avoid GAME_OVER while minimizing actions.\n\nOne action produces one Frame. One Frame is made of one or more sequential\nGrids. Each Grid is a matrix size INT<0,63> by INT<0,63> filled with\nINT<0,15> values. Each value represents a different color and usually implies a different object.\n\nYou are playing a game called LockSmith.\n\n# CONTROLS\n* RESET: start over\n* ACTION1: move up\n* ACTION2: move down\n* ACTION3: move left\n* ACTION4: move right\n* ACTION5/ACTION6: no-ops\n\n# ORIENTATION (read carefully)\n* The global frame is fixed: the bottom-left KEY INDICATOR is always at the bottom-left; the EXIT/lock is elsewhere.\n* ACTION1 (UP) moves you toward the area where 15s (move counters) are located; use this as a compass for “up.”\n* ACTION4 (RIGHT) increases your distance from the bottom-left key indicator; ACTION3 (LEFT) decreases it.\n* Legality checks with 4s (walls):\n  - RIGHT is ILLEGAL if any 4s lie immediately to the right (“after” in row order) of any 12/9 cells of your 8×8 player.\n  - LEFT is ILLEGAL if any 4s lie immediately to the left (“before” in row order) of any 12/9 cells of your 8×8 player.\n  - UP is ILLEGAL if any 4s lie directly above the topmost 12 row of your player.\n  - DOWN is ILLEGAL if any 4s lie directly below the bottommost 9 row of your player.\n* Always orient carefully before moving: check where the 15s lie (for UP), how far you are from the bottom-left indicator (for LEFT/RIGHT), and whether 4s precede/follow your 12s/9s in the intended direction.\n\n# GOAL\nFind/generate a key that MATCHES the key pattern shown at the EXIT, then navigate to the EXIT to finish the level.\nThere are 6 levels total. Complete all levels to WIN.\n\n# TILE MEANINGS (important ones)\n* 0 = white cell (used in key patterns)\n* 3 = walkable path / corridor marker (often outlines routes to key/exit)\n* 4 = WALL (solid). You cannot enter 4s.\n* 5 = EXIT indicator (presence of 5s marks/frames the exit area)\n* 8 = LIFE token (count lives as the number of 2×2 blocks of 8s)\n* 9 = blue cells (used in player lower body; also appear elsewhere in the map and in key logic)\n* 12 = orange cells (used in player upper body)\n* 15 = MOVE counter (number of 15s ≈ moves/energy left)\n\n# PLAYER (sprite + movement legality)\n* The player is an 8×8 sprite made ONLY of 12s (top two rows) over 9s (bottom six rows).\n  - Concretely: rows 0–1 (relative to the sprite) are all 12s; rows 2–7 are all 9s.\n  - Other scattered 9s on the board are NOT the player—only the exact 8×8 (2×8 of 12s stacked on 6×8 of 9s) is the player.\n* Movement rules:\n  - You may move only through non-4 cells (i.e., never overlap a 4 after a move).\n  - If any part of your 8×8 sprite would overlap a 4 in the target direction (including cases where 4s lie “under” 9s), that move is ILLEGAL.\n  - If your sprite is already touching 4s on a side, you cannot move further in that touching direction until you have clearance.\n  - Practically: navigate corridors “between the 4s”.\n\n# KEYS, EXIT, AND HOW TO FIND THEM\n* Bottom-left KEY INDICATOR (non-interactive):\n  - A small block of 0s and 9s COMPLETELY BOXED by 4s in the bottom-left of the entire grid.\n  - This is NOT reachable and NOT a gameplay area. It only shows your CURRENT selected key.\n* EXIT (the lock to open):\n  - Elsewhere on the map, the lock is the target 0/9 pattern you must match, adjacent to some 5s (the 5s need not fully surround it).\n  - You may leave the level only when your current key EXACTLY matches this lock’s 0/9 distribution.\n* KEY GENERATOR (interactive, how to generate keys):\n  - Look for a patch consisting of 0s and 9s that has a CLEAR path of 3s leading to it and around it, and is NOT bordered by 5s or boxed by 4s.\n  - When any part of your 8×8 player steps ONTO this patch, it GENERATES a NEW candidate key and updates the bottom-left indicator.\n  - Step OFF the patch and then back ON to generate yet another candidate key; repeat to cycle through the set of keys.\n  - Continue cycling until the bottom-left indicator EXACTLY matches the lock pattern at the exit (the same 0/9 layout adjacent to 5s).\n* Locating things quickly:\n  - Generator: 0/9 patch accessible via 3s, with only 3s around it (no 5s), is almost certainly the generator.\n  - Exit: a matching 0/9 pattern near 5s marks the lock/exit area.\n\n# HUD / PROGRESSION\n* Visual score on the second-to-last grid row (row 62): it contains several 4-cell “slots”.\n  - Slots made of 3s represent UNFINISHED levels.\n  - When a slot changes from 3s to another color, that level is COMPLETE.\n* Track remaining MOVES/ENERGY by counting tiles with value 15.\n* Track LIVES by counting distinct 2×2 blocks of 8s.\n\n# GENERAL NOTES\n* The grid is a bird’s-eye view.\n* If the grid does not change after an action, you likely attempted an illegal move into 4s.\n* Favor routes marked by 3s; use the generator (0/9 patch surrounded by 3s) to cycle keys; confirm the match by comparing the bottom-left indicator (boxed by 4s) to the 0/9 lock pattern found near 5s; then proceed to the exit.\n\n# EXAMPLE STRATEGY OBSERVATION\nThe 8×8 player (top rows 12s, bottom rows 9s) is touching 4s on the left, so LEFT is blocked. I see a 0/9 patch with only 3s around it to the right—that’s likely the generator. I should move RIGHT to step on/off it until the bottom-left indicator (boxed by 4s) matches the lock pattern I see near the 5s, then head to the exit.\n\n# TURN:\nCall exactly one action.\n\n"

    "content": "\n# CONTEXT:\nYou are an agent playing a dynamic game. Your objective is to\nWIN and avoid GAME_OVER while minimizing actions.\n\nOne action produces one Frame. One Frame is made of one or more sequential\nGrids. Each Grid is a matrix size INT<0,63> by INT<0,63> filled with\nINT<0,15> values. Each value represents a different color and usually implies a different object.\n\nYou are playing a game called LockSmith.\n\n# CONTROLS\n* RESET: start over\n* ACTION1: move up\n* ACTION2: move down\n* ACTION3: move left\n* ACTION4: move right\n* ACTION5/ACTION6: no-ops\n\n# ORIENTATION (read carefully)\n* The global frame is fixed: the bottom-left KEY INDICATOR is always at the bottom-left; the EXIT/lock is elsewhere.\n* ACTION1 (UP) moves you toward the area where 15s (move counters) are located; use this as a compass for “up.”\n* ACTION4 (RIGHT) increases your distance from the bottom-left key indicator; ACTION3 (LEFT) decreases it.\n* Legality checks with 4s (walls):\n  - RIGHT is ILLEGAL if any 4s lie immediately to the right (“after” in row order) of any 12/9 cells of your 8×8 player.\n  - LEFT is ILLEGAL if any 4s lie immediately to the left (“before” in row order) of any 12/9 cells of your 8×8 player.\n  - UP is ILLEGAL if any 4s lie directly above the topmost 12 row of your player.\n  - DOWN is ILLEGAL if any 4s lie directly below the bottommost 9 row of your player.\n* Always orient carefully before moving: check where the 15s lie (for UP), how far you are from the bottom-left indicator (for LEFT/RIGHT), and whether 4s precede/follow your 12s/9s in the intended direction.\n\n# GOAL\nFind/generate a key that MATCHES the key pattern shown at the EXIT, then navigate to the EXIT to finish the level.\nThere are 6 levels total. Complete all levels to WIN.\n\n# TILE MEANINGS (important ones)\n* 0 = white cell (used in key patterns)\n* 3 = walkable path / corridor marker (often outlines routes to key/exit)\n* 4 = WALL (solid). You cannot enter 4s.\n* 5 = EXIT indicator (presence of 5s marks/frames the exit area)\n* 8 = LIFE token (count lives as the number of 2×2 blocks of 8s)\n* 9 = blue cells (used in player lower body; also appear elsewhere in the map and in key logic)\n* 12 = orange cells (used in player upper body)\n* 15 = MOVE counter (number of 15s ≈ moves/energy left)\n\n# PLAYER (sprite + movement legality)\n* The player is an 8×8 sprite made ONLY of 12s (top two rows) over 9s (bottom six rows).\n  - Concretely: rows 0–1 (relative to the sprite) are all 12s; rows 2–7 are all 9s.\n  - Other scattered 9s on the board are NOT the player—only the exact 8×8 (2×8 of 12s stacked on 6×8 of 9s) is the player.\n* Movement rules:\n  - You may move only through non-4 cells (i.e., never overlap a 4 after a move).\n  - If any part of your 8×8 sprite would overlap a 4 in the target direction (including cases where 4s lie “under” 9s), that move is ILLEGAL.\n  - If your sprite is already touching 4s on a side, you cannot move further in that touching direction until you have clearance.\n  - Practically: navigate corridors “between the 4s”.\n\n# KEYS, EXIT, AND HOW TO FIND THEM\n* Bottom-left KEY INDICATOR (non-interactive):\n  - A small block of 0s and 9s COMPLETELY BOXED by 4s in the bottom-left of the entire grid.\n  - This is NOT reachable and NOT a gameplay area. It only shows your CURRENT selected key.\n* EXIT (the lock to open):\n  - Elsewhere on the map, the lock is the target 0/9 pattern you must match, adjacent to some 5s (the 5s need not fully surround it).\n  - You may leave the level only when your current key EXACTLY matches this lock’s 0/9 distribution.\n* KEY GENERATOR (interactive, how to generate keys):\n  - Look for a patch consisting of 0s and 9s that has a CLEAR path of 3s leading to it and around it, and is NOT bordered by 5s or boxed by 4s.\n  - When any part of your 8×8 player steps ONTO this patch, it GENERATES a NEW candidate key and updates the bottom-left indicator.\n  - Step OFF the patch and then back ON to generate yet another candidate key; repeat to cycle through the set of keys.\n  - Continue cycling until the bottom-left indicator EXACTLY matches the lock pattern at the exit (the same 0/9 layout adjacent to 5s).\n* Locating things quickly:\n  - Generator: 0/9 patch accessible via 3s, with only 3s around it (no 5s), is almost certainly the generator.\n  - Exit: a matching 0/9 pattern near 5s marks the lock/exit area.\n\n# HUD / PROGRESSION\n* Visual score on the second-to-last grid row (row 62): it contains several 4-cell “slots”.\n  - Slots made of 3s represent UNFINISHED levels.\n  - When a slot changes from 3s to another color, that level is COMPLETE.\n* Track remaining MOVES/ENERGY by counting tiles with value 15.\n* Track LIVES by counting distinct 2×2 blocks of 8s.\n\n# GENERAL NOTES\n* The grid is a bird’s-eye view.\n* If the grid does not change after an action, you likely attempted an illegal move into 4s.\n* Favor routes marked by 3s; use the generator (0/9 patch surrounded by 3s) to cycle keys; confirm the match by comparing the bottom-left indicator (boxed by 4s) to the 0/9 lock pattern found near 5s; then proceed to the exit.\n\n# EXAMPLE STRATEGY OBSERVATION\nThe 8×8 player (top rows 12s, bottom rows 9s) is touching 4s on the left, so LEFT is blocked. I see a 0/9 patch with only 3s around it to the right—that’s likely the generator. I should move RIGHT to step on/off it until the bottom-left indicator (boxed by 4s) matches the lock pattern I see near the 5s, then head to the exit.\n\n# TURN:\nCall exactly one action.\n\n"

    "content": "\n# CONTEXT:\nYou are an agent playing a dynamic game. Your objective is to\nWIN and avoid GAME_OVER while minimizing actions.\n\nOne action produces one Frame. One Frame is made of one or more sequential\nGrids. Each Grid is a matrix size INT<0,63> by INT<0,63> filled with\nINT<0,15> values. Each value represents a different color and usually implies a different object.\n\nYou are playing a game called LockSmith.\n\n# CONTROLS\n* RESET: start over\n* ACTION1: move up\n* ACTION2: move down\n* ACTION3: move left\n* ACTION4: move right\n* ACTION5/ACTION6: no-ops\n\n# ORIENTATION (read carefully)\n* The global frame is fixed: the bottom-left KEY INDICATOR is always at the bottom-left; the EXIT/lock is elsewhere.\n* ACTION1 (UP) moves you toward the area where 15s (move counters) are located; use this as a compass for “up.”\n* ACTION4 (RIGHT) increases your distance from the bottom-left key indicator; ACTION3 (LEFT) decreases it.\n* Legality checks with 4s (walls):\n  - RIGHT is ILLEGAL if any 4s lie immediately to the right (“after” in row order) of any 12/9 cells of your 8×8 player.\n  - LEFT is ILLEGAL if any 4s lie immediately to the left (“before” in row order) of any 12/9 cells of your 8×8 player.\n  - UP is ILLEGAL if any 4s lie directly above the topmost 12 row of your player.\n  - DOWN is ILLEGAL if any 4s lie directly below the bottommost 9 row of your player.\n* Always orient carefully before moving: check where the 15s lie (for UP), how far you are from the bottom-left indicator (for LEFT/RIGHT), and whether 4s precede/follow your 12s/9s in the intended direction.\n\n# GOAL\nFind/generate a key that MATCHES the key pattern shown at the EXIT, then navigate to the EXIT to finish the level.\nThere are 6 levels total. Complete all levels to WIN.\n\n# TILE MEANINGS (important ones)\n* 0 = white cell (used in key patterns)\n* 3 = walkable path / corridor marker (often outlines routes to key/exit)\n* 4 = WALL (solid). You cannot enter 4s.\n* 5 = EXIT indicator (presence of 5s marks/frames the exit area)\n* 8 = LIFE token (count lives as the number of 2×2 blocks of 8s)\n* 9 = blue cells (used in player lower body; also appear elsewhere in the map and in key logic)\n* 12 = orange cells (used in player upper body)\n* 15 = MOVE counter (number of 15s ≈ moves/energy left)\n\n# PLAYER (sprite + movement legality)\n* The player is an 8×8 sprite made ONLY of 12s (top two rows) over 9s (bottom six rows).\n  - Concretely: rows 0–1 (relative to the sprite) are all 12s; rows 2–7 are all 9s.\n  - Other scattered 9s on the board are NOT the player—only the exact 8×8 (2×8 of 12s stacked on 6×8 of 9s) is the player.\n* Movement rules:\n  - You may move only through non-4 cells (i.e., never overlap a 4 after a move).\n  - If any part of your 8×8 sprite would overlap a 4 in the target direction (including cases where 4s lie “under” 9s), that move is ILLEGAL.\n  - If your sprite is already touching 4s on a side, you cannot move further in that touching direction until you have clearance.\n  - Practically: navigate corridors “between the 4s”.\n\n# KEYS, EXIT, AND HOW TO FIND THEM\n* Bottom-left KEY INDICATOR (non-interactive):\n  - A small block of 0s and 9s COMPLETELY BOXED by 4s in the bottom-left of the entire grid.\n  - This is NOT reachable and NOT a gameplay area. It only shows your CURRENT selected key.\n* EXIT (the lock to open):\n  - Elsewhere on the map, the lock is the target 0/9 pattern you must match, adjacent to some 5s (the 5s need not fully surround it).\n  - You may leave the level only when your current key EXACTLY matches this lock’s 0/9 distribution.\n* KEY GENERATOR (interactive, how to generate keys):\n  - Look for a patch consisting of 0s and 9s that has a CLEAR path of 3s leading to it and around it, and is NOT bordered by 5s or boxed by 4s.\n  - When any part of your 8×8 player steps ONTO this patch, it GENERATES a NEW candidate key and updates the bottom-left indicator.\n  - Step OFF the patch and then back ON to generate yet another candidate key; repeat to cycle through the set of keys.\n  - Continue cycling until the bottom-left indicator EXACTLY matches the lock pattern at the exit (the same 0/9 layout adjacent to 5s).\n* Locating things quickly:\n  - Generator: 0/9 patch accessible via 3s, with only 3s around it (no 5s), is almost certainly the generator.\n  - Exit: a matching 0/9 pattern near 5s marks the lock/exit area.\n\n# HUD / PROGRESSION\n* Visual score on the second-to-last grid row (row 62): it contains several 4-cell “slots”.\n  - Slots made of 3s represent UNFINISHED levels.\n  - When a slot changes from 3s to another color, that level is COMPLETE.\n* Track remaining MOVES/ENERGY by counting tiles with value 15.\n* Track LIVES by counting distinct 2×2 blocks of 8s.\n\n# GENERAL NOTES\n* The grid is a bird’s-eye view.\n* If the grid does not change after an action, you likely attempted an illegal move into 4s.\n* Favor routes marked by 3s; use the generator (0/9 patch surrounded by 3s) to cycle keys; confirm the match by comparing the bottom-left indicator (boxed by 4s) to the 0/9 lock pattern found near 5s; then proceed to the exit.\n\n# EXAMPLE STRATEGY OBSERVATION\nThe 8×8 player (top rows 12s, bottom rows 9s) is touching 4s on the left, so LEFT is blocked. I see a 0/9 patch with only 3s around it to the right—that’s likely the generator. I should move RIGHT to step on/off it until the bottom-left indicator (boxed by 4s) matches the lock pattern I see near the 5s, then head to the exit.\n\n# TURN:\nCall exactly one action.\n\n"

Each value represents a different color and usually implies a different object.\n\nYou are playing a game called LockSmith.\n\n# CONTROLS\n* RESET: start over\n* ACTION1: move up\n* ACTION2: move down\n* ACTION3: move left\n* ACTION4: move right\n* ACTION5/ACTION6: no-ops\n\n# ORIENTATION (read carefully)\n* The global frame is fixed: the bottom-left KEY INDICATOR is always at the bottom-left; the EXIT/lock is elsewhere.\n* ACTION1 (UP) moves you toward the area where 15s (move counters) are located; use this as a compass for “up.”\n* ACTION4 (RIGHT) increases your distance from the bottom-left key indicator; ACTION3 (LEFT) decreases it.\n* Legality checks with 4s (walls):\n  - RIGHT is ILLEGAL if any 4s lie immediately to the right (“after” in row order) of any 12/9 cells of your 8×8 player.\n  - LEFT is ILLEGAL if any 4s lie immediately to the left (“before” in row order) of any 12/9 cells of your 8×8 player.\n  - UP is ILLEGAL if any 4s lie directly above the topmost 12 row of your player.\n  - DOWN is ILLEGAL if any 4s lie directly below the bottommost 9 row of your player.\n* Always orient carefully before moving: check where the 15s lie (for UP), how far you are from the bottom-left indicator (for LEFT/RIGHT), and whether 4s precede/follow your 12s/9s in the intended direction.\n\n# GOAL\nFind/generate a key that MATCHES the key pattern shown at the EXIT, then navigate to the EXIT to finish the level.\nThere are 6 levels total. Complete all levels to WIN.\n\n# TILE MEANINGS (important ones)\n* 0 = white cell (used in key patterns)\n* 3 = walkable path / corridor marker (often outlines routes to key/exit)\n* 4 = WALL (solid). You cannot enter 4s.\n* 5 = EXIT indicator (presence of 5s marks/frames the exit area)\n* 8 = LIFE token (count lives as the number of 2×2 blocks of 8s)\n* 9 = blue cells (used in player lower body; also appear elsewhere in the map and in key logic)\n* 12 = orange cells (used in player upper body)\n* 15 = MOVE counter (number of 15s ≈ moves/energy left)\n\n# PLAYER (sprite + movement legality)\n* The player is an 8×8 sprite made ONLY of 12s (top two rows) over 9s (bottom six rows).\n  - Concretely: rows 0–1 (relative to the sprite) are all 12s; rows 2–7 are all 9s.\n  - Other scattered 9s on the board are NOT the player—only the exact 8×8 (2×8 of 12s stacked on 6×8 of 9s) is the player.\n* Movement rules:\n  - You may move only through non-4 cells (i.e., never overlap a 4 after a move).\n  - If any part of your 8×8 sprite would overlap a 4 in the target direction (including cases where 4s lie “under” 9s), that move is ILLEGAL.\n  - If your sprite is already touching 4s on a side, you cannot move further in that touching direction until you have clearance.\n  - Practically: navigate corridors “between the 4s”.\n\n# KEYS, EXIT, AND HOW TO FIND THEM\n* Bottom-left KEY INDICATOR (non-interactive):\n  - A small block of 0s and 9s COMPLETELY BOXED by 4s in the bottom-left of the entire grid.\n  - This is NOT reachable and NOT a gameplay area. It only shows your CURRENT selected key.\n* EXIT (the lock to open):\n  - Elsewhere on the map, the lock is the target 0/9 pattern you must match, adjacent to some 5s (the 5s need not fully surround it).\n  - You may leave the level only when your current key EXACTLY matches this lock’s 0/9 distribution.\n* KEY GENERATOR (interactive, how to generate keys):\n  - Look for a patch consisting of 0s and 9s that has a CLEAR path of 3s leading to it and around it, and is NOT bordered by 5s or boxed by 4s.\n  - When any part of your 8×8 player steps ONTO this patch, it GENERATES a NEW candidate key and updates the bottom-left indicator.\n  - Step OFF the patch and then back ON to generate yet another candidate key; repeat to cycle through the set of keys.\n  - Continue cycling until the bottom-left indicator EXACTLY matches the lock pattern at the exit (the same 0/9 layout adjacent to 5s).\n* Locating things quickly:\n  - Generator: 0/9 patch accessible via 3s, with only 3s around it (no 5s), is almost certainly the generator.\n  - Exit: a matching 0/9 pattern near 5s marks the lock/exit area.\n\n# HUD / PROGRESSION\n* Visual score on the second-to-last grid row (row 62): it contains several 4-cell “slots”.\n  - Slots made of 3s represent UNFINISHED levels.\n  - When a slot changes from 3s to another color, that level is COMPLETE.\n* Track remaining MOVES/ENERGY by counting tiles with value 15.\n* Track LIVES by counting distinct 2×2 blocks of 8s.\n\n# GENERAL NOTES\n* The grid is a bird’s-eye view.\n* If the grid does not change after an action, you likely attempted an illegal move into 4s.\n* Favor routes marked by 3s; use the generator (0/9 patch surrounded by 3s) to cycle keys; confirm the match by comparing the bottom-left indicator (boxed by 4s) to the 0/9 lock pattern found near 5s; then proceed to the exit.\n\n# EXAMPLE STRATEGY OBSERVATION\nThe 8×8 player (top rows 12s, bottom rows 9s) is touching 4s on the left, so LEFT is blocked. I see a 0/9 patch with only 3s around it to the right—that’s likely the generator. I should move RIGHT to step on/off it until the bottom-left indicator (boxed by 4s) matches the lock pattern I see near the 5s, then head to the exit.\n\n# TURN:\nCall exactly one action.\n\n"

    "content": "\n# CONTEXT:\nYou are an agent playing a dynamic game. Your objective is to\nWIN and avoid GAME_OVER while minimizing actions.\n\nOne action produces one Frame. One Frame is made of one or more sequential\nGrids. Each Grid is a matrix size INT<0,63> by INT<0,63> filled with\nINT<0,15> values. Each value represents a different color and usually implies a different object.\n\nYou are playing a game called LockSmith.\n\n# CONTROLS\n* RESET: start over\n* ACTION1: move up\n* ACTION2: move down\n* ACTION3: move left\n* ACTION4: move right\n* ACTION5/ACTION6: no-ops\n\n# ORIENTATION (read carefully)\n* The global frame is fixed: the bottom-left KEY INDICATOR is always at the bottom-left; the EXIT/lock is elsewhere.\n* ACTION1 (UP) moves you toward the area where 15s (move counters) are located; use this as a compass for “up.”\n* ACTION4 (RIGHT) increases your distance from the bottom-left key indicator; ACTION3 (LEFT) decreases it.\n* Legality checks with 4s (walls):\n  - RIGHT is ILLEGAL if any 4s lie immediately to the right (“after” in row order) of any 12/9 cells of your 8×8 player.\n  - LEFT is ILLEGAL if any 4s lie immediately to the left (“before” in row order) of any 12/9 cells of your 8×8 player.\n  - UP is ILLEGAL if any 4s lie directly above the topmost 12 row of your player.\n  - DOWN is ILLEGAL if any 4s lie directly below the bottommost 9 row of your player.\n* Always orient carefully before moving: check where the 15s lie (for UP), how far you are from the bottom-left indicator (for LEFT/RIGHT), and whether 4s precede/follow your 12s/9s in the intended direction.\n\n# GOAL\nFind/generate a key that MATCHES the key pattern shown at the EXIT, then navigate to the EXIT to finish the level.\nThere are 6 levels total. Complete all levels to WIN.\n\n# TILE MEANINGS (important ones)\n* 0 = white cell (used in key patterns)\n* 3 = walkable path / corridor marker (often outlines routes to key/exit)\n* 4 = WALL (solid). You cannot enter 4s.\n* 5 = EXIT indicator (presence of 5s marks/frames the exit area)\n* 8 = LIFE token (count lives as the number of 2×2 blocks of 8s)\n* 9 = blue cells (used in player lower body; also appear elsewhere in the map and in key logic)\n* 12 = orange cells (used in player upper body)\n* 15 = MOVE counter (number of 15s ≈ moves/energy left)\n\n# PLAYER (sprite + movement legality)\n* The player is an 8×8 sprite made ONLY of 12s (top two rows) over 9s (bottom six rows).\n  - Concretely: rows 0–1 (relative to the sprite) are all 12s; rows 2–7 are all 9s.\n  - Other scattered 9s on the board are NOT the player—only the exact 8×8 (2×8 of 12s stacked on 6×8 of 9s) is the player.\n* Movement rules:\n  - You may move only through non-4 cells (i.e., never overlap a 4 after a move).\n  - If any part of your 8×8 sprite would overlap a 4 in the target direction (including cases where 4s lie “under” 9s), that move is ILLEGAL.\n  - If your sprite is already touching 4s on a side, you cannot move further in that touching direction until you have clearance.\n  - Practically: navigate corridors “between the 4s”.\n\n# KEYS, EXIT, AND HOW TO FIND THEM\n* Bottom-left KEY INDICATOR (non-interactive):\n  - A small block of 0s and 9s COMPLETELY BOXED by 4s in the bottom-left of the entire grid.\n  - This is NOT reachable and NOT a gameplay area. It only shows your CURRENT selected key.\n* EXIT (the lock to open):\n  - Elsewhere on the map, the lock is the target 0/9 pattern you must match, adjacent to some 5s (the 5s need not fully surround it).\n  - You may leave the level only when your current key EXACTLY matches this lock’s 0/9 distribution.\n* KEY GENERATOR (interactive, how to generate keys):\n  - Look for a patch consisting of 0s and 9s that has a CLEAR path of 3s leading to it and around it, and is NOT bordered by 5s or boxed by 4s.\n  - When any part of your 8×8 player steps ONTO this patch, it GENERATES a NEW candidate key and updates the bottom-left indicator.\n  - Step OFF the patch and then back ON to generate yet another candidate key; repeat to cycle through the set of keys.\n  - Continue cycling until the bottom-left indicator EXACTLY matches the lock pattern at the exit (the same 0/9 layout adjacent to 5s).\n* Locating things quickly:\n  - Generator: 0/9 patch accessible via 3s, with only 3s around it (no 5s), is almost certainly the generator.\n  - Exit: a matching 0/9 pattern near 5s marks the lock/exit area.\n\n# HUD / PROGRESSION\n* Visual score on the second-to-last grid row (row 62): it contains several 4-cell “slots”.\n  - Slots made of 3s represent UNFINISHED levels.\n  - When a slot changes from 3s to another color, that level is COMPLETE.\n* Track remaining MOVES/ENERGY by counting tiles with value 15.\n* Track LIVES by counting distinct 2×2 blocks of 8s.\n\n# GENERAL NOTES\n* The grid is a bird’s-eye view.\n* If the grid does not change after an action, you likely attempted an illegal move into 4s.\n* Favor routes marked by 3s; use the generator (0/9 patch surrounded by 3s) to cycle keys; confirm the match by comparing the bottom-left indicator (boxed by 4s) to the 0/9 lock pattern found near 5s; then proceed to the exit.\n\n# EXAMPLE STRATEGY OBSERVATION\nThe 8×8 player (top rows 12s, bottom rows 9s) is touching 4s on the left, so LEFT is blocked. I see a 0/9 patch with only 3s around it to the right—that’s likely the generator. I should move RIGHT to step on/off it until the bottom-left indicator (boxed by 4s) matches the lock pattern I see near the 5s, then head to the exit.\n\n# TURN:\nCall exactly one action.\n\n"

One Frame is made of one or more sequential\nGrids. Each Grid is a matrix size INT<0,63> by INT<0,63> filled with\nINT<0,15> values. Each value represents a different color and usually implies a different object.\n\nYou are playing a game called LockSmith.\n\n# CONTROLS\n* RESET: start over\n* ACTION1: move up\n* ACTION2: move down\n* ACTION3: move left\n* ACTION4: move right\n* ACTION5/ACTION6: no-ops\n\n# ORIENTATION (read carefully)\n* The global frame is fixed: the bottom-left KEY INDICATOR is always at the bottom-left; the EXIT/lock is elsewhere.\n* ACTION1 (UP) moves you toward the area where 15s (move counters) are located; use this as a compass for “up.”\n* ACTION4 (RIGHT) increases your distance from the bottom-left key indicator; ACTION3 (LEFT) decreases it.\n* Legality checks with 4s (walls):\n  - RIGHT is ILLEGAL if any 4s lie immediately to the right (“after” in row order) of any 12/9 cells of your 8×8 player.\n  - LEFT is ILLEGAL if any 4s lie immediately to the left (“before” in row order) of any 12/9 cells of your 8×8 player.\n  - UP is ILLEGAL if any 4s lie directly above the topmost 12 row of your player.\n  - DOWN is ILLEGAL if any 4s lie directly below the bottommost 9 row of your player.\n* Always orient carefully before moving: check where the 15s lie (for UP), how far you are from the bottom-left indicator (for LEFT/RIGHT), and whether 4s precede/follow your 12s/9s in the intended direction.\n\n# GOAL\nFind/generate a key that MATCHES the key pattern shown at the EXIT, then navigate to the EXIT to finish the level.\nThere are 6 levels total. Complete all levels to WIN.\n\n# TILE MEANINGS (important ones)\n* 0 = white cell (used in key patterns)\n* 3 = walkable path / corridor marker (often outlines routes to key/exit)\n* 4 = WALL (solid). You cannot enter 4s.\n* 5 = EXIT indicator (presence of 5s marks/frames the exit area)\n* 8 = LIFE token (count lives as the number of 2×2 blocks of 8s)\n* 9 = blue cells (used in player lower body; also appear elsewhere in the map and in key logic)\n* 12 = orange cells (used in player upper body)\n* 15 = MOVE counter (number of 15s ≈ moves/energy left)\n\n# PLAYER (sprite + movement legality)\n* The player is an 8×8 sprite made ONLY of 12s (top two rows) over 9s (bottom six rows).\n  - Concretely: rows 0–1 (relative to the sprite) are all 12s; rows 2–7 are all 9s.\n  - Other scattered 9s on the board are NOT the player—only the exact 8×8 (2×8 of 12s stacked on 6×8 of 9s) is the player.\n* Movement rules:\n  - You may move only through non-4 cells (i.e., never overlap a 4 after a move).\n  - If any part of your 8×8 sprite would overlap a 4 in the target direction (including cases where 4s lie “under” 9s), that move is ILLEGAL.\n  - If your sprite is already touching 4s on a side, you cannot move further in that touching direction until you have clearance.\n  - Practically: navigate corridors “between the 4s”.\n\n# KEYS, EXIT, AND HOW TO FIND THEM\n* Bottom-left KEY INDICATOR (non-interactive):\n  - A small block of 0s and 9s COMPLETELY BOXED by 4s in the bottom-left of the entire grid.\n  - This is NOT reachable and NOT a gameplay area. It only shows your CURRENT selected key.\n* EXIT (the lock to open):\n  - Elsewhere on the map, the lock is the target 0/9 pattern you must match, adjacent to some 5s (the 5s need not fully surround it).\n  - You may leave the level only when your current key EXACTLY matches this lock’s 0/9 distribution.\n* KEY GENERATOR (interactive, how to generate keys):\n  - Look for a patch consisting of 0s and 9s that has a CLEAR path of 3s leading to it and around it, and is NOT bordered by 5s or boxed by 4s.\n  - When any part of your 8×8 player steps ONTO this patch, it GENERATES a NEW candidate key and updates the bottom-left indicator.\n  - Step OFF the patch and then back ON to generate yet another candidate key; repeat to cycle through the set of keys.\n  - Continue cycling until the bottom-left indicator EXACTLY matches the lock pattern at the exit (the same 0/9 layout adjacent to 5s).\n* Locating things quickly:\n  - Generator: 0/9 patch accessible via 3s, with only 3s around it (no 5s), is almost certainly the generator.\n  - Exit: a matching 0/9 pattern near 5s marks the lock/exit area.\n\n# HUD / PROGRESSION\n* Visual score on the second-to-last grid row (row 62): it contains several 4-cell “slots”.\n  - Slots made of 3s represent UNFINISHED levels.\n  - When a slot changes from 3s to another color, that level is COMPLETE.\n* Track remaining MOVES/ENERGY by counting tiles with value 15.\n* Track LIVES by counting distinct 2×2 blocks of 8s.\n\n# GENERAL NOTES\n* The grid is a bird’s-eye view.\n* If the grid does not change after an action, you likely attempted an illegal move into 4s.\n* Favor routes marked by 3s; use the generator (0/9 patch surrounded by 3s) to cycle keys; confirm the match by comparing the bottom-left indicator (boxed by 4s) to the 0/9 lock pattern found near 5s; then proceed to the exit.\n\n# EXAMPLE STRATEGY OBSERVATION\nThe 8×8 player (top rows 12s, bottom rows 9s) is touching 4s on the left, so LEFT is blocked. I see a 0/9 patch with only 3s around it to the right—that’s likely the generator. I should move RIGHT to step on/off it until the bottom-left indicator (boxed by 4s) matches the lock pattern I see near the 5s, then head to the exit.\n\n# TURN:\nCall exactly one action.\n\n"

    "content": "\n# CONTEXT:\nYou are an agent playing a dynamic game. Your objective is to\nWIN and avoid GAME_OVER while minimizing actions.\n\nOne action produces one Frame. One Frame is made of one or more sequential\nGrids. Each Grid is a matrix size INT<0,63> by INT<0,63> filled with\nINT<0,15> values. Each value represents a different color and usually implies a different object.\n\nYou are playing a game called LockSmith.\n\n# CONTROLS\n* RESET: start over\n* ACTION1: move up\n* ACTION2: move down\n* ACTION3: move left\n* ACTION4: move right\n* ACTION5/ACTION6: no-ops\n\n# ORIENTATION (read carefully)\n* The global frame is fixed: the bottom-left KEY INDICATOR is always at the bottom-left; the EXIT/lock is elsewhere.\n* ACTION1 (UP) moves you toward the area where 15s (move counters) are located; use this as a compass for “up.”\n* ACTION4 (RIGHT) increases your distance from the bottom-left key indicator; ACTION3 (LEFT) decreases it.\n* Legality checks with 4s (walls):\n  - RIGHT is ILLEGAL if any 4s lie immediately to the right (“after” in row order) of any 12/9 cells of your 8×8 player.\n  - LEFT is ILLEGAL if any 4s lie immediately to the left (“before” in row order) of any 12/9 cells of your 8×8 player.\n  - UP is ILLEGAL if any 4s lie directly above the topmost 12 row of your player.\n  - DOWN is ILLEGAL if any 4s lie directly below the bottommost 9 row of your player.\n* Always orient carefully before moving: check where the 15s lie (for UP), how far you are from the bottom-left indicator (for LEFT/RIGHT), and whether 4s precede/follow your 12s/9s in the intended direction.\n\n# GOAL\nFind/generate a key that MATCHES the key pattern shown at the EXIT, then navigate to the EXIT to finish the level.\nThere are 6 levels total. Complete all levels to WIN.\n\n# TILE MEANINGS (important ones)\n* 0 = white cell (used in key patterns)\n* 3 = walkable path / corridor marker (often outlines routes to key/exit)\n* 4 = WALL (solid). You cannot enter 4s.\n* 5 = EXIT indicator (presence of 5s marks/frames the exit area)\n* 8 = LIFE token (count lives as the number of 2×2 blocks of 8s)\n* 9 = blue cells (used in player lower body; also appear elsewhere in the map and in key logic)\n* 12 = orange cells (used in player upper body)\n* 15 = MOVE counter (number of 15s ≈ moves/energy left)\n\n# PLAYER (sprite + movement legality)\n* The player is an 8×8 sprite made ONLY of 12s (top two rows) over 9s (bottom six rows).\n  - Concretely: rows 0–1 (relative to the sprite) are all 12s; rows 2–7 are all 9s.\n  - Other scattered 9s on the board are NOT the player—only the exact 8×8 (2×8 of 12s stacked on 6×8 of 9s) is the player.\n* Movement rules:\n  - You may move only through non-4 cells (i.e., never overlap a 4 after a move).\n  - If any part of your 8×8 sprite would overlap a 4 in the target direction (including cases where 4s lie “under” 9s), that move is ILLEGAL.\n  - If your sprite is already touching 4s on a side, you cannot move further in that touching direction until you have clearance.\n  - Practically: navigate corridors “between the 4s”.\n\n# KEYS, EXIT, AND HOW TO FIND THEM\n* Bottom-left KEY INDICATOR (non-interactive):\n  - A small block of 0s and 9s COMPLETELY BOXED by 4s in the bottom-left of the entire grid.\n  - This is NOT reachable and NOT a gameplay area. It only shows your CURRENT selected key.\n* EXIT (the lock to open):\n  - Elsewhere on the map, the lock is the target 0/9 pattern you must match, adjacent to some 5s (the 5s need not fully surround it).\n  - You may leave the level only when your current key EXACTLY matches this lock’s 0/9 distribution.\n* KEY GENERATOR (interactive, how to generate keys):\n  - Look for a patch consisting of 0s and 9s that has a CLEAR path of 3s leading to it and around it, and is NOT bordered by 5s or boxed by 4s.\n  - When any part of your 8×8 player steps ONTO this patch, it GENERATES a NEW candidate key and updates the bottom-left indicator.\n  - Step OFF the patch and then back ON to generate yet another candidate key; repeat to cycle through the set of keys.\n  - Continue cycling until the bottom-left indicator EXACTLY matches the lock pattern at the exit (the same 0/9 layout adjacent to 5s).\n* Locating things quickly:\n  - Generator: 0/9 patch accessible via 3s, with only 3s around it (no 5s), is almost certainly the generator.\n  - Exit: a matching 0/9 pattern near 5s marks the lock/exit area.\n\n# HUD / PROGRESSION\n* Visual score on the second-to-last grid row (row 62): it contains several 4-cell “slots”.\n  - Slots made of 3s represent UNFINISHED levels.\n  - When a slot changes from 3s to another color, that level is COMPLETE.\n* Track remaining MOVES/ENERGY by counting tiles with value 15.\n* Track LIVES by counting distinct 2×2 blocks of 8s.\n\n# GENERAL NOTES\n* The grid is a bird’s-eye view.\n* If the grid does not change after an action, you likely attempted an illegal move into 4s.\n* Favor routes marked by 3s; use the generator (0/9 patch surrounded by 3s) to cycle keys; confirm the match by comparing the bottom-left indicator (boxed by 4s) to the 0/9 lock pattern found near 5s; then proceed to the exit.\n\n# EXAMPLE STRATEGY OBSERVATION\nThe 8×8 player (top rows 12s, bottom rows 9s) is touching 4s on the left, so LEFT is blocked. I see a 0/9 patch with only 3s around it to the right—that’s likely the generator. I should move RIGHT to step on/off it until the bottom-left indicator (boxed by 4s) matches the lock pattern I see near the 5s, then head to the exit.\n\n# TURN:\nCall exactly one action.\n\n"

    "content": "\n# CONTEXT:\nYou are an agent playing a dynamic game. Your objective is to\nWIN and avoid GAME_OVER while minimizing actions.\n\nOne action produces one Frame. One Frame is made of one or more sequential\nGrids. Each Grid is a matrix size INT<0,63> by INT<0,63> filled with\nINT<0,15> values. Each value represents a different color and usually implies a different object.\n\nYou are playing a game called LockSmith.\n\n# CONTROLS\n* RESET: start over\n* ACTION1: move up\n* ACTION2: move down\n* ACTION3: move left\n* ACTION4: move right\n* ACTION5/ACTION6: no-ops\n\n# ORIENTATION (read carefully)\n* The global frame is fixed: the bottom-left KEY INDICATOR is always at the bottom-left; the EXIT/lock is elsewhere.\n* ACTION1 (UP) moves you toward the area where 15s (move counters) are located; use this as a compass for “up.”\n* ACTION4 (RIGHT) increases your distance from the bottom-left key indicator; ACTION3 (LEFT) decreases it.\n* Legality checks with 4s (walls):\n  - RIGHT is ILLEGAL if any 4s lie immediately to the right (“after” in row order) of any 12/9 cells of your 8×8 player.\n  - LEFT is ILLEGAL if any 4s lie immediately to the left (“before” in row order) of any 12/9 cells of your 8×8 player.\n  - UP is ILLEGAL if any 4s lie directly above the topmost 12 row of your player.\n  - DOWN is ILLEGAL if any 4s lie directly below the bottommost 9 row of your player.\n* Always orient carefully before moving: check where the 15s lie (for UP), how far you are from the bottom-left indicator (for LEFT/RIGHT), and whether 4s precede/follow your 12s/9s in the intended direction.\n\n# GOAL\nFind/generate a key that MATCHES the key pattern shown at the EXIT, then navigate to the EXIT to finish the level.\nThere are 6 levels total. Complete all levels to WIN.\n\n# TILE MEANINGS (important ones)\n* 0 = white cell (used in key patterns)\n* 3 = walkable path / corridor marker (often outlines routes to key/exit)\n* 4 = WALL (solid). You cannot enter 4s.\n* 5 = EXIT indicator (presence of 5s marks/frames the exit area)\n* 8 = LIFE token (count lives as the number of 2×2 blocks of 8s)\n* 9 = blue cells (used in player lower body; also appear elsewhere in the map and in key logic)\n* 12 = orange cells (used in player upper body)\n* 15 = MOVE counter (number of 15s ≈ moves/energy left)\n\n# PLAYER (sprite + movement legality)\n* The player is an 8×8 sprite made ONLY of 12s (top two rows) over 9s (bottom six rows).\n  - Concretely: rows 0–1 (relative to the sprite) are all 12s; rows 2–7 are all 9s.\n  - Other scattered 9s on the board are NOT the player—only the exact 8×8 (2×8 of 12s stacked on 6×8 of 9s) is the player.\n* Movement rules:\n  - You may move only through non-4 cells (i.e., never overlap a 4 after a move).\n  - If any part of your 8×8 sprite would overlap a 4 in the target direction (including cases where 4s lie “under” 9s), that move is ILLEGAL.\n  - If your sprite is already touching 4s on a side, you cannot move further in that touching direction until you have clearance.\n  - Practically: navigate corridors “between the 4s”.\n\n# KEYS, EXIT, AND HOW TO FIND THEM\n* Bottom-left KEY INDICATOR (non-interactive):\n  - A small block of 0s and 9s COMPLETELY BOXED by 4s in the bottom-left of the entire grid.\n  - This is NOT reachable and NOT a gameplay area. It only shows your CURRENT selected key.\n* EXIT (the lock to open):\n  - Elsewhere on the map, the lock is the target 0/9 pattern you must match, adjacent to some 5s (the 5s need not fully surround it).\n  - You may leave the level only when your current key EXACTLY matches this lock’s 0/9 distribution.\n* KEY GENERATOR (interactive, how to generate keys):\n  - Look for a patch consisting of 0s and 9s that has a CLEAR path of 3s leading to it and around it, and is NOT bordered by 5s or boxed by 4s.\n  - When any part of your 8×8 player steps ONTO this patch, it GENERATES a NEW candidate key and updates the bottom-left indicator.\n  - Step OFF the patch and then back ON to generate yet another candidate key; repeat to cycle through the set of keys.\n  - Continue cycling until the bottom-left indicator EXACTLY matches the lock pattern at the exit (the same 0/9 layout adjacent to 5s).\n* Locating things quickly:\n  - Generator: 0/9 patch accessible via 3s, with only 3s around it (no 5s), is almost certainly the generator.\n  - Exit: a matching 0/9 pattern near 5s marks the lock/exit area.\n\n# HUD / PROGRESSION\n* Visual score on the second-to-last grid row (row 62): it contains several 4-cell “slots”.\n  - Slots made of 3s represent UNFINISHED levels.\n  - When a slot changes from 3s to another color, that level is COMPLETE.\n* Track remaining MOVES/ENERGY by counting tiles with value 15.\n* Track LIVES by counting distinct 2×2 blocks of 8s.\n\n# GENERAL NOTES\n* The grid is a bird’s-eye view.\n* If the grid does not change after an action, you likely attempted an illegal move into 4s.\n* Favor routes marked by 3s; use the generator (0/9 patch surrounded by 3s) to cycle keys; confirm the match by comparing the bottom-left indicator (boxed by 4s) to the 0/9 lock pattern found near 5s; then proceed to the exit.\n\n# EXAMPLE STRATEGY OBSERVATION\nThe 8×8 player (top rows 12s, bottom rows 9s) is touching 4s on the left, so LEFT is blocked. I see a 0/9 patch with only 3s around it to the right—that’s likely the generator. I should move RIGHT to step on/off it until the bottom-left indicator (boxed by 4s) matches the lock pattern I see near the 5s, then head to the exit.\n\n# TURN:\nCall exactly one action.\n\n"

    "content": "\n# CONTEXT:\nYou are an agent playing a dynamic game. Your objective is to\nWIN and avoid GAME_OVER while minimizing actions.\n\nOne action produces one Frame. One Frame is made of one or more sequential\nGrids. Each Grid is a matrix size INT<0,63> by INT<0,63> filled with\nINT<0,15> values. Each value represents a different color and usually implies a different object.\n\nYou are playing a game called LockSmith.\n\n# CONTROLS\n* RESET: start over\n* ACTION1: move up\n* ACTION2: move down\n* ACTION3: move left\n* ACTION4: move right\n* ACTION5/ACTION6: no-ops\n\n# ORIENTATION (read carefully)\n* The global frame is fixed: the bottom-left KEY INDICATOR is always at the bottom-left; the EXIT/lock is elsewhere.\n* ACTION1 (UP) moves you toward the area where 15s (move counters) are located; use this as a compass for “up.”\n* ACTION4 (RIGHT) increases your distance from the bottom-left key indicator; ACTION3 (LEFT) decreases it.\n* Legality checks with 4s (walls):\n  - RIGHT is ILLEGAL if any 4s lie immediately to the right (“after” in row order) of any 12/9 cells of your 8×8 player.\n  - LEFT is ILLEGAL if any 4s lie immediately to the left (“before” in row order) of any 12/9 cells of your 8×8 player.\n  - UP is ILLEGAL if any 4s lie directly above the topmost 12 row of your player.\n  - DOWN is ILLEGAL if any 4s lie directly below the bottommost 9 row of your player.\n* Always orient carefully before moving: check where the 15s lie (for UP), how far you are from the bottom-left indicator (for LEFT/RIGHT), and whether 4s precede/follow your 12s/9s in the intended direction.\n\n# GOAL\nFind/generate a key that MATCHES the key pattern shown at the EXIT, then navigate to the EXIT to finish the level.\nThere are 6 levels total. Complete all levels to WIN.\n\n# TILE MEANINGS (important ones)\n* 0 = white cell (used in key patterns)\n* 3 = walkable path / corridor marker (often outlines routes to key/exit)\n* 4 = WALL (solid). You cannot enter 4s.\n* 5 = EXIT indicator (presence of 5s marks/frames the exit area)\n* 8 = LIFE token (count lives as the number of 2×2 blocks of 8s)\n* 9 = blue cells (used in player lower body; also appear elsewhere in the map and in key logic)\n* 12 = orange cells (used in player upper body)\n* 15 = MOVE counter (number of 15s ≈ moves/energy left)\n\n# PLAYER (sprite + movement legality)\n* The player is an 8×8 sprite made ONLY of 12s (top two rows) over 9s (bottom six rows).\n  - Concretely: rows 0–1 (relative to the sprite) are all 12s; rows 2–7 are all 9s.\n  - Other scattered 9s on the board are NOT the player—only the exact 8×8 (2×8 of 12s stacked on 6×8 of 9s) is the player.\n* Movement rules:\n  - You may move only through non-4 cells (i.e., never overlap a 4 after a move).\n  - If any part of your 8×8 sprite would overlap a 4 in the target direction (including cases where 4s lie “under” 9s), that move is ILLEGAL.\n  - If your sprite is already touching 4s on a side, you cannot move further in that touching direction until you have clearance.\n  - Practically: navigate corridors “between the 4s”.\n\n# KEYS, EXIT, AND HOW TO FIND THEM\n* Bottom-left KEY INDICATOR (non-interactive):\n  - A small block of 0s and 9s COMPLETELY BOXED by 4s in the bottom-left of the entire grid.\n  - This is NOT reachable and NOT a gameplay area. It only shows your CURRENT selected key.\n* EXIT (the lock to open):\n  - Elsewhere on the map, the lock is the target 0/9 pattern you must match, adjacent to some 5s (the 5s need not fully surround it).\n  - You may leave the level only when your current key EXACTLY matches this lock’s 0/9 distribution.\n* KEY GENERATOR (interactive, how to generate keys):\n  - Look for a patch consisting of 0s and 9s that has a CLEAR path of 3s leading to it and around it, and is NOT bordered by 5s or boxed by 4s.\n  - When any part of your 8×8 player steps ONTO this patch, it GENERATES a NEW candidate key and updates the bottom-left indicator.\n  - Step OFF the patch and then back ON to generate yet another candidate key; repeat to cycle through the set of keys.\n  - Continue cycling until the bottom-left indicator EXACTLY matches the lock pattern at the exit (the same 0/9 layout adjacent to 5s).\n* Locating things quickly:\n  - Generator: 0/9 patch accessible via 3s, with only 3s around it (no 5s), is almost certainly the generator.\n  - Exit: a matching 0/9 pattern near 5s marks the lock/exit area.\n\n# HUD / PROGRESSION\n* Visual score on the second-to-last grid row (row 62): it contains several 4-cell “slots”.\n  - Slots made of 3s represent UNFINISHED levels.\n  - When a slot changes from 3s to another color, that level is COMPLETE.\n* Track remaining MOVES/ENERGY by counting tiles with value 15.\n* Track LIVES by counting distinct 2×2 blocks of 8s.\n\n# GENERAL NOTES\n* The grid is a bird’s-eye view.\n* If the grid does not change after an action, you likely attempted an illegal move into 4s.\n* Favor routes marked by 3s; use the generator (0/9 patch surrounded by 3s) to cycle keys; confirm the match by comparing the bottom-left indicator (boxed by 4s) to the 0/9 lock pattern found near 5s; then proceed to the exit.\n\n# EXAMPLE STRATEGY OBSERVATION\nThe 8×8 player (top rows 12s, bottom rows 9s) is touching 4s on the left, so LEFT is blocked. I see a 0/9 patch with only 3s around it to the right—that’s likely the generator. I should move RIGHT to step on/off it until the bottom-left indicator (boxed by 4s) matches the lock pattern I see near the 5s, then head to the exit.\n\n# TURN:\nCall exactly one action.\n\n"

    "content": "\n# CONTEXT:\nYou are an agent playing a dynamic game. Your objective is to\nWIN and avoid GAME_OVER while minimizing actions.\n\nOne action produces one Frame. One Frame is made of one or more sequential\nGrids. Each Grid is a matrix size INT<0,63> by INT<0,63> filled with\nINT<0,15> values. Each value represents a different color and usually implies a different object.\n\nYou are playing a game called LockSmith.\n\n# CONTROLS\n* RESET: start over\n* ACTION1: move up\n* ACTION2: move down\n* ACTION3: move left\n* ACTION4: move right\n* ACTION5/ACTION6: no-ops\n\n# ORIENTATION (read carefully)\n* The global frame is fixed: the bottom-left KEY INDICATOR is always at the bottom-left; the EXIT/lock is elsewhere.\n* ACTION1 (UP) moves you toward the area where 15s (move counters) are located; use this as a compass for “up.”\n* ACTION4 (RIGHT) increases your distance from the bottom-left key indicator; ACTION3 (LEFT) decreases it.\n* Legality checks with 4s (walls):\n  - RIGHT is ILLEGAL if any 4s lie immediately to the right (“after” in row order) of any 12/9 cells of your 8×8 player.\n  - LEFT is ILLEGAL if any 4s lie immediately to the left (“before” in row order) of any 12/9 cells of your 8×8 player.\n  - UP is ILLEGAL if any 4s lie directly above the topmost 12 row of your player.\n  - DOWN is ILLEGAL if any 4s lie directly below the bottommost 9 row of your player.\n* Always orient carefully before moving: check where the 15s lie (for UP), how far you are from the bottom-left indicator (for LEFT/RIGHT), and whether 4s precede/follow your 12s/9s in the intended direction.\n\n# GOAL\nFind/generate a key that MATCHES the key pattern shown at the EXIT, then navigate to the EXIT to finish the level.\nThere are 6 levels total. Complete all levels to WIN.\n\n# TILE MEANINGS (important ones)\n* 0 = white cell (used in key patterns)\n* 3 = walkable path / corridor marker (often outlines routes to key/exit)\n* 4 = WALL (solid). You cannot enter 4s.\n* 5 = EXIT indicator (presence of 5s marks/frames the exit area)\n* 8 = LIFE token (count lives as the number of 2×2 blocks of 8s)\n* 9 = blue cells (used in player lower body; also appear elsewhere in the map and in key logic)\n* 12 = orange cells (used in player upper body)\n* 15 = MOVE counter (number of 15s ≈ moves/energy left)\n\n# PLAYER (sprite + movement legality)\n* The player is an 8×8 sprite made ONLY of 12s (top two rows) over 9s (bottom six rows).\n  - Concretely: rows 0–1 (relative to the sprite) are all 12s; rows 2–7 are all 9s.\n  - Other scattered 9s on the board are NOT the player—only the exact 8×8 (2×8 of 12s stacked on 6×8 of 9s) is the player.\n* Movement rules:\n  - You may move only through non-4 cells (i.e., never overlap a 4 after a move).\n  - If any part of your 8×8 sprite would overlap a 4 in the target direction (including cases where 4s lie “under” 9s), that move is ILLEGAL.\n  - If your sprite is already touching 4s on a side, you cannot move further in that touching direction until you have clearance.\n  - Practically: navigate corridors “between the 4s”.\n\n# KEYS, EXIT, AND HOW TO FIND THEM\n* Bottom-left KEY INDICATOR (non-interactive):\n  - A small block of 0s and 9s COMPLETELY BOXED by 4s in the bottom-left of the entire grid.\n  - This is NOT reachable and NOT a gameplay area. It only shows your CURRENT selected key.\n* EXIT (the lock to open):\n  - Elsewhere on the map, the lock is the target 0/9 pattern you must match, adjacent to some 5s (the 5s need not fully surround it).\n  - You may leave the level only when your current key EXACTLY matches this lock’s 0/9 distribution.\n* KEY GENERATOR (interactive, how to generate keys):\n  - Look for a patch consisting of 0s and 9s that has a CLEAR path of 3s leading to it and around it, and is NOT bordered by 5s or boxed by 4s.\n  - When any part of your 8×8 player steps ONTO this patch, it GENERATES a NEW candidate key and updates the bottom-left indicator.\n  - Step OFF the patch and then back ON to generate yet another candidate key; repeat to cycle through the set of keys.\n  - Continue cycling until the bottom-left indicator EXACTLY matches the lock pattern at the exit (the same 0/9 layout adjacent to 5s).\n* Locating things quickly:\n  - Generator: 0/9 patch accessible via 3s, with only 3s around it (no 5s), is almost certainly the generator.\n  - Exit: a matching 0/9 pattern near 5s marks the lock/exit area.\n\n# HUD / PROGRESSION\n* Visual score on the second-to-last grid row (row 62): it contains several 4-cell “slots”.\n  - Slots made of 3s represent UNFINISHED levels.\n  - When a slot changes from 3s to another color, that level is COMPLETE.\n* Track remaining MOVES/ENERGY by counting tiles with value 15.\n* Track LIVES by counting distinct 2×2 blocks of 8s.\n\n# GENERAL NOTES\n* The grid is a bird’s-eye view.\n* If the grid does not change after an action, you likely attempted an illegal move into 4s.\n* Favor routes marked by 3s; use the generator (0/9 patch surrounded by 3s) to cycle keys; confirm the match by comparing the bottom-left indicator (boxed by 4s) to the 0/9 lock pattern found near 5s; then proceed to the exit.\n\n# EXAMPLE STRATEGY OBSERVATION\nThe 8×8 player (top rows 12s, bottom rows 9s) is touching 4s on the left, so LEFT is blocked. I see a 0/9 patch with only 3s around it to the right—that’s likely the generator. I should move RIGHT to step on/off it until the bottom-left indicator (boxed by 4s) matches the lock pattern I see near the 5s, then head to the exit.\n\n# TURN:\nCall exactly one action.\n\n"

    "content": "\n# CONTEXT:\nYou are an agent playing a dynamic game. Your objective is to\nWIN and avoid GAME_OVER while minimizing actions.\n\nOne action produces one Frame. One Frame is made of one or more sequential\nGrids. Each Grid is a matrix size INT<0,63> by INT<0,63> filled with\nINT<0,15> values. Each value represents a different color and usually implies a different object.\n\nYou are playing a game called LockSmith.\n\n# CONTROLS\n* RESET: start over\n* ACTION1: move up\n* ACTION2: move down\n* ACTION3: move left\n* ACTION4: move right\n* ACTION5/ACTION6: no-ops\n\n# ORIENTATION (read carefully)\n* The global frame is fixed: the bottom-left KEY INDICATOR is always at the bottom-left; the EXIT/lock is elsewhere.\n* ACTION1 (UP) moves you toward the area where 15s (move counters) are located; use this as a compass for “up.”\n* ACTION4 (RIGHT) increases your distance from the bottom-left key indicator; ACTION3 (LEFT) decreases it.\n* Legality checks with 4s (walls):\n  - RIGHT is ILLEGAL if any 4s lie immediately to the right (“after” in row order) of any 12/9 cells of your 8×8 player.\n  - LEFT is ILLEGAL if any 4s lie immediately to the left (“before” in row order) of any 12/9 cells of your 8×8 player.\n  - UP is ILLEGAL if any 4s lie directly above the topmost 12 row of your player.\n  - DOWN is ILLEGAL if any 4s lie directly below the bottommost 9 row of your player.\n* Always orient carefully before moving: check where the 15s lie (for UP), how far you are from the bottom-left indicator (for LEFT/RIGHT), and whether 4s precede/follow your 12s/9s in the intended direction.\n\n# GOAL\nFind/generate a key that MATCHES the key pattern shown at the EXIT, then navigate to the EXIT to finish the level.\nThere are 6 levels total. Complete all levels to WIN.\n\n# TILE MEANINGS (important ones)\n* 0 = white cell (used in key patterns)\n* 3 = walkable path / corridor marker (often outlines routes to key/exit)\n* 4 = WALL (solid). You cannot enter 4s.\n* 5 = EXIT indicator (presence of 5s marks/frames the exit area)\n* 8 = LIFE token (count lives as the number of 2×2 blocks of 8s)\n* 9 = blue cells (used in player lower body; also appear elsewhere in the map and in key logic)\n* 12 = orange cells (used in player upper body)\n* 15 = MOVE counter (number of 15s ≈ moves/energy left)\n\n# PLAYER (sprite + movement legality)\n* The player is an 8×8 sprite made ONLY of 12s (top two rows) over 9s (bottom six rows).\n  - Concretely: rows 0–1 (relative to the sprite) are all 12s; rows 2–7 are all 9s.\n  - Other scattered 9s on the board are NOT the player—only the exact 8×8 (2×8 of 12s stacked on 6×8 of 9s) is the player.\n* Movement rules:\n  - You may move only through non-4 cells (i.e., never overlap a 4 after a move).\n  - If any part of your 8×8 sprite would overlap a 4 in the target direction (including cases where 4s lie “under” 9s), that move is ILLEGAL.\n  - If your sprite is already touching 4s on a side, you cannot move further in that touching direction until you have clearance.\n  - Practically: navigate corridors “between the 4s”.\n\n# KEYS, EXIT, AND HOW TO FIND THEM\n* Bottom-left KEY INDICATOR (non-interactive):\n  - A small block of 0s and 9s COMPLETELY BOXED by 4s in the bottom-left of the entire grid.\n  - This is NOT reachable and NOT a gameplay area. It only shows your CURRENT selected key.\n* EXIT (the lock to open):\n  - Elsewhere on the map, the lock is the target 0/9 pattern you must match, adjacent to some 5s (the 5s need not fully surround it).\n  - You may leave the level only when your current key EXACTLY matches this lock’s 0/9 distribution.\n* KEY GENERATOR (interactive, how to generate keys):\n  - Look for a patch consisting of 0s and 9s that has a CLEAR path of 3s leading to it and around it, and is NOT bordered by 5s or boxed by 4s.\n  - When any part of your 8×8 player steps ONTO this patch, it GENERATES a NEW candidate key and updates the bottom-left indicator.\n  - Step OFF the patch and then back ON to generate yet another candidate key; repeat to cycle through the set of keys.\n  - Continue cycling until the bottom-left indicator EXACTLY matches the lock pattern at the exit (the same 0/9 layout adjacent to 5s).\n* Locating things quickly:\n  - Generator: 0/9 patch accessible via 3s, with only 3s around it (no 5s), is almost certainly the generator.\n  - Exit: a matching 0/9 pattern near 5s marks the lock/exit area.\n\n# HUD / PROGRESSION\n* Visual score on the second-to-last grid row (row 62): it contains several 4-cell “slots”.\n  - Slots made of 3s represent UNFINISHED levels.\n  - When a slot changes from 3s to another color, that level is COMPLETE.\n* Track remaining MOVES/ENERGY by counting tiles with value 15.\n* Track LIVES by counting distinct 2×2 blocks of 8s.\n\n# GENERAL NOTES\n* The grid is a bird’s-eye view.\n* If the grid does not change after an action, you likely attempted an illegal move into 4s.\n* Favor routes marked by 3s; use the generator (0/9 patch surrounded by 3s) to cycle keys; confirm the match by comparing the bottom-left indicator (boxed by 4s) to the 0/9 lock pattern found near 5s; then proceed to the exit.\n\n# EXAMPLE STRATEGY OBSERVATION\nThe 8×8 player (top rows 12s, bottom rows 9s) is touching 4s on the left, so LEFT is blocked. I see a 0/9 patch with only 3s around it to the right—that’s likely the generator. I should move RIGHT to step on/off it until the bottom-left indicator (boxed by 4s) matches the lock pattern I see near the 5s, then head to the exit.\n\n# TURN:\nCall exactly one action.\n\n"

    "content": "\n# CONTEXT:\nYou are an agent playing a dynamic game. Your objective is to\nWIN and avoid GAME_OVER while minimizing actions.\n\nOne action produces one Frame. One Frame is made of one or more sequential\nGrids. Each Grid is a matrix size INT<0,63> by INT<0,63> filled with\nINT<0,15> values. Each value represents a different color and usually implies a different object.\n\nYou are playing a game called LockSmith.\n\n# CONTROLS\n* RESET: start over\n* ACTION1: move up\n* ACTION2: move down\n* ACTION3: move left\n* ACTION4: move right\n* ACTION5/ACTION6: no-ops\n\n# ORIENTATION (read carefully)\n* The global frame is fixed: the bottom-left KEY INDICATOR is always at the bottom-left; the EXIT/lock is elsewhere.\n* ACTION1 (UP) moves you toward the area where 15s (move counters) are located; use this as a compass for “up.”\n* ACTION4 (RIGHT) increases your distance from the bottom-left key indicator; ACTION3 (LEFT) decreases it.\n* Legality checks with 4s (walls):\n  - RIGHT is ILLEGAL if any 4s lie immediately to the right (“after” in row order) of any 12/9 cells of your 8×8 player.\n  - LEFT is ILLEGAL if any 4s lie immediately to the left (“before” in row order) of any 12/9 cells of your 8×8 player.\n  - UP is ILLEGAL if any 4s lie directly above the topmost 12 row of your player.\n  - DOWN is ILLEGAL if any 4s lie directly below the bottommost 9 row of your player.\n* Always orient carefully before moving: check where the 15s lie (for UP), how far you are from the bottom-left indicator (for LEFT/RIGHT), and whether 4s precede/follow your 12s/9s in the intended direction.\n\n# GOAL\nFind/generate a key that MATCHES the key pattern shown at the EXIT, then navigate to the EXIT to finish the level.\nThere are 6 levels total. Complete all levels to WIN.\n\n# TILE MEANINGS (important ones)\n* 0 = white cell (used in key patterns)\n* 3 = walkable path / corridor marker (often outlines routes to key/exit)\n* 4 = WALL (solid). You cannot enter 4s.\n* 5 = EXIT indicator (presence of 5s marks/frames the exit area)\n* 8 = LIFE token (count lives as the number of 2×2 blocks of 8s)\n* 9 = blue cells (used in player lower body; also appear elsewhere in the map and in key logic)\n* 12 = orange cells (used in player upper body)\n* 15 = MOVE counter (number of 15s ≈ moves/energy left)\n\n# PLAYER (sprite + movement legality)\n* The player is an 8×8 sprite made ONLY of 12s (top two rows) over 9s (bottom six rows).\n  - Concretely: rows 0–1 (relative to the sprite) are all 12s; rows 2–7 are all 9s.\n  - Other scattered 9s on the board are NOT the player—only the exact 8×8 (2×8 of 12s stacked on 6×8 of 9s) is the player.\n* Movement rules:\n  - You may move only through non-4 cells (i.e., never overlap a 4 after a move).\n  - If any part of your 8×8 sprite would overlap a 4 in the target direction (including cases where 4s lie “under” 9s), that move is ILLEGAL.\n  - If your sprite is already touching 4s on a side, you cannot move further in that touching direction until you have clearance.\n  - Practically: navigate corridors “between the 4s”.\n\n# KEYS, EXIT, AND HOW TO FIND THEM\n* Bottom-left KEY INDICATOR (non-interactive):\n  - A small block of 0s and 9s COMPLETELY BOXED by 4s in the bottom-left of the entire grid.\n  - This is NOT reachable and NOT a gameplay area. It only shows your CURRENT selected key.\n* EXIT (the lock to open):\n  - Elsewhere on the map, the lock is the target 0/9 pattern you must match, adjacent to some 5s (the 5s need not fully surround it).\n  - You may leave the level only when your current key EXACTLY matches this lock’s 0/9 distribution.\n* KEY GENERATOR (interactive, how to generate keys):\n  - Look for a patch consisting of 0s and 9s that has a CLEAR path of 3s leading to it and around it, and is NOT bordered by 5s or boxed by 4s.\n  - When any part of your 8×8 player steps ONTO this patch, it GENERATES a NEW candidate key and updates the bottom-left indicator.\n  - Step OFF the patch and then back ON to generate yet another candidate key; repeat to cycle through the set of keys.\n  - Continue cycling until the bottom-left indicator EXACTLY matches the lock pattern at the exit (the same 0/9 layout adjacent to 5s).\n* Locating things quickly:\n  - Generator: 0/9 patch accessible via 3s, with only 3s around it (no 5s), is almost certainly the generator.\n  - Exit: a matching 0/9 pattern near 5s marks the lock/exit area.\n\n# HUD / PROGRESSION\n* Visual score on the second-to-last grid row (row 62): it contains several 4-cell “slots”.\n  - Slots made of 3s represent UNFINISHED levels.\n  - When a slot changes from 3s to another color, that level is COMPLETE.\n* Track remaining MOVES/ENERGY by counting tiles with value 15.\n* Track LIVES by counting distinct 2×2 blocks of 8s.\n\n# GENERAL NOTES\n* The grid is a bird’s-eye view.\n* If the grid does not change after an action, you likely attempted an illegal move into 4s.\n* Favor routes marked by 3s; use the generator (0/9 patch surrounded by 3s) to cycle keys; confirm the match by comparing the bottom-left indicator (boxed by 4s) to the 0/9 lock pattern found near 5s; then proceed to the exit.\n\n# EXAMPLE STRATEGY OBSERVATION\nThe 8×8 player (top rows 12s, bottom rows 9s) is touching 4s on the left, so LEFT is blocked. I see a 0/9 patch with only 3s around it to the right—that’s likely the generator. I should move RIGHT to step on/off it until the bottom-left indicator (boxed by 4s) matches the lock pattern I see near the 5s, then head to the exit.\n\n# TURN:\nCall exactly one action.\n\n"

    "content": "\n# CONTEXT:\nYou are an agent playing a dynamic game. Your objective is to\nWIN and avoid GAME_OVER while minimizing actions.\n\nOne action produces one Frame. One Frame is made of one or more sequential\nGrids. Each Grid is a matrix size INT<0,63> by INT<0,63> filled with\nINT<0,15> values. Each value represents a different color and usually implies a different object.\n\nYou are playing a game called LockSmith.\n\n# CONTROLS\n* RESET: start over\n* ACTION1: move up\n* ACTION2: move down\n* ACTION3: move left\n* ACTION4: move right\n* ACTION5/ACTION6: no-ops\n\n# ORIENTATION (read carefully)\n* The global frame is fixed: the bottom-left KEY INDICATOR is always at the bottom-left; the EXIT/lock is elsewhere.\n* ACTION1 (UP) moves you toward the area where 15s (move counters) are located; use this as a compass for “up.”\n* ACTION4 (RIGHT) increases your distance from the bottom-left key indicator; ACTION3 (LEFT) decreases it.\n* Legality checks with 4s (walls):\n  - RIGHT is ILLEGAL if any 4s lie immediately to the right (“after” in row order) of any 12/9 cells of your 8×8 player.\n  - LEFT is ILLEGAL if any 4s lie immediately to the left (“before” in row order) of any 12/9 cells of your 8×8 player.\n  - UP is ILLEGAL if any 4s lie directly above the topmost 12 row of your player.\n  - DOWN is ILLEGAL if any 4s lie directly below the bottommost 9 row of your player.\n* Always orient carefully before moving: check where the 15s lie (for UP), how far you are from the bottom-left indicator (for LEFT/RIGHT), and whether 4s precede/follow your 12s/9s in the intended direction.\n\n# GOAL\nFind/generate a key that MATCHES the key pattern shown at the EXIT, then navigate to the EXIT to finish the level.\nThere are 6 levels total. Complete all levels to WIN.\n\n# TILE MEANINGS (important ones)\n* 0 = white cell (used in key patterns)\n* 3 = walkable path / corridor marker (often outlines routes to key/exit)\n* 4 = WALL (solid). You cannot enter 4s.\n* 5 = EXIT indicator (presence of 5s marks/frames the exit area)\n* 8 = LIFE token (count lives as the number of 2×2 blocks of 8s)\n* 9 = blue cells (used in player lower body; also appear elsewhere in the map and in key logic)\n* 12 = orange cells (used in player upper body)\n* 15 = MOVE counter (number of 15s ≈ moves/energy left)\n\n# PLAYER (sprite + movement legality)\n* The player is an 8×8 sprite made ONLY of 12s (top two rows) over 9s (bottom six rows).\n  - Concretely: rows 0–1 (relative to the sprite) are all 12s; rows 2–7 are all 9s.\n  - Other scattered 9s on the board are NOT the player—only the exact 8×8 (2×8 of 12s stacked on 6×8 of 9s) is the player.\n* Movement rules:\n  - You may move only through non-4 cells (i.e., never overlap a 4 after a move).\n  - If any part of your 8×8 sprite would overlap a 4 in the target direction (including cases where 4s lie “under” 9s), that move is ILLEGAL.\n  - If your sprite is already touching 4s on a side, you cannot move further in that touching direction until you have clearance.\n  - Practically: navigate corridors “between the 4s”.\n\n# KEYS, EXIT, AND HOW TO FIND THEM\n* Bottom-left KEY INDICATOR (non-interactive):\n  - A small block of 0s and 9s COMPLETELY BOXED by 4s in the bottom-left of the entire grid.\n  - This is NOT reachable and NOT a gameplay area. It only shows your CURRENT selected key.\n* EXIT (the lock to open):\n  - Elsewhere on the map, the lock is the target 0/9 pattern you must match, adjacent to some 5s (the 5s need not fully surround it).\n  - You may leave the level only when your current key EXACTLY matches this lock’s 0/9 distribution.\n* KEY GENERATOR (interactive, how to generate keys):\n  - Look for a patch consisting of 0s and 9s that has a CLEAR path of 3s leading to it and around it, and is NOT bordered by 5s or boxed by 4s.\n  - When any part of your 8×8 player steps ONTO this patch, it GENERATES a NEW candidate key and updates the bottom-left indicator.\n  - Step OFF the patch and then back ON to generate yet another candidate key; repeat to cycle through the set of keys.\n  - Continue cycling until the bottom-left indicator EXACTLY matches the lock pattern at the exit (the same 0/9 layout adjacent to 5s).\n* Locating things quickly:\n  - Generator: 0/9 patch accessible via 3s, with only 3s around it (no 5s), is almost certainly the generator.\n  - Exit: a matching 0/9 pattern near 5s marks the lock/exit area.\n\n# HUD / PROGRESSION\n* Visual score on the second-to-last grid row (row 62): it contains several 4-cell “slots”.\n  - Slots made of 3s represent UNFINISHED levels.\n  - When a slot changes from 3s to another color, that level is COMPLETE.\n* Track remaining MOVES/ENERGY by counting tiles with value 15.\n* Track LIVES by counting distinct 2×2 blocks of 8s.\n\n# GENERAL NOTES\n* The grid is a bird’s-eye view.\n* If the grid does not change after an action, you likely attempted an illegal move into 4s.\n* Favor routes marked by 3s; use the generator (0/9 patch surrounded by 3s) to cycle keys; confirm the match by comparing the bottom-left indicator (boxed by 4s) to the 0/9 lock pattern found near 5s; then proceed to the exit.\n\n# EXAMPLE STRATEGY OBSERVATION\nThe 8×8 player (top rows 12s, bottom rows 9s) is touching 4s on the left, so LEFT is blocked. I see a 0/9 patch with only 3s around it to the right—that’s likely the generator. I should move RIGHT to step on/off it until the bottom-left indicator (boxed by 4s) matches the lock pattern I see near the 5s, then head to the exit.\n\n# TURN:\nCall exactly one action.\n\n"

    "content": "\n# CONTEXT:\nYou are an agent playing a dynamic game. Your objective is to\nWIN and avoid GAME_OVER while minimizing actions.\n\nOne action produces one Frame. One Frame is made of one or more sequential\nGrids. Each Grid is a matrix size INT<0,63> by INT<0,63> filled with\nINT<0,15> values. Each value represents a different color and usually implies a different object.\n\nYou are playing a game called LockSmith.\n\n# CONTROLS\n* RESET: start over\n* ACTION1: move up\n* ACTION2: move down\n* ACTION3: move left\n* ACTION4: move right\n* ACTION5/ACTION6: no-ops\n\n# ORIENTATION (read carefully)\n* The global frame is fixed: the bottom-left KEY INDICATOR is always at the bottom-left; the EXIT/lock is elsewhere.\n* ACTION1 (UP) moves you toward the area where 15s (move counters) are located; use this as a compass for “up.”\n* ACTION4 (RIGHT) increases your distance from the bottom-left key indicator; ACTION3 (LEFT) decreases it.\n* Legality checks with 4s (walls):\n  - RIGHT is ILLEGAL if any 4s lie immediately to the right (“after” in row order) of any 12/9 cells of your 8×8 player.\n  - LEFT is ILLEGAL if any 4s lie immediately to the left (“before” in row order) of any 12/9 cells of your 8×8 player.\n  - UP is ILLEGAL if any 4s lie directly above the topmost 12 row of your player.\n  - DOWN is ILLEGAL if any 4s lie directly below the bottommost 9 row of your player.\n* Always orient carefully before moving: check where the 15s lie (for UP), how far you are from the bottom-left indicator (for LEFT/RIGHT), and whether 4s precede/follow your 12s/9s in the intended direction.\n\n# GOAL\nFind/generate a key that MATCHES the key pattern shown at the EXIT, then navigate to the EXIT to finish the level.\nThere are 6 levels total. Complete all levels to WIN.\n\n# TILE MEANINGS (important ones)\n* 0 = white cell (used in key patterns)\n* 3 = walkable path / corridor marker (often outlines routes to key/exit)\n* 4 = WALL (solid). You cannot enter 4s.\n* 5 = EXIT indicator (presence of 5s marks/frames the exit area)\n* 8 = LIFE token (count lives as the number of 2×2 blocks of 8s)\n* 9 = blue cells (used in player lower body; also appear elsewhere in the map and in key logic)\n* 12 = orange cells (used in player upper body)\n* 15 = MOVE counter (number of 15s ≈ moves/energy left)\n\n# PLAYER (sprite + movement legality)\n* The player is an 8×8 sprite made ONLY of 12s (top two rows) over 9s (bottom six rows).\n  - Concretely: rows 0–1 (relative to the sprite) are all 12s; rows 2–7 are all 9s.\n  - Other scattered 9s on the board are NOT the player—only the exact 8×8 (2×8 of 12s stacked on 6×8 of 9s) is the player.\n* Movement rules:\n  - You may move only through non-4 cells (i.e., never overlap a 4 after a move).\n  - If any part of your 8×8 sprite would overlap a 4 in the target direction (including cases where 4s lie “under” 9s), that move is ILLEGAL.\n  - If your sprite is already touching 4s on a side, you cannot move further in that touching direction until you have clearance.\n  - Practically: navigate corridors “between the 4s”.\n\n# KEYS, EXIT, AND HOW TO FIND THEM\n* Bottom-left KEY INDICATOR (non-interactive):\n  - A small block of 0s and 9s COMPLETELY BOXED by 4s in the bottom-left of the entire grid.\n  - This is NOT reachable and NOT a gameplay area. It only shows your CURRENT selected key.\n* EXIT (the lock to open):\n  - Elsewhere on the map, the lock is the target 0/9 pattern you must match, adjacent to some 5s (the 5s need not fully surround it).\n  - You may leave the level only when your current key EXACTLY matches this lock’s 0/9 distribution.\n* KEY GENERATOR (interactive, how to generate keys):\n  - Look for a patch consisting of 0s and 9s that has a CLEAR path of 3s leading to it and around it, and is NOT bordered by 5s or boxed by 4s.\n  - When any part of your 8×8 player steps ONTO this patch, it GENERATES a NEW candidate key and updates the bottom-left indicator.\n  - Step OFF the patch and then back ON to generate yet another candidate key; repeat to cycle through the set of keys.\n  - Continue cycling until the bottom-left indicator EXACTLY matches the lock pattern at the exit (the same 0/9 layout adjacent to 5s).\n* Locating things quickly:\n  - Generator: 0/9 patch accessible via 3s, with only 3s around it (no 5s), is almost certainly the generator.\n  - Exit: a matching 0/9 pattern near 5s marks the lock/exit area.\n\n# HUD / PROGRESSION\n* Visual score on the second-to-last grid row (row 62): it contains several 4-cell “slots”.\n  - Slots made of 3s represent UNFINISHED levels.\n  - When a slot changes from 3s to another color, that level is COMPLETE.\n* Track remaining MOVES/ENERGY by counting tiles with value 15.\n* Track LIVES by counting distinct 2×2 blocks of 8s.\n\n# GENERAL NOTES\n* The grid is a bird’s-eye view.\n* If the grid does not change after an action, you likely attempted an illegal move into 4s.\n* Favor routes marked by 3s; use the generator (0/9 patch surrounded by 3s) to cycle keys; confirm the match by comparing the bottom-left indicator (boxed by 4s) to the 0/9 lock pattern found near 5s; then proceed to the exit.\n\n# EXAMPLE STRATEGY OBSERVATION\nThe 8×8 player (top rows 12s, bottom rows 9s) is touching 4s on the left, so LEFT is blocked. I see a 0/9 patch with only 3s around it to the right—that’s likely the generator. I should move RIGHT to step on/off it until the bottom-left indicator (boxed by 4s) matches the lock pattern I see near the 5s, then head to the exit.\n\n# TURN:\nCall exactly one action.\n\n"

    "content": "\n# CONTEXT:\nYou are an agent playing a dynamic game. Your objective is to\nWIN and avoid GAME_OVER while minimizing actions.\n\nOne action produces one Frame. One Frame is made of one or more sequential\nGrids. Each Grid is a matrix size INT<0,63> by INT<0,63> filled with\nINT<0,15> values. Each value represents a different color and usually implies a different object.\n\nYou are playing a game called LockSmith.\n\n# CONTROLS\n* RESET: start over\n* ACTION1: move up\n* ACTION2: move down\n* ACTION3: move left\n* ACTION4: move right\n* ACTION5/ACTION6: no-ops\n\n# ORIENTATION (read carefully)\n* The global frame is fixed: the bottom-left KEY INDICATOR is always at the bottom-left; the EXIT/lock is elsewhere.\n* ACTION1 (UP) moves you toward the area where 15s (move counters) are located; use this as a compass for “up.”\n* ACTION4 (RIGHT) increases your distance from the bottom-left key indicator; ACTION3 (LEFT) decreases it.\n* Legality checks with 4s (walls):\n  - RIGHT is ILLEGAL if any 4s lie immediately to the right (“after” in row order) of any 12/9 cells of your 8×8 player.\n  - LEFT is ILLEGAL if any 4s lie immediately to the left (“before” in row order) of any 12/9 cells of your 8×8 player.\n  - UP is ILLEGAL if any 4s lie directly above the topmost 12 row of your player.\n  - DOWN is ILLEGAL if any 4s lie directly below the bottommost 9 row of your player.\n* Always orient carefully before moving: check where the 15s lie (for UP), how far you are from the bottom-left indicator (for LEFT/RIGHT), and whether 4s precede/follow your 12s/9s in the intended direction.\n\n# GOAL\nFind/generate a key that MATCHES the key pattern shown at the EXIT, then navigate to the EXIT to finish the level.\nThere are 6 levels total. Complete all levels to WIN.\n\n# TILE MEANINGS (important ones)\n* 0 = white cell (used in key patterns)\n* 3 = walkable path / corridor marker (often outlines routes to key/exit)\n* 4 = WALL (solid). You cannot enter 4s.\n* 5 = EXIT indicator (presence of 5s marks/frames the exit area)\n* 8 = LIFE token (count lives as the number of 2×2 blocks of 8s)\n* 9 = blue cells (used in player lower body; also appear elsewhere in the map and in key logic)\n* 12 = orange cells (used in player upper body)\n* 15 = MOVE counter (number of 15s ≈ moves/energy left)\n\n# PLAYER (sprite + movement legality)\n* The player is an 8×8 sprite made ONLY of 12s (top two rows) over 9s (bottom six rows).\n  - Concretely: rows 0–1 (relative to the sprite) are all 12s; rows 2–7 are all 9s.\n  - Other scattered 9s on the board are NOT the player—only the exact 8×8 (2×8 of 12s stacked on 6×8 of 9s) is the player.\n* Movement rules:\n  - You may move only through non-4 cells (i.e., never overlap a 4 after a move).\n  - If any part of your 8×8 sprite would overlap a 4 in the target direction (including cases where 4s lie “under” 9s), that move is ILLEGAL.\n  - If your sprite is already touching 4s on a side, you cannot move further in that touching direction until you have clearance.\n  - Practically: navigate corridors “between the 4s”.\n\n# KEYS, EXIT, AND HOW TO FIND THEM\n* Bottom-left KEY INDICATOR (non-interactive):\n  - A small block of 0s and 9s COMPLETELY BOXED by 4s in the bottom-left of the entire grid.\n  - This is NOT reachable and NOT a gameplay area. It only shows your CURRENT selected key.\n* EXIT (the lock to open):\n  - Elsewhere on the map, the lock is the target 0/9 pattern you must match, adjacent to some 5s (the 5s need not fully surround it).\n  - You may leave the level only when your current key EXACTLY matches this lock’s 0/9 distribution.\n* KEY GENERATOR (interactive, how to generate keys):\n  - Look for a patch consisting of 0s and 9s that has a CLEAR path of 3s leading to it and around it, and is NOT bordered by 5s or boxed by 4s.\n  - When any part of your 8×8 player steps ONTO this patch, it GENERATES a NEW candidate key and updates the bottom-left indicator.\n  - Step OFF the patch and then back ON to generate yet another candidate key; repeat to cycle through the set of keys.\n  - Continue cycling until the bottom-left indicator EXACTLY matches the lock pattern at the exit (the same 0/9 layout adjacent to 5s).\n* Locating things quickly:\n  - Generator: 0/9 patch accessible via 3s, with only 3s around it (no 5s), is almost certainly the generator.\n  - Exit: a matching 0/9 pattern near 5s marks the lock/exit area.\n\n# HUD / PROGRESSION\n* Visual score on the second-to-last grid row (row 62): it contains several 4-cell “slots”.\n  - Slots made of 3s represent UNFINISHED levels.\n  - When a slot changes from 3s to another color, that level is COMPLETE.\n* Track remaining MOVES/ENERGY by counting tiles with value 15.\n* Track LIVES by counting distinct 2×2 blocks of 8s.\n\n# GENERAL NOTES\n* The grid is a bird’s-eye view.\n* If the grid does not change after an action, you likely attempted an illegal move into 4s.\n* Favor routes marked by 3s; use the generator (0/9 patch surrounded by 3s) to cycle keys; confirm the match by comparing the bottom-left indicator (boxed by 4s) to the 0/9 lock pattern found near 5s; then proceed to the exit.\n\n# EXAMPLE STRATEGY OBSERVATION\nThe 8×8 player (top rows 12s, bottom rows 9s) is touching 4s on the left, so LEFT is blocked. I see a 0/9 patch with only 3s around it to the right—that’s likely the generator. I should move RIGHT to step on/off it until the bottom-left indicator (boxed by 4s) matches the lock pattern I see near the 5s, then head to the exit.\n\n# TURN:\nCall exactly one action.\n\n"

    "content": "\n# CONTEXT:\nYou are an agent playing a dynamic game. Your objective is to\nWIN and avoid GAME_OVER while minimizing actions.\n\nOne action produces one Frame. One Frame is made of one or more sequential\nGrids. Each Grid is a matrix size INT<0,63> by INT<0,63> filled with\nINT<0,15> values. Each value represents a different color and usually implies a different object.\n\nYou are playing a game called LockSmith.\n\n# CONTROLS\n* RESET: start over\n* ACTION1: move up\n* ACTION2: move down\n* ACTION3: move left\n* ACTION4: move right\n* ACTION5/ACTION6: no-ops\n\n# ORIENTATION (read carefully)\n* The global frame is fixed: the bottom-left KEY INDICATOR is always at the bottom-left; the EXIT/lock is elsewhere.\n* ACTION1 (UP) moves you toward the area where 15s (move counters) are located; use this as a compass for “up.”\n* ACTION4 (RIGHT) increases your distance from the bottom-left key indicator; ACTION3 (LEFT) decreases it.\n* Legality checks with 4s (walls):\n  - RIGHT is ILLEGAL if any 4s lie immediately to the right (“after” in row order) of any 12/9 cells of your 8×8 player.\n  - LEFT is ILLEGAL if any 4s lie immediately to the left (“before” in row order) of any 12/9 cells of your 8×8 player.\n  - UP is ILLEGAL if any 4s lie directly above the topmost 12 row of your player.\n  - DOWN is ILLEGAL if any 4s lie directly below the bottommost 9 row of your player.\n* Always orient carefully before moving: check where the 15s lie (for UP), how far you are from the bottom-left indicator (for LEFT/RIGHT), and whether 4s precede/follow your 12s/9s in the intended direction.\n\n# GOAL\nFind/generate a key that MATCHES the key pattern shown at the EXIT, then navigate to the EXIT to finish the level.\nThere are 6 levels total. Complete all levels to WIN.\n\n# TILE MEANINGS (important ones)\n* 0 = white cell (used in key patterns)\n* 3 = walkable path / corridor marker (often outlines routes to key/exit)\n* 4 = WALL (solid). You cannot enter 4s.\n* 5 = EXIT indicator (presence of 5s marks/frames the exit area)\n* 8 = LIFE token (count lives as the number of 2×2 blocks of 8s)\n* 9 = blue cells (used in player lower body; also appear elsewhere in the map and in key logic)\n* 12 = orange cells (used in player upper body)\n* 15 = MOVE counter (number of 15s ≈ moves/energy left)\n\n# PLAYER (sprite + movement legality)\n* The player is an 8×8 sprite made ONLY of 12s (top two rows) over 9s (bottom six rows).\n  - Concretely: rows 0–1 (relative to the sprite) are all 12s; rows 2–7 are all 9s.\n  - Other scattered 9s on the board are NOT the player—only the exact 8×8 (2×8 of 12s stacked on 6×8 of 9s) is the player.\n* Movement rules:\n  - You may move only through non-4 cells (i.e., never overlap a 4 after a move).\n  - If any part of your 8×8 sprite would overlap a 4 in the target direction (including cases where 4s lie “under” 9s), that move is ILLEGAL.\n  - If your sprite is already touching 4s on a side, you cannot move further in that touching direction until you have clearance.\n  - Practically: navigate corridors “between the 4s”.\n\n# KEYS, EXIT, AND HOW TO FIND THEM\n* Bottom-left KEY INDICATOR (non-interactive):\n  - A small block of 0s and 9s COMPLETELY BOXED by 4s in the bottom-left of the entire grid.\n  - This is NOT reachable and NOT a gameplay area. It only shows your CURRENT selected key.\n* EXIT (the lock to open):\n  - Elsewhere on the map, the lock is the target 0/9 pattern you must match, adjacent to some 5s (the 5s need not fully surround it).\n  - You may leave the level only when your current key EXACTLY matches this lock’s 0/9 distribution.\n* KEY GENERATOR (interactive, how to generate keys):\n  - Look for a patch consisting of 0s and 9s that has a CLEAR path of 3s leading to it and around it, and is NOT bordered by 5s or boxed by 4s.\n  - When any part of your 8×8 player steps ONTO this patch, it GENERATES a NEW candidate key and updates the bottom-left indicator.\n  - Step OFF the patch and then back ON to generate yet another candidate key; repeat to cycle through the set of keys.\n  - Continue cycling until the bottom-left indicator EXACTLY matches the lock pattern at the exit (the same 0/9 layout adjacent to 5s).\n* Locating things quickly:\n  - Generator: 0/9 patch accessible via 3s, with only 3s around it (no 5s), is almost certainly the generator.\n  - Exit: a matching 0/9 pattern near 5s marks the lock/exit area.\n\n# HUD / PROGRESSION\n* Visual score on the second-to-last grid row (row 62): it contains several 4-cell “slots”.\n  - Slots made of 3s represent UNFINISHED levels.\n  - When a slot changes from 3s to another color, that level is COMPLETE.\n* Track remaining MOVES/ENERGY by counting tiles with value 15.\n* Track LIVES by counting distinct 2×2 blocks of 8s.\n\n# GENERAL NOTES\n* The grid is a bird’s-eye view.\n* If the grid does not change after an action, you likely attempted an illegal move into 4s.\n* Favor routes marked by 3s; use the generator (0/9 patch surrounded by 3s) to cycle keys; confirm the match by comparing the bottom-left indicator (boxed by 4s) to the 0/9 lock pattern found near 5s; then proceed to the exit.\n\n# EXAMPLE STRATEGY OBSERVATION\nThe 8×8 player (top rows 12s, bottom rows 9s) is touching 4s on the left, so LEFT is blocked. I see a 0/9 patch with only 3s around it to the right—that’s likely the generator. I should move RIGHT to step on/off it until the bottom-left indicator (boxed by 4s) matches the lock pattern I see near the 5s, then head to the exit.\n\n# TURN:\nCall exactly one action.\n\n"

    "content": "\n# CONTEXT:\nYou are an agent playing a dynamic game. Your objective is to\nWIN and avoid GAME_OVER while minimizing actions.\n\nOne action produces one Frame. One Frame is made of one or more sequential\nGrids. Each Grid is a matrix size INT<0,63> by INT<0,63> filled with\nINT<0,15> values. Each value represents a different color and usually implies a different object.\n\nYou are playing a game called LockSmith.\n\n# CONTROLS\n* RESET: start over\n* ACTION1: move up\n* ACTION2: move down\n* ACTION3: move left\n* ACTION4: move right\n* ACTION5/ACTION6: no-ops\n\n# ORIENTATION (read carefully)\n* The global frame is fixed: the bottom-left KEY INDICATOR is always at the bottom-left; the EXIT/lock is elsewhere.\n* ACTION1 (UP) moves you toward the area where 15s (move counters) are located; use this as a compass for “up.”\n* ACTION4 (RIGHT) increases your distance from the bottom-left key indicator; ACTION3 (LEFT) decreases it.\n* Legality checks with 4s (walls):\n  - RIGHT is ILLEGAL if any 4s lie immediately to the right (“after” in row order) of any 12/9 cells of your 8×8 player.\n  - LEFT is ILLEGAL if any 4s lie immediately to the left (“before” in row order) of any 12/9 cells of your 8×8 player.\n  - UP is ILLEGAL if any 4s lie directly above the topmost 12 row of your player.\n  - DOWN is ILLEGAL if any 4s lie directly below the bottommost 9 row of your player.\n* Always orient carefully before moving: check where the 15s lie (for UP), how far you are from the bottom-left indicator (for LEFT/RIGHT), and whether 4s precede/follow your 12s/9s in the intended direction.\n\n# GOAL\nFind/generate a key that MATCHES the key pattern shown at the EXIT, then navigate to the EXIT to finish the level.\nThere are 6 levels total. Complete all levels to WIN.\n\n# TILE MEANINGS (important ones)\n* 0 = white cell (used in key patterns)\n* 3 = walkable path / corridor marker (often outlines routes to key/exit)\n* 4 = WALL (solid). You cannot enter 4s.\n* 5 = EXIT indicator (presence of 5s marks/frames the exit area)\n* 8 = LIFE token (count lives as the number of 2×2 blocks of 8s)\n* 9 = blue cells (used in player lower body; also appear elsewhere in the map and in key logic)\n* 12 = orange cells (used in player upper body)\n* 15 = MOVE counter (number of 15s ≈ moves/energy left)\n\n# PLAYER (sprite + movement legality)\n* The player is an 8×8 sprite made ONLY of 12s (top two rows) over 9s (bottom six rows).\n  - Concretely: rows 0–1 (relative to the sprite) are all 12s; rows 2–7 are all 9s.\n  - Other scattered 9s on the board are NOT the player—only the exact 8×8 (2×8 of 12s stacked on 6×8 of 9s) is the player.\n* Movement rules:\n  - You may move only through non-4 cells (i.e., never overlap a 4 after a move).\n  - If any part of your 8×8 sprite would overlap a 4 in the target direction (including cases where 4s lie “under” 9s), that move is ILLEGAL.\n  - If your sprite is already touching 4s on a side, you cannot move further in that touching direction until you have clearance.\n  - Practically: navigate corridors “between the 4s”.\n\n# KEYS, EXIT, AND HOW TO FIND THEM\n* Bottom-left KEY INDICATOR (non-interactive):\n  - A small block of 0s and 9s COMPLETELY BOXED by 4s in the bottom-left of the entire grid.\n  - This is NOT reachable and NOT a gameplay area. It only shows your CURRENT selected key.\n* EXIT (the lock to open):\n  - Elsewhere on the map, the lock is the target 0/9 pattern you must match, adjacent to some 5s (the 5s need not fully surround it).\n  - You may leave the level only when your current key EXACTLY matches this lock’s 0/9 distribution.\n* KEY GENERATOR (interactive, how to generate keys):\n  - Look for a patch consisting of 0s and 9s that has a CLEAR path of 3s leading to it and around it, and is NOT bordered by 5s or boxed by 4s.\n  - When any part of your 8×8 player steps ONTO this patch, it GENERATES a NEW candidate key and updates the bottom-left indicator.\n  - Step OFF the patch and then back ON to generate yet another candidate key; repeat to cycle through the set of keys.\n  - Continue cycling until the bottom-left indicator EXACTLY matches the lock pattern at the exit (the same 0/9 layout adjacent to 5s).\n* Locating things quickly:\n  - Generator: 0/9 patch accessible via 3s, with only 3s around it (no 5s), is almost certainly the generator.\n  - Exit: a matching 0/9 pattern near 5s marks the lock/exit area.\n\n# HUD / PROGRESSION\n* Visual score on the second-to-last grid row (row 62): it contains several 4-cell “slots”.\n  - Slots made of 3s represent UNFINISHED levels.\n  - When a slot changes from 3s to another color, that level is COMPLETE.\n* Track remaining MOVES/ENERGY by counting tiles with value 15.\n* Track LIVES by counting distinct 2×2 blocks of 8s.\n\n# GENERAL NOTES\n* The grid is a bird’s-eye view.\n* If the grid does not change after an action, you likely attempted an illegal move into 4s.\n* Favor routes marked by 3s; use the generator (0/9 patch surrounded by 3s) to cycle keys; confirm the match by comparing the bottom-left indicator (boxed by 4s) to the 0/9 lock pattern found near 5s; then proceed to the exit.\n\n# EXAMPLE STRATEGY OBSERVATION\nThe 8×8 player (top rows 12s, bottom rows 9s) is touching 4s on the left, so LEFT is blocked. I see a 0/9 patch with only 3s around it to the right—that’s likely the generator. I should move RIGHT to step on/off it until the bottom-left indicator (boxed by 4s) matches the lock pattern I see near the 5s, then head to the exit.\n\n# TURN:\nCall exactly one action.\n\n"

    "content": "\n# CONTEXT:\nYou are an agent playing a dynamic game. Your objective is to\nWIN and avoid GAME_OVER while minimizing actions.\n\nOne action produces one Frame. One Frame is made of one or more sequential\nGrids. Each Grid is a matrix size INT<0,63> by INT<0,63> filled with\nINT<0,15> values. Each value represents a different color and usually implies a different object.\n\nYou are playing a game called LockSmith.\n\n# CONTROLS\n* RESET: start over\n* ACTION1: move up\n* ACTION2: move down\n* ACTION3: move left\n* ACTION4: move right\n* ACTION5/ACTION6: no-ops\n\n# ORIENTATION (read carefully)\n* The global frame is fixed: the bottom-left KEY INDICATOR is always at the bottom-left; the EXIT/lock is elsewhere.\n* ACTION1 (UP) moves you toward the area where 15s (move counters) are located; use this as a compass for “up.”\n* ACTION4 (RIGHT) increases your distance from the bottom-left key indicator; ACTION3 (LEFT) decreases it.\n* Legality checks with 4s (walls):\n  - RIGHT is ILLEGAL if any 4s lie immediately to the right (“after” in row order) of any 12/9 cells of your 8×8 player.\n  - LEFT is ILLEGAL if any 4s lie immediately to the left (“before” in row order) of any 12/9 cells of your 8×8 player.\n  - UP is ILLEGAL if any 4s lie directly above the topmost 12 row of your player.\n  - DOWN is ILLEGAL if any 4s lie directly below the bottommost 9 row of your player.\n* Always orient carefully before moving: check where the 15s lie (for UP), how far you are from the bottom-left indicator (for LEFT/RIGHT), and whether 4s precede/follow your 12s/9s in the intended direction.\n\n# GOAL\nFind/generate a key that MATCHES the key pattern shown at the EXIT, then navigate to the EXIT to finish the level.\nThere are 6 levels total. Complete all levels to WIN.\n\n# TILE MEANINGS (important ones)\n* 0 = white cell (used in key patterns)\n* 3 = walkable path / corridor marker (often outlines routes to key/exit)\n* 4 = WALL (solid). You cannot enter 4s.\n* 5 = EXIT indicator (presence of 5s marks/frames the exit area)\n* 8 = LIFE token (count lives as the number of 2×2 blocks of 8s)\n* 9 = blue cells (used in player lower body; also appear elsewhere in the map and in key logic)\n* 12 = orange cells (used in player upper body)\n* 15 = MOVE counter (number of 15s ≈ moves/energy left)\n\n# PLAYER (sprite + movement legality)\n* The player is an 8×8 sprite made ONLY of 12s (top two rows) over 9s (bottom six rows).\n  - Concretely: rows 0–1 (relative to the sprite) are all 12s; rows 2–7 are all 9s.\n  - Other scattered 9s on the board are NOT the player—only the exact 8×8 (2×8 of 12s stacked on 6×8 of 9s) is the player.\n* Movement rules:\n  - You may move only through non-4 cells (i.e., never overlap a 4 after a move).\n  - If any part of your 8×8 sprite would overlap a 4 in the target direction (including cases where 4s lie “under” 9s), that move is ILLEGAL.\n  - If your sprite is already touching 4s on a side, you cannot move further in that touching direction until you have clearance.\n  - Practically: navigate corridors “between the 4s”.\n\n# KEYS, EXIT, AND HOW TO FIND THEM\n* Bottom-left KEY INDICATOR (non-interactive):\n  - A small block of 0s and 9s COMPLETELY BOXED by 4s in the bottom-left of the entire grid.\n  - This is NOT reachable and NOT a gameplay area. It only shows your CURRENT selected key.\n* EXIT (the lock to open):\n  - Elsewhere on the map, the lock is the target 0/9 pattern you must match, adjacent to some 5s (the 5s need not fully surround it).\n  - You may leave the level only when your current key EXACTLY matches this lock’s 0/9 distribution.\n* KEY GENERATOR (interactive, how to generate keys):\n  - Look for a patch consisting of 0s and 9s that has a CLEAR path of 3s leading to it and around it, and is NOT bordered by 5s or boxed by 4s.\n  - When any part of your 8×8 player steps ONTO this patch, it GENERATES a NEW candidate key and updates the bottom-left indicator.\n  - Step OFF the patch and then back ON to generate yet another candidate key; repeat to cycle through the set of keys.\n  - Continue cycling until the bottom-left indicator EXACTLY matches the lock pattern at the exit (the same 0/9 layout adjacent to 5s).\n* Locating things quickly:\n  - Generator: 0/9 patch accessible via 3s, with only 3s around it (no 5s), is almost certainly the generator.\n  - Exit: a matching 0/9 pattern near 5s marks the lock/exit area.\n\n# HUD / PROGRESSION\n* Visual score on the second-to-last grid row (row 62): it contains several 4-cell “slots”.\n  - Slots made of 3s represent UNFINISHED levels.\n  - When a slot changes from 3s to another color, that level is COMPLETE.\n* Track remaining MOVES/ENERGY by counting tiles with value 15.\n* Track LIVES by counting distinct 2×2 blocks of 8s.\n\n# GENERAL NOTES\n* The grid is a bird’s-eye view.\n* If the grid does not change after an action, you likely attempted an illegal move into 4s.\n* Favor routes marked by 3s; use the generator (0/9 patch surrounded by 3s) to cycle keys; confirm the match by comparing the bottom-left indicator (boxed by 4s) to the 0/9 lock pattern found near 5s; then proceed to the exit.\n\n# EXAMPLE STRATEGY OBSERVATION\nThe 8×8 player (top rows 12s, bottom rows 9s) is touching 4s on the left, so LEFT is blocked. I see a 0/9 patch with only 3s around it to the right—that’s likely the generator. I should move RIGHT to step on/off it until the bottom-left indicator (boxed by 4s) matches the lock pattern I see near the 5s, then head to the exit.\n\n# TURN:\nCall exactly one action.\n\n"

Each value represents a different color and usually implies a different object.\n\nYou are playing a game called LockSmith.\n\n# CONTROLS\n* RESET: start over\n* ACTION1: move up\n* ACTION2: move down\n* ACTION3: move left\n* ACTION4: move right\n* ACTION5/ACTION6: no-ops\n\n# ORIENTATION (read carefully)\n* The global frame is fixed: the bottom-left KEY INDICATOR is always at the bottom-left; the EXIT/lock is elsewhere.\n* ACTION1 (UP) moves you toward the area where 15s (move counters) are located; use this as a compass for “up.”\n* ACTION4 (RIGHT) increases your distance from the bottom-left key indicator; ACTION3 (LEFT) decreases it.\n* Legality checks with 4s (walls):\n  - RIGHT is ILLEGAL if any 4s lie immediately to the right (“after” in row order) of any 12/9 cells of your 8×8 player.\n  - LEFT is ILLEGAL if any 4s lie immediately to the left (“before” in row order) of any 12/9 cells of your 8×8 player.\n  - UP is ILLEGAL if any 4s lie directly above the topmost 12 row of your player.\n  - DOWN is ILLEGAL if any 4s lie directly below the bottommost 9 row of your player.\n* Always orient carefully before moving: check where the 15s lie (for UP), how far you are from the bottom-left indicator (for LEFT/RIGHT), and whether 4s precede/follow your 12s/9s in the intended direction.\n\n# GOAL\nFind/generate a key that MATCHES the key pattern shown at the EXIT, then navigate to the EXIT to finish the level.\nThere are 6 levels total. Complete all levels to WIN.\n\n# TILE MEANINGS (important ones)\n* 0 = white cell (used in key patterns)\n* 3 = walkable path / corridor marker (often outlines routes to key/exit)\n* 4 = WALL (solid). You cannot enter 4s.\n* 5 = EXIT indicator (presence of 5s marks/frames the exit area)\n* 8 = LIFE token (count lives as the number of 2×2 blocks of 8s)\n* 9 = blue cells (used in player lower body; also appear elsewhere in the map and in key logic)\n* 12 = orange cells (used in player upper body)\n* 15 = MOVE counter (number of 15s ≈ moves/energy left)\n\n# PLAYER (sprite + movement legality)\n* The player is an 8×8 sprite made ONLY of 12s (top two rows) over 9s (bottom six rows).\n  - Concretely: rows 0–1 (relative to the sprite) are all 12s; rows 2–7 are all 9s.\n  - Other scattered 9s on the board are NOT the player—only the exact 8×8 (2×8 of 12s stacked on 6×8 of 9s) is the player.\n* Movement rules:\n  - You may move only through non-4 cells (i.e., never overlap a 4 after a move).\n  - If any part of your 8×8 sprite would overlap a 4 in the target direction (including cases where 4s lie “under” 9s), that move is ILLEGAL.\n  - If your sprite is already touching 4s on a side, you cannot move further in that touching direction until you have clearance.\n  - Practically: navigate corridors “between the 4s”.\n\n# KEYS, EXIT, AND HOW TO FIND THEM\n* Bottom-left KEY INDICATOR (non-interactive):\n  - A small block of 0s and 9s COMPLETELY BOXED by 4s in the bottom-left of the entire grid.\n  - This is NOT reachable and NOT a gameplay area. It only shows your CURRENT selected key.\n* EXIT (the lock to open):\n  - Elsewhere on the map, the lock is the target 0/9 pattern you must match, adjacent to some 5s (the 5s need not fully surround it).\n  - You may leave the level only when your current key EXACTLY matches this lock’s 0/9 distribution.\n* KEY GENERATOR (interactive, how to generate keys):\n  - Look for a patch consisting of 0s and 9s that has a CLEAR path of 3s leading to it and around it, and is NOT bordered by 5s or boxed by 4s.\n  - When any part of your 8×8 player steps ONTO this patch, it GENERATES a NEW candidate key and updates the bottom-left indicator.\n  - Step OFF the patch and then back ON to generate yet another candidate key; repeat to cycle through the set of keys.\n  - Continue cycling until the bottom-left indicator EXACTLY matches the lock pattern at the exit (the same 0/9 layout adjacent to 5s).\n* Locating things quickly:\n  - Generator: 0/9 patch accessible via 3s, with only 3s around it (no 5s), is almost certainly the generator.\n  - Exit: a matching 0/9 pattern near 5s marks the lock/exit area.\n\n# HUD / PROGRESSION\n* Visual score on the second-to-last grid row (row 62): it contains several 4-cell “slots”.\n  - Slots made of 3s represent UNFINISHED levels.\n  - When a slot changes from 3s to another color, that level is COMPLETE.\n* Track remaining MOVES/ENERGY by counting tiles with value 15.\n* Track LIVES by counting distinct 2×2 blocks of 8s.\n\n# GENERAL NOTES\n* The grid is a bird’s-eye view.\n* If the grid does not change after an action, you likely attempted an illegal move into 4s.\n* Favor routes marked by 3s; use the generator (0/9 patch surrounded by 3s) to cycle keys; confirm the match by comparing the bottom-left indicator (boxed by 4s) to the 0/9 lock pattern found near 5s; then proceed to the exit.\n\n# EXAMPLE STRATEGY OBSERVATION\nThe 8×8 player (top rows 12s, bottom rows 9s) is touching 4s on the left, so LEFT is blocked. I see a 0/9 patch with only 3s around it to the right—that’s likely the generator. I should move RIGHT to step on/off it until the bottom-left indicator (boxed by 4s) matches the lock pattern I see near the 5s, then head to the exit.\n\n# TURN:\nCall exactly one action.\n\n"

    "content": "\n# CONTEXT:\nYou are an agent playing a dynamic game. Your objective is to\nWIN and avoid GAME_OVER while minimizing actions.\n\nOne action produces one Frame. One Frame is made of one or more sequential\nGrids. Each Grid is a matrix size INT<0,63> by INT<0,63> filled with\nINT<0,15> values. Each value represents a different color and usually implies a different object.\n\nYou are playing a game called LockSmith.\n\n# CONTROLS\n* RESET: start over\n* ACTION1: move up\n* ACTION2: move down\n* ACTION3: move left\n* ACTION4: move right\n* ACTION5/ACTION6: no-ops\n\n# ORIENTATION (read carefully)\n* The global frame is fixed: the bottom-left KEY INDICATOR is always at the bottom-left; the EXIT/lock is elsewhere.\n* ACTION1 (UP) moves you toward the area where 15s (move counters) are located; use this as a compass for “up.”\n* ACTION4 (RIGHT) increases your distance from the bottom-left key indicator; ACTION3 (LEFT) decreases it.\n* Legality checks with 4s (walls):\n  - RIGHT is ILLEGAL if any 4s lie immediately to the right (“after” in row order) of any 12/9 cells of your 8×8 player.\n  - LEFT is ILLEGAL if any 4s lie immediately to the left (“before” in row order) of any 12/9 cells of your 8×8 player.\n  - UP is ILLEGAL if any 4s lie directly above the topmost 12 row of your player.\n  - DOWN is ILLEGAL if any 4s lie directly below the bottommost 9 row of your player.\n* Always orient carefully before moving: check where the 15s lie (for UP), how far you are from the bottom-left indicator (for LEFT/RIGHT), and whether 4s precede/follow your 12s/9s in the intended direction.\n\n# GOAL\nFind/generate a key that MATCHES the key pattern shown at the EXIT, then navigate to the EXIT to finish the level.\nThere are 6 levels total. Complete all levels to WIN.\n\n# TILE MEANINGS (important ones)\n* 0 = white cell (used in key patterns)\n* 3 = walkable path / corridor marker (often outlines routes to key/exit)\n* 4 = WALL (solid). You cannot enter 4s.\n* 5 = EXIT indicator (presence of 5s marks/frames the exit area)\n* 8 = LIFE token (count lives as the number of 2×2 blocks of 8s)\n* 9 = blue cells (used in player lower body; also appear elsewhere in the map and in key logic)\n* 12 = orange cells (used in player upper body)\n* 15 = MOVE counter (number of 15s ≈ moves/energy left)\n\n# PLAYER (sprite + movement legality)\n* The player is an 8×8 sprite made ONLY of 12s (top two rows) over 9s (bottom six rows).\n  - Concretely: rows 0–1 (relative to the sprite) are all 12s; rows 2–7 are all 9s.\n  - Other scattered 9s on the board are NOT the player—only the exact 8×8 (2×8 of 12s stacked on 6×8 of 9s) is the player.\n* Movement rules:\n  - You may move only through non-4 cells (i.e., never overlap a 4 after a move).\n  - If any part of your 8×8 sprite would overlap a 4 in the target direction (including cases where 4s lie “under” 9s), that move is ILLEGAL.\n  - If your sprite is already touching 4s on a side, you cannot move further in that touching direction until you have clearance.\n  - Practically: navigate corridors “between the 4s”.\n\n# KEYS, EXIT, AND HOW TO FIND THEM\n* Bottom-left KEY INDICATOR (non-interactive):\n  - A small block of 0s and 9s COMPLETELY BOXED by 4s in the bottom-left of the entire grid.\n  - This is NOT reachable and NOT a gameplay area. It only shows your CURRENT selected key.\n* EXIT (the lock to open):\n  - Elsewhere on the map, the lock is the target 0/9 pattern you must match, adjacent to some 5s (the 5s need not fully surround it).\n  - You may leave the level only when your current key EXACTLY matches this lock’s 0/9 distribution.\n* KEY GENERATOR (interactive, how to generate keys):\n  - Look for a patch consisting of 0s and 9s that has a CLEAR path of 3s leading to it and around it, and is NOT bordered by 5s or boxed by 4s.\n  - When any part of your 8×8 player steps ONTO this patch, it GENERATES a NEW candidate key and updates the bottom-left indicator.\n  - Step OFF the patch and then back ON to generate yet another candidate key; repeat to cycle through the set of keys.\n  - Continue cycling until the bottom-left indicator EXACTLY matches the lock pattern at the exit (the same 0/9 layout adjacent to 5s).\n* Locating things quickly:\n  - Generator: 0/9 patch accessible via 3s, with only 3s around it (no 5s), is almost certainly the generator.\n  - Exit: a matching 0/9 pattern near 5s marks the lock/exit area.\n\n# HUD / PROGRESSION\n* Visual score on the second-to-last grid row (row 62): it contains several 4-cell “slots”.\n  - Slots made of 3s represent UNFINISHED levels.\n  - When a slot changes from 3s to another color, that level is COMPLETE.\n* Track remaining MOVES/ENERGY by counting tiles with value 15.\n* Track LIVES by counting distinct 2×2 blocks of 8s.\n\n# GENERAL NOTES\n* The grid is a bird’s-eye view.\n* If the grid does not change after an action, you likely attempted an illegal move into 4s.\n* Favor routes marked by 3s; use the generator (0/9 patch surrounded by 3s) to cycle keys; confirm the match by comparing the bottom-left indicator (boxed by 4s) to the 0/9 lock pattern found near 5s; then proceed to the exit.\n\n# EXAMPLE STRATEGY OBSERVATION\nThe 8×8 player (top rows 12s, bottom rows 9s) is touching 4s on the left, so LEFT is blocked. I see a 0/9 patch with only 3s around it to the right—that’s likely the generator. I should move RIGHT to step on/off it until the bottom-left indicator (boxed by 4s) matches the lock pattern I see near the 5s, then head to the exit.\n\n# TURN:\nCall exactly one action.\n\n"

One Frame is made of one or more sequential\nGrids. Each Grid is a matrix size INT<0,63> by INT<0,63> filled with\nINT<0,15> values. Each value represents a different color and usually implies a different object.\n\nYou are playing a game called LockSmith.\n\n# CONTROLS\n* RESET: start over\n* ACTION1: move up\n* ACTION2: move down\n* ACTION3: move left\n* ACTION4: move right\n* ACTION5/ACTION6: no-ops\n\n# ORIENTATION (read carefully)\n* The global frame is fixed: the bottom-left KEY INDICATOR is always at the bottom-left; the EXIT/lock is elsewhere.\n* ACTION1 (UP) moves you toward the area where 15s (move counters) are located; use this as a compass for “up.”\n* ACTION4 (RIGHT) increases your distance from the bottom-left key indicator; ACTION3 (LEFT) decreases it.\n* Legality checks with 4s (walls):\n  - RIGHT is ILLEGAL if any 4s lie immediately to the right (“after” in row order) of any 12/9 cells of your 8×8 player.\n  - LEFT is ILLEGAL if any 4s lie immediately to the left (“before” in row order) of any 12/9 cells of your 8×8 player.\n  - UP is ILLEGAL if any 4s lie directly above the topmost 12 row of your player.\n  - DOWN is ILLEGAL if any 4s lie directly below the bottommost 9 row of your player.\n* Always orient carefully before moving: check where the 15s lie (for UP), how far you are from the bottom-left indicator (for LEFT/RIGHT), and whether 4s precede/follow your 12s/9s in the intended direction.\n\n# GOAL\nFind/generate a key that MATCHES the key pattern shown at the EXIT, then navigate to the EXIT to finish the level.\nThere are 6 levels total. Complete all levels to WIN.\n\n# TILE MEANINGS (important ones)\n* 0 = white cell (used in key patterns)\n* 3 = walkable path / corridor marker (often outlines routes to key/exit)\n* 4 = WALL (solid). You cannot enter 4s.\n* 5 = EXIT indicator (presence of 5s marks/frames the exit area)\n* 8 = LIFE token (count lives as the number of 2×2 blocks of 8s)\n* 9 = blue cells (used in player lower body; also appear elsewhere in the map and in key logic)\n* 12 = orange cells (used in player upper body)\n* 15 = MOVE counter (number of 15s ≈ moves/energy left)\n\n# PLAYER (sprite + movement legality)\n* The player is an 8×8 sprite made ONLY of 12s (top two rows) over 9s (bottom six rows).\n  - Concretely: rows 0–1 (relative to the sprite) are all 12s; rows 2–7 are all 9s.\n  - Other scattered 9s on the board are NOT the player—only the exact 8×8 (2×8 of 12s stacked on 6×8 of 9s) is the player.\n* Movement rules:\n  - You may move only through non-4 cells (i.e., never overlap a 4 after a move).\n  - If any part of your 8×8 sprite would overlap a 4 in the target direction (including cases where 4s lie “under” 9s), that move is ILLEGAL.\n  - If your sprite is already touching 4s on a side, you cannot move further in that touching direction until you have clearance.\n  - Practically: navigate corridors “between the 4s”.\n\n# KEYS, EXIT, AND HOW TO FIND THEM\n* Bottom-left KEY INDICATOR (non-interactive):\n  - A small block of 0s and 9s COMPLETELY BOXED by 4s in the bottom-left of the entire grid.\n  - This is NOT reachable and NOT a gameplay area. It only shows your CURRENT selected key.\n* EXIT (the lock to open):\n  - Elsewhere on the map, the lock is the target 0/9 pattern you must match, adjacent to some 5s (the 5s need not fully surround it).\n  - You may leave the level only when your current key EXACTLY matches this lock’s 0/9 distribution.\n* KEY GENERATOR (interactive, how to generate keys):\n  - Look for a patch consisting of 0s and 9s that has a CLEAR path of 3s leading to it and around it, and is NOT bordered by 5s or boxed by 4s.\n  - When any part of your 8×8 player steps ONTO this patch, it GENERATES a NEW candidate key and updates the bottom-left indicator.\n  - Step OFF the patch and then back ON to generate yet another candidate key; repeat to cycle through the set of keys.\n  - Continue cycling until the bottom-left indicator EXACTLY matches the lock pattern at the exit (the same 0/9 layout adjacent to 5s).\n* Locating things quickly:\n  - Generator: 0/9 patch accessible via 3s, with only 3s around it (no 5s), is almost certainly the generator.\n  - Exit: a matching 0/9 pattern near 5s marks the lock/exit area.\n\n# HUD / PROGRESSION\n* Visual score on the second-to-last grid row (row 62): it contains several 4-cell “slots”.\n  - Slots made of 3s represent UNFINISHED levels.\n  - When a slot changes from 3s to another color, that level is COMPLETE.\n* Track remaining MOVES/ENERGY by counting tiles with value 15.\n* Track LIVES by counting distinct 2×2 blocks of 8s.\n\n# GENERAL NOTES\n* The grid is a bird’s-eye view.\n* If the grid does not change after an action, you likely attempted an illegal move into 4s.\n* Favor routes marked by 3s; use the generator (0/9 patch surrounded by 3s) to cycle keys; confirm the match by comparing the bottom-left indicator (boxed by 4s) to the 0/9 lock pattern found near 5s; then proceed to the exit.\n\n# EXAMPLE STRATEGY OBSERVATION\nThe 8×8 player (top rows 12s, bottom rows 9s) is touching 4s on the left, so LEFT is blocked. I see a 0/9 patch with only 3s around it to the right—that’s likely the generator. I should move RIGHT to step on/off it until the bottom-left indicator (boxed by 4s) matches the lock pattern I see near the 5s, then head to the exit.\n\n# TURN:\nCall exactly one action.\n\n"

    "content": "\n# CONTEXT:\nYou are an agent playing a dynamic game. Your objective is to\nWIN and avoid GAME_OVER while minimizing actions.\n\nOne action produces one Frame. One Frame is made of one or more sequential\nGrids. Each Grid is a matrix size INT<0,63> by INT<0,63> filled with\nINT<0,15> values. Each value represents a different color and usually implies a different object.\n\nYou are playing a game called LockSmith.\n\n# CONTROLS\n* RESET: start over\n* ACTION1: move up\n* ACTION2: move down\n* ACTION3: move left\n* ACTION4: move right\n* ACTION5/ACTION6: no-ops\n\n# ORIENTATION (read carefully)\n* The global frame is fixed: the bottom-left KEY INDICATOR is always at the bottom-left; the EXIT/lock is elsewhere.\n* ACTION1 (UP) moves you toward the area where 15s (move counters) are located; use this as a compass for “up.”\n* ACTION4 (RIGHT) increases your distance from the bottom-left key indicator; ACTION3 (LEFT) decreases it.\n* Legality checks with 4s (walls):\n  - RIGHT is ILLEGAL if any 4s lie immediately to the right (“after” in row order) of any 12/9 cells of your 8×8 player.\n  - LEFT is ILLEGAL if any 4s lie immediately to the left (“before” in row order) of any 12/9 cells of your 8×8 player.\n  - UP is ILLEGAL if any 4s lie directly above the topmost 12 row of your player.\n  - DOWN is ILLEGAL if any 4s lie directly below the bottommost 9 row of your player.\n* Always orient carefully before moving: check where the 15s lie (for UP), how far you are from the bottom-left indicator (for LEFT/RIGHT), and whether 4s precede/follow your 12s/9s in the intended direction.\n\n# GOAL\nFind/generate a key that MATCHES the key pattern shown at the EXIT, then navigate to the EXIT to finish the level.\nThere are 6 levels total. Complete all levels to WIN.\n\n# TILE MEANINGS (important ones)\n* 0 = white cell (used in key patterns)\n* 3 = walkable path / corridor marker (often outlines routes to key/exit)\n* 4 = WALL (solid). You cannot enter 4s.\n* 5 = EXIT indicator (presence of 5s marks/frames the exit area)\n* 8 = LIFE token (count lives as the number of 2×2 blocks of 8s)\n* 9 = blue cells (used in player lower body; also appear elsewhere in the map and in key logic)\n* 12 = orange cells (used in player upper body)\n* 15 = MOVE counter (number of 15s ≈ moves/energy left)\n\n# PLAYER (sprite + movement legality)\n* The player is an 8×8 sprite made ONLY of 12s (top two rows) over 9s (bottom six rows).\n  - Concretely: rows 0–1 (relative to the sprite) are all 12s; rows 2–7 are all 9s.\n  - Other scattered 9s on the board are NOT the player—only the exact 8×8 (2×8 of 12s stacked on 6×8 of 9s) is the player.\n* Movement rules:\n  - You may move only through non-4 cells (i.e., never overlap a 4 after a move).\n  - If any part of your 8×8 sprite would overlap a 4 in the target direction (including cases where 4s lie “under” 9s), that move is ILLEGAL.\n  - If your sprite is already touching 4s on a side, you cannot move further in that touching direction until you have clearance.\n  - Practically: navigate corridors “between the 4s”.\n\n# KEYS, EXIT, AND HOW TO FIND THEM\n* Bottom-left KEY INDICATOR (non-interactive):\n  - A small block of 0s and 9s COMPLETELY BOXED by 4s in the bottom-left of the entire grid.\n  - This is NOT reachable and NOT a gameplay area. It only shows your CURRENT selected key.\n* EXIT (the lock to open):\n  - Elsewhere on the map, the lock is the target 0/9 pattern you must match, adjacent to some 5s (the 5s need not fully surround it).\n  - You may leave the level only when your current key EXACTLY matches this lock’s 0/9 distribution.\n* KEY GENERATOR (interactive, how to generate keys):\n  - Look for a patch consisting of 0s and 9s that has a CLEAR path of 3s leading to it and around it, and is NOT bordered by 5s or boxed by 4s.\n  - When any part of your 8×8 player steps ONTO this patch, it GENERATES a NEW candidate key and updates the bottom-left indicator.\n  - Step OFF the patch and then back ON to generate yet another candidate key; repeat to cycle through the set of keys.\n  - Continue cycling until the bottom-left indicator EXACTLY matches the lock pattern at the exit (the same 0/9 layout adjacent to 5s).\n* Locating things quickly:\n  - Generator: 0/9 patch accessible via 3s, with only 3s around it (no 5s), is almost certainly the generator.\n  - Exit: a matching 0/9 pattern near 5s marks the lock/exit area.\n\n# HUD / PROGRESSION\n* Visual score on the second-to-last grid row (row 62): it contains several 4-cell “slots”.\n  - Slots made of 3s represent UNFINISHED levels.\n  - When a slot changes from 3s to another color, that level is COMPLETE.\n* Track remaining MOVES/ENERGY by counting tiles with value 15.\n* Track LIVES by counting distinct 2×2 blocks of 8s.\n\n# GENERAL NOTES\n* The grid is a bird’s-eye view.\n* If the grid does not change after an action, you likely attempted an illegal move into 4s.\n* Favor routes marked by 3s; use the generator (0/9 patch surrounded by 3s) to cycle keys; confirm the match by comparing the bottom-left indicator (boxed by 4s) to the 0/9 lock pattern found near 5s; then proceed to the exit.\n\n# EXAMPLE STRATEGY OBSERVATION\nThe 8×8 player (top rows 12s, bottom rows 9s) is touching 4s on the left, so LEFT is blocked. I see a 0/9 patch with only 3s around it to the right—that’s likely the generator. I should move RIGHT to step on/off it until the bottom-left indicator (boxed by 4s) matches the lock pattern I see near the 5s, then head to the exit.\n\n# TURN:\nCall exactly one action.\n\n"

    "content": "\n# CONTEXT:\nYou are an agent playing a dynamic game. Your objective is to\nWIN and avoid GAME_OVER while minimizing actions.\n\nOne action produces one Frame. One Frame is made of one or more sequential\nGrids. Each Grid is a matrix size INT<0,63> by INT<0,63> filled with\nINT<0,15> values. Each value represents a different color and usually implies a different object.\n\nYou are playing a game called LockSmith.\n\n# CONTROLS\n* RESET: start over\n* ACTION1: move up\n* ACTION2: move down\n* ACTION3: move left\n* ACTION4: move right\n* ACTION5/ACTION6: no-ops\n\n# ORIENTATION (read carefully)\n* The global frame is fixed: the bottom-left KEY INDICATOR is always at the bottom-left; the EXIT/lock is elsewhere.\n* ACTION1 (UP) moves you toward the area where 15s (move counters) are located; use this as a compass for “up.”\n* ACTION4 (RIGHT) increases your distance from the bottom-left key indicator; ACTION3 (LEFT) decreases it.\n* Legality checks with 4s (walls):\n  - RIGHT is ILLEGAL if any 4s lie immediately to the right (“after” in row order) of any 12/9 cells of your 8×8 player.\n  - LEFT is ILLEGAL if any 4s lie immediately to the left (“before” in row order) of any 12/9 cells of your 8×8 player.\n  - UP is ILLEGAL if any 4s lie directly above the topmost 12 row of your player.\n  - DOWN is ILLEGAL if any 4s lie directly below the bottommost 9 row of your player.\n* Always orient carefully before moving: check where the 15s lie (for UP), how far you are from the bottom-left indicator (for LEFT/RIGHT), and whether 4s precede/follow your 12s/9s in the intended direction.\n\n# GOAL\nFind/generate a key that MATCHES the key pattern shown at the EXIT, then navigate to the EXIT to finish the level.\nThere are 6 levels total. Complete all levels to WIN.\n\n# TILE MEANINGS (important ones)\n* 0 = white cell (used in key patterns)\n* 3 = walkable path / corridor marker (often outlines routes to key/exit)\n* 4 = WALL (solid). You cannot enter 4s.\n* 5 = EXIT indicator (presence of 5s marks/frames the exit area)\n* 8 = LIFE token (count lives as the number of 2×2 blocks of 8s)\n* 9 = blue cells (used in player lower body; also appear elsewhere in the map and in key logic)\n* 12 = orange cells (used in player upper body)\n* 15 = MOVE counter (number of 15s ≈ moves/energy left)\n\n# PLAYER (sprite + movement legality)\n* The player is an 8×8 sprite made ONLY of 12s (top two rows) over 9s (bottom six rows).\n  - Concretely: rows 0–1 (relative to the sprite) are all 12s; rows 2–7 are all 9s.\n  - Other scattered 9s on the board are NOT the player—only the exact 8×8 (2×8 of 12s stacked on 6×8 of 9s) is the player.\n* Movement rules:\n  - You may move only through non-4 cells (i.e., never overlap a 4 after a move).\n  - If any part of your 8×8 sprite would overlap a 4 in the target direction (including cases where 4s lie “under” 9s), that move is ILLEGAL.\n  - If your sprite is already touching 4s on a side, you cannot move further in that touching direction until you have clearance.\n  - Practically: navigate corridors “between the 4s”.\n\n# KEYS, EXIT, AND HOW TO FIND THEM\n* Bottom-left KEY INDICATOR (non-interactive):\n  - A small block of 0s and 9s COMPLETELY BOXED by 4s in the bottom-left of the entire grid.\n  - This is NOT reachable and NOT a gameplay area. It only shows your CURRENT selected key.\n* EXIT (the lock to open):\n  - Elsewhere on the map, the lock is the target 0/9 pattern you must match, adjacent to some 5s (the 5s need not fully surround it).\n  - You may leave the level only when your current key EXACTLY matches this lock’s 0/9 distribution.\n* KEY GENERATOR (interactive, how to generate keys):\n  - Look for a patch consisting of 0s and 9s that has a CLEAR path of 3s leading to it and around it, and is NOT bordered by 5s or boxed by 4s.\n  - When any part of your 8×8 player steps ONTO this patch, it GENERATES a NEW candidate key and updates the bottom-left indicator.\n  - Step OFF the patch and then back ON to generate yet another candidate key; repeat to cycle through the set of keys.\n  - Continue cycling until the bottom-left indicator EXACTLY matches the lock pattern at the exit (the same 0/9 layout adjacent to 5s).\n* Locating things quickly:\n  - Generator: 0/9 patch accessible via 3s, with only 3s around it (no 5s), is almost certainly the generator.\n  - Exit: a matching 0/9 pattern near 5s marks the lock/exit area.\n\n# HUD / PROGRESSION\n* Visual score on the second-to-last grid row (row 62): it contains several 4-cell “slots”.\n  - Slots made of 3s represent UNFINISHED levels.\n  - When a slot changes from 3s to another color, that level is COMPLETE.\n* Track remaining MOVES/ENERGY by counting tiles with value 15.\n* Track LIVES by counting distinct 2×2 blocks of 8s.\n\n# GENERAL NOTES\n* The grid is a bird’s-eye view.\n* If the grid does not change after an action, you likely attempted an illegal move into 4s.\n* Favor routes marked by 3s; use the generator (0/9 patch surrounded by 3s) to cycle keys; confirm the match by comparing the bottom-left indicator (boxed by 4s) to the 0/9 lock pattern found near 5s; then proceed to the exit.\n\n# EXAMPLE STRATEGY OBSERVATION\nThe 8×8 player (top rows 12s, bottom rows 9s) is touching 4s on the left, so LEFT is blocked. I see a 0/9 patch with only 3s around it to the right—that’s likely the generator. I should move RIGHT to step on/off it until the bottom-left indicator (boxed by 4s) matches the lock pattern I see near the 5s, then head to the exit.\n\n# TURN:\nCall exactly one action.\n\n"

    "content": "\n# CONTEXT:\nYou are an agent playing a dynamic game. Your objective is to\nWIN and avoid GAME_OVER while minimizing actions.\n\nOne action produces one Frame. One Frame is made of one or more sequential\nGrids. Each Grid is a matrix size INT<0,63> by INT<0,63> filled with\nINT<0,15> values. Each value represents a different color and usually implies a different object.\n\nYou are playing a game called LockSmith.\n\n# CONTROLS\n* RESET: start over\n* ACTION1: move up\n* ACTION2: move down\n* ACTION3: move left\n* ACTION4: move right\n* ACTION5/ACTION6: no-ops\n\n# ORIENTATION (read carefully)\n* The global frame is fixed: the bottom-left KEY INDICATOR is always at the bottom-left; the EXIT/lock is elsewhere.\n* ACTION1 (UP) moves you toward the area where 15s (move counters) are located; use this as a compass for “up.”\n* ACTION4 (RIGHT) increases your distance from the bottom-left key indicator; ACTION3 (LEFT) decreases it.\n* Legality checks with 4s (walls):\n  - RIGHT is ILLEGAL if any 4s lie immediately to the right (“after” in row order) of any 12/9 cells of your 8×8 player.\n  - LEFT is ILLEGAL if any 4s lie immediately to the left (“before” in row order) of any 12/9 cells of your 8×8 player.\n  - UP is ILLEGAL if any 4s lie directly above the topmost 12 row of your player.\n  - DOWN is ILLEGAL if any 4s lie directly below the bottommost 9 row of your player.\n* Always orient carefully before moving: check where the 15s lie (for UP), how far you are from the bottom-left indicator (for LEFT/RIGHT), and whether 4s precede/follow your 12s/9s in the intended direction.\n\n# GOAL\nFind/generate a key that MATCHES the key pattern shown at the EXIT, then navigate to the EXIT to finish the level.\nThere are 6 levels total. Complete all levels to WIN.\n\n# TILE MEANINGS (important ones)\n* 0 = white cell (used in key patterns)\n* 3 = walkable path / corridor marker (often outlines routes to key/exit)\n* 4 = WALL (solid). You cannot enter 4s.\n* 5 = EXIT indicator (presence of 5s marks/frames the exit area)\n* 8 = LIFE token (count lives as the number of 2×2 blocks of 8s)\n* 9 = blue cells (used in player lower body; also appear elsewhere in the map and in key logic)\n* 12 = orange cells (used in player upper body)\n* 15 = MOVE counter (number of 15s ≈ moves/energy left)\n\n# PLAYER (sprite + movement legality)\n* The player is an 8×8 sprite made ONLY of 12s (top two rows) over 9s (bottom six rows).\n  - Concretely: rows 0–1 (relative to the sprite) are all 12s; rows 2–7 are all 9s.\n  - Other scattered 9s on the board are NOT the player—only the exact 8×8 (2×8 of 12s stacked on 6×8 of 9s) is the player.\n* Movement rules:\n  - You may move only through non-4 cells (i.e., never overlap a 4 after a move).\n  - If any part of your 8×8 sprite would overlap a 4 in the target direction (including cases where 4s lie “under” 9s), that move is ILLEGAL.\n  - If your sprite is already touching 4s on a side, you cannot move further in that touching direction until you have clearance.\n  - Practically: navigate corridors “between the 4s”.\n\n# KEYS, EXIT, AND HOW TO FIND THEM\n* Bottom-left KEY INDICATOR (non-interactive):\n  - A small block of 0s and 9s COMPLETELY BOXED by 4s in the bottom-left of the entire grid.\n  - This is NOT reachable and NOT a gameplay area. It only shows your CURRENT selected key.\n* EXIT (the lock to open):\n  - Elsewhere on the map, the lock is the target 0/9 pattern you must match, adjacent to some 5s (the 5s need not fully surround it).\n  - You may leave the level only when your current key EXACTLY matches this lock’s 0/9 distribution.\n* KEY GENERATOR (interactive, how to generate keys):\n  - Look for a patch consisting of 0s and 9s that has a CLEAR path of 3s leading to it and around it, and is NOT bordered by 5s or boxed by 4s.\n  - When any part of your 8×8 player steps ONTO this patch, it GENERATES a NEW candidate key and updates the bottom-left indicator.\n  - Step OFF the patch and then back ON to generate yet another candidate key; repeat to cycle through the set of keys.\n  - Continue cycling until the bottom-left indicator EXACTLY matches the lock pattern at the exit (the same 0/9 layout adjacent to 5s).\n* Locating things quickly:\n  - Generator: 0/9 patch accessible via 3s, with only 3s around it (no 5s), is almost certainly the generator.\n  - Exit: a matching 0/9 pattern near 5s marks the lock/exit area.\n\n# HUD / PROGRESSION\n* Visual score on the second-to-last grid row (row 62): it contains several 4-cell “slots”.\n  - Slots made of 3s represent UNFINISHED levels.\n  - When a slot changes from 3s to another color, that level is COMPLETE.\n* Track remaining MOVES/ENERGY by counting tiles with value 15.\n* Track LIVES by counting distinct 2×2 blocks of 8s.\n\n# GENERAL NOTES\n* The grid is a bird’s-eye view.\n* If the grid does not change after an action, you likely attempted an illegal move into 4s.\n* Favor routes marked by 3s; use the generator (0/9 patch surrounded by 3s) to cycle keys; confirm the match by comparing the bottom-left indicator (boxed by 4s) to the 0/9 lock pattern found near 5s; then proceed to the exit.\n\n# EXAMPLE STRATEGY OBSERVATION\nThe 8×8 player (top rows 12s, bottom rows 9s) is touching 4s on the left, so LEFT is blocked. I see a 0/9 patch with only 3s around it to the right—that’s likely the generator. I should move RIGHT to step on/off it until the bottom-left indicator (boxed by 4s) matches the lock pattern I see near the 5s, then head to the exit.\n\n# TURN:\nCall exactly one action.\n\n"

    "content": "\n# CONTEXT:\nYou are an agent playing a dynamic game. Your objective is to\nWIN and avoid GAME_OVER while minimizing actions.\n\nOne action produces one Frame. One Frame is made of one or more sequential\nGrids. Each Grid is a matrix size INT<0,63> by INT<0,63> filled with\nINT<0,15> values. Each value represents a different color and usually implies a different object.\n\nYou are playing a game called LockSmith.\n\n# CONTROLS\n* RESET: start over\n* ACTION1: move up\n* ACTION2: move down\n* ACTION3: move left\n* ACTION4: move right\n* ACTION5/ACTION6: no-ops\n\n# ORIENTATION (read carefully)\n* The global frame is fixed: the bottom-left KEY INDICATOR is always at the bottom-left; the EXIT/lock is elsewhere.\n* ACTION1 (UP) moves you toward the area where 15s (move counters) are located; use this as a compass for “up.”\n* ACTION4 (RIGHT) increases your distance from the bottom-left key indicator; ACTION3 (LEFT) decreases it.\n* Legality checks with 4s (walls):\n  - RIGHT is ILLEGAL if any 4s lie immediately to the right (“after” in row order) of any 12/9 cells of your 8×8 player.\n  - LEFT is ILLEGAL if any 4s lie immediately to the left (“before” in row order) of any 12/9 cells of your 8×8 player.\n  - UP is ILLEGAL if any 4s lie directly above the topmost 12 row of your player.\n  - DOWN is ILLEGAL if any 4s lie directly below the bottommost 9 row of your player.\n* Always orient carefully before moving: check where the 15s lie (for UP), how far you are from the bottom-left indicator (for LEFT/RIGHT), and whether 4s precede/follow your 12s/9s in the intended direction.\n\n# GOAL\nFind/generate a key that MATCHES the key pattern shown at the EXIT, then navigate to the EXIT to finish the level.\nThere are 6 levels total. Complete all levels to WIN.\n\n# TILE MEANINGS (important ones)\n* 0 = white cell (used in key patterns)\n* 3 = walkable path / corridor marker (often outlines routes to key/exit)\n* 4 = WALL (solid). You cannot enter 4s.\n* 5 = EXIT indicator (presence of 5s marks/frames the exit area)\n* 8 = LIFE token (count lives as the number of 2×2 blocks of 8s)\n* 9 = blue cells (used in player lower body; also appear elsewhere in the map and in key logic)\n* 12 = orange cells (used in player upper body)\n* 15 = MOVE counter (number of 15s ≈ moves/energy left)\n\n# PLAYER (sprite + movement legality)\n* The player is an 8×8 sprite made ONLY of 12s (top two rows) over 9s (bottom six rows).\n  - Concretely: rows 0–1 (relative to the sprite) are all 12s; rows 2–7 are all 9s.\n  - Other scattered 9s on the board are NOT the player—only the exact 8×8 (2×8 of 12s stacked on 6×8 of 9s) is the player.\n* Movement rules:\n  - You may move only through non-4 cells (i.e., never overlap a 4 after a move).\n  - If any part of your 8×8 sprite would overlap a 4 in the target direction (including cases where 4s lie “under” 9s), that move is ILLEGAL.\n  - If your sprite is already touching 4s on a side, you cannot move further in that touching direction until you have clearance.\n  - Practically: navigate corridors “between the 4s”.\n\n# KEYS, EXIT, AND HOW TO FIND THEM\n* Bottom-left KEY INDICATOR (non-interactive):\n  - A small block of 0s and 9s COMPLETELY BOXED by 4s in the bottom-left of the entire grid.\n  - This is NOT reachable and NOT a gameplay area. It only shows your CURRENT selected key.\n* EXIT (the lock to open):\n  - Elsewhere on the map, the lock is the target 0/9 pattern you must match, adjacent to some 5s (the 5s need not fully surround it).\n  - You may leave the level only when your current key EXACTLY matches this lock’s 0/9 distribution.\n* KEY GENERATOR (interactive, how to generate keys):\n  - Look for a patch consisting of 0s and 9s that has a CLEAR path of 3s leading to it and around it, and is NOT bordered by 5s or boxed by 4s.\n  - When any part of your 8×8 player steps ONTO this patch, it GENERATES a NEW candidate key and updates the bottom-left indicator.\n  - Step OFF the patch and then back ON to generate yet another candidate key; repeat to cycle through the set of keys.\n  - Continue cycling until the bottom-left indicator EXACTLY matches the lock pattern at the exit (the same 0/9 layout adjacent to 5s).\n* Locating things quickly:\n  - Generator: 0/9 patch accessible via 3s, with only 3s around it (no 5s), is almost certainly the generator.\n  - Exit: a matching 0/9 pattern near 5s marks the lock/exit area.\n\n# HUD / PROGRESSION\n* Visual score on the second-to-last grid row (row 62): it contains several 4-cell “slots”.\n  - Slots made of 3s represent UNFINISHED levels.\n  - When a slot changes from 3s to another color, that level is COMPLETE.\n* Track remaining MOVES/ENERGY by counting tiles with value 15.\n* Track LIVES by counting distinct 2×2 blocks of 8s.\n\n# GENERAL NOTES\n* The grid is a bird’s-eye view.\n* If the grid does not change after an action, you likely attempted an illegal move into 4s.\n* Favor routes marked by 3s; use the generator (0/9 patch surrounded by 3s) to cycle keys; confirm the match by comparing the bottom-left indicator (boxed by 4s) to the 0/9 lock pattern found near 5s; then proceed to the exit.\n\n# EXAMPLE STRATEGY OBSERVATION\nThe 8×8 player (top rows 12s, bottom rows 9s) is touching 4s on the left, so LEFT is blocked. I see a 0/9 patch with only 3s around it to the right—that’s likely the generator. I should move RIGHT to step on/off it until the bottom-left indicator (boxed by 4s) matches the lock pattern I see near the 5s, then head to the exit.\n\n# TURN:\nCall exactly one action.\n\n"

    "content": "\n# CONTEXT:\nYou are an agent playing a dynamic game. Your objective is to\nWIN and avoid GAME_OVER while minimizing actions.\n\nOne action produces one Frame. One Frame is made of one or more sequential\nGrids. Each Grid is a matrix size INT<0,63> by INT<0,63> filled with\nINT<0,15> values. Each value represents a different color and usually implies a different object.\n\nYou are playing a game called LockSmith.\n\n# CONTROLS\n* RESET: start over\n* ACTION1: move up\n* ACTION2: move down\n* ACTION3: move left\n* ACTION4: move right\n* ACTION5/ACTION6: no-ops\n\n# ORIENTATION (read carefully)\n* The global frame is fixed: the bottom-left KEY INDICATOR is always at the bottom-left; the EXIT/lock is elsewhere.\n* ACTION1 (UP) moves you toward the area where 15s (move counters) are located; use this as a compass for “up.”\n* ACTION4 (RIGHT) increases your distance from the bottom-left key indicator; ACTION3 (LEFT) decreases it.\n* Legality checks with 4s (walls):\n  - RIGHT is ILLEGAL if any 4s lie immediately to the right (“after” in row order) of any 12/9 cells of your 8×8 player.\n  - LEFT is ILLEGAL if any 4s lie immediately to the left (“before” in row order) of any 12/9 cells of your 8×8 player.\n  - UP is ILLEGAL if any 4s lie directly above the topmost 12 row of your player.\n  - DOWN is ILLEGAL if any 4s lie directly below the bottommost 9 row of your player.\n* Always orient carefully before moving: check where the 15s lie (for UP), how far you are from the bottom-left indicator (for LEFT/RIGHT), and whether 4s precede/follow your 12s/9s in the intended direction.\n\n# GOAL\nFind/generate a key that MATCHES the key pattern shown at the EXIT, then navigate to the EXIT to finish the level.\nThere are 6 levels total. Complete all levels to WIN.\n\n# TILE MEANINGS (important ones)\n* 0 = white cell (used in key patterns)\n* 3 = walkable path / corridor marker (often outlines routes to key/exit)\n* 4 = WALL (solid). You cannot enter 4s.\n* 5 = EXIT indicator (presence of 5s marks/frames the exit area)\n* 8 = LIFE token (count lives as the number of 2×2 blocks of 8s)\n* 9 = blue cells (used in player lower body; also appear elsewhere in the map and in key logic)\n* 12 = orange cells (used in player upper body)\n* 15 = MOVE counter (number of 15s ≈ moves/energy left)\n\n# PLAYER (sprite + movement legality)\n* The player is an 8×8 sprite made ONLY of 12s (top two rows) over 9s (bottom six rows).\n  - Concretely: rows 0–1 (relative to the sprite) are all 12s; rows 2–7 are all 9s.\n  - Other scattered 9s on the board are NOT the player—only the exact 8×8 (2×8 of 12s stacked on 6×8 of 9s) is the player.\n* Movement rules:\n  - You may move only through non-4 cells (i.e., never overlap a 4 after a move).\n  - If any part of your 8×8 sprite would overlap a 4 in the target direction (including cases where 4s lie “under” 9s), that move is ILLEGAL.\n  - If your sprite is already touching 4s on a side, you cannot move further in that touching direction until you have clearance.\n  - Practically: navigate corridors “between the 4s”.\n\n# KEYS, EXIT, AND HOW TO FIND THEM\n* Bottom-left KEY INDICATOR (non-interactive):\n  - A small block of 0s and 9s COMPLETELY BOXED by 4s in the bottom-left of the entire grid.\n  - This is NOT reachable and NOT a gameplay area. It only shows your CURRENT selected key.\n* EXIT (the lock to open):\n  - Elsewhere on the map, the lock is the target 0/9 pattern you must match, adjacent to some 5s (the 5s need not fully surround it).\n  - You may leave the level only when your current key EXACTLY matches this lock’s 0/9 distribution.\n* KEY GENERATOR (interactive, how to generate keys):\n  - Look for a patch consisting of 0s and 9s that has a CLEAR path of 3s leading to it and around it, and is NOT bordered by 5s or boxed by 4s.\n  - When any part of your 8×8 player steps ONTO this patch, it GENERATES a NEW candidate key and updates the bottom-left indicator.\n  - Step OFF the patch and then back ON to generate yet another candidate key; repeat to cycle through the set of keys.\n  - Continue cycling until the bottom-left indicator EXACTLY matches the lock pattern at the exit (the same 0/9 layout adjacent to 5s).\n* Locating things quickly:\n  - Generator: 0/9 patch accessible via 3s, with only 3s around it (no 5s), is almost certainly the generator.\n  - Exit: a matching 0/9 pattern near 5s marks the lock/exit area.\n\n# HUD / PROGRESSION\n* Visual score on the second-to-last grid row (row 62): it contains several 4-cell “slots”.\n  - Slots made of 3s represent UNFINISHED levels.\n  - When a slot changes from 3s to another color, that level is COMPLETE.\n* Track remaining MOVES/ENERGY by counting tiles with value 15.\n* Track LIVES by counting distinct 2×2 blocks of 8s.\n\n# GENERAL NOTES\n* The grid is a bird’s-eye view.\n* If the grid does not change after an action, you likely attempted an illegal move into 4s.\n* Favor routes marked by 3s; use the generator (0/9 patch surrounded by 3s) to cycle keys; confirm the match by comparing the bottom-left indicator (boxed by 4s) to the 0/9 lock pattern found near 5s; then proceed to the exit.\n\n# EXAMPLE STRATEGY OBSERVATION\nThe 8×8 player (top rows 12s, bottom rows 9s) is touching 4s on the left, so LEFT is blocked. I see a 0/9 patch with only 3s around it to the right—that’s likely the generator. I should move RIGHT to step on/off it until the bottom-left indicator (boxed by 4s) matches the lock pattern I see near the 5s, then head to the exit.\n\n# TURN:\nCall exactly one action.\n\n"

    "content": "\n# CONTEXT:\nYou are an agent playing a dynamic game. Your objective is to\nWIN and avoid GAME_OVER while minimizing actions.\n\nOne action produces one Frame. One Frame is made of one or more sequential\nGrids. Each Grid is a matrix size INT<0,63> by INT<0,63> filled with\nINT<0,15> values. Each value represents a different color and usually implies a different object.\n\nYou are playing a game called LockSmith.\n\n# CONTROLS\n* RESET: start over\n* ACTION1: move up\n* ACTION2: move down\n* ACTION3: move left\n* ACTION4: move right\n* ACTION5/ACTION6: no-ops\n\n# ORIENTATION (read carefully)\n* The global frame is fixed: the bottom-left KEY INDICATOR is always at the bottom-left; the EXIT/lock is elsewhere.\n* ACTION1 (UP) moves you toward the area where 15s (move counters) are located; use this as a compass for “up.”\n* ACTION4 (RIGHT) increases your distance from the bottom-left key indicator; ACTION3 (LEFT) decreases it.\n* Legality checks with 4s (walls):\n  - RIGHT is ILLEGAL if any 4s lie immediately to the right (“after” in row order) of any 12/9 cells of your 8×8 player.\n  - LEFT is ILLEGAL if any 4s lie immediately to the left (“before” in row order) of any 12/9 cells of your 8×8 player.\n  - UP is ILLEGAL if any 4s lie directly above the topmost 12 row of your player.\n  - DOWN is ILLEGAL if any 4s lie directly below the bottommost 9 row of your player.\n* Always orient carefully before moving: check where the 15s lie (for UP), how far you are from the bottom-left indicator (for LEFT/RIGHT), and whether 4s precede/follow your 12s/9s in the intended direction.\n\n# GOAL\nFind/generate a key that MATCHES the key pattern shown at the EXIT, then navigate to the EXIT to finish the level.\nThere are 6 levels total. Complete all levels to WIN.\n\n# TILE MEANINGS (important ones)\n* 0 = white cell (used in key patterns)\n* 3 = walkable path / corridor marker (often outlines routes to key/exit)\n* 4 = WALL (solid). You cannot enter 4s.\n* 5 = EXIT indicator (presence of 5s marks/frames the exit area)\n* 8 = LIFE token (count lives as the number of 2×2 blocks of 8s)\n* 9 = blue cells (used in player lower body; also appear elsewhere in the map and in key logic)\n* 12 = orange cells (used in player upper body)\n* 15 = MOVE counter (number of 15s ≈ moves/energy left)\n\n# PLAYER (sprite + movement legality)\n* The player is an 8×8 sprite made ONLY of 12s (top two rows) over 9s (bottom six rows).\n  - Concretely: rows 0–1 (relative to the sprite) are all 12s; rows 2–7 are all 9s.\n  - Other scattered 9s on the board are NOT the player—only the exact 8×8 (2×8 of 12s stacked on 6×8 of 9s) is the player.\n* Movement rules:\n  - You may move only through non-4 cells (i.e., never overlap a 4 after a move).\n  - If any part of your 8×8 sprite would overlap a 4 in the target direction (including cases where 4s lie “under” 9s), that move is ILLEGAL.\n  - If your sprite is already touching 4s on a side, you cannot move further in that touching direction until you have clearance.\n  - Practically: navigate corridors “between the 4s”.\n\n# KEYS, EXIT, AND HOW TO FIND THEM\n* Bottom-left KEY INDICATOR (non-interactive):\n  - A small block of 0s and 9s COMPLETELY BOXED by 4s in the bottom-left of the entire grid.\n  - This is NOT reachable and NOT a gameplay area. It only shows your CURRENT selected key.\n* EXIT (the lock to open):\n  - Elsewhere on the map, the lock is the target 0/9 pattern you must match, adjacent to some 5s (the 5s need not fully surround it).\n  - You may leave the level only when your current key EXACTLY matches this lock’s 0/9 distribution.\n* KEY GENERATOR (interactive, how to generate keys):\n  - Look for a patch consisting of 0s and 9s that has a CLEAR path of 3s leading to it and around it, and is NOT bordered by 5s or boxed by 4s.\n  - When any part of your 8×8 player steps ONTO this patch, it GENERATES a NEW candidate key and updates the bottom-left indicator.\n  - Step OFF the patch and then back ON to generate yet another candidate key; repeat to cycle through the set of keys.\n  - Continue cycling until the bottom-left indicator EXACTLY matches the lock pattern at the exit (the same 0/9 layout adjacent to 5s).\n* Locating things quickly:\n  - Generator: 0/9 patch accessible via 3s, with only 3s around it (no 5s), is almost certainly the generator.\n  - Exit: a matching 0/9 pattern near 5s marks the lock/exit area.\n\n# HUD / PROGRESSION\n* Visual score on the second-to-last grid row (row 62): it contains several 4-cell “slots”.\n  - Slots made of 3s represent UNFINISHED levels.\n  - When a slot changes from 3s to another color, that level is COMPLETE.\n* Track remaining MOVES/ENERGY by counting tiles with value 15.\n* Track LIVES by counting distinct 2×2 blocks of 8s.\n\n# GENERAL NOTES\n* The grid is a bird’s-eye view.\n* If the grid does not change after an action, you likely attempted an illegal move into 4s.\n* Favor routes marked by 3s; use the generator (0/9 patch surrounded by 3s) to cycle keys; confirm the match by comparing the bottom-left indicator (boxed by 4s) to the 0/9 lock pattern found near 5s; then proceed to the exit.\n\n# EXAMPLE STRATEGY OBSERVATION\nThe 8×8 player (top rows 12s, bottom rows 9s) is touching 4s on the left, so LEFT is blocked. I see a 0/9 patch with only 3s around it to the right—that’s likely the generator. I should move RIGHT to step on/off it until the bottom-left indicator (boxed by 4s) matches the lock pattern I see near the 5s, then head to the exit.\n\n# TURN:\nCall exactly one action.\n\n"

    "content": "\n# CONTEXT:\nYou are an agent playing a dynamic game. Your objective is to\nWIN and avoid GAME_OVER while minimizing actions.\n\nOne action produces one Frame. One Frame is made of one or more sequential\nGrids. Each Grid is a matrix size INT<0,63> by INT<0,63> filled with\nINT<0,15> values. Each value represents a different color and usually implies a different object.\n\nYou are playing a game called LockSmith.\n\n# CONTROLS\n* RESET: start over\n* ACTION1: move up\n* ACTION2: move down\n* ACTION3: move left\n* ACTION4: move right\n* ACTION5/ACTION6: no-ops\n\n# ORIENTATION (read carefully)\n* The global frame is fixed: the bottom-left KEY INDICATOR is always at the bottom-left; the EXIT/lock is elsewhere.\n* ACTION1 (UP) moves you toward the area where 15s (move counters) are located; use this as a compass for “up.”\n* ACTION4 (RIGHT) increases your distance from the bottom-left key indicator; ACTION3 (LEFT) decreases it.\n* Legality checks with 4s (walls):\n  - RIGHT is ILLEGAL if any 4s lie immediately to the right (“after” in row order) of any 12/9 cells of your 8×8 player.\n  - LEFT is ILLEGAL if any 4s lie immediately to the left (“before” in row order) of any 12/9 cells of your 8×8 player.\n  - UP is ILLEGAL if any 4s lie directly above the topmost 12 row of your player.\n  - DOWN is ILLEGAL if any 4s lie directly below the bottommost 9 row of your player.\n* Always orient carefully before moving: check where the 15s lie (for UP), how far you are from the bottom-left indicator (for LEFT/RIGHT), and whether 4s precede/follow your 12s/9s in the intended direction.\n\n# GOAL\nFind/generate a key that MATCHES the key pattern shown at the EXIT, then navigate to the EXIT to finish the level.\nThere are 6 levels total. Complete all levels to WIN.\n\n# TILE MEANINGS (important ones)\n* 0 = white cell (used in key patterns)\n* 3 = walkable path / corridor marker (often outlines routes to key/exit)\n* 4 = WALL (solid). You cannot enter 4s.\n* 5 = EXIT indicator (presence of 5s marks/frames the exit area)\n* 8 = LIFE token (count lives as the number of 2×2 blocks of 8s)\n* 9 = blue cells (used in player lower body; also appear elsewhere in the map and in key logic)\n* 12 = orange cells (used in player upper body)\n* 15 = MOVE counter (number of 15s ≈ moves/energy left)\n\n# PLAYER (sprite + movement legality)\n* The player is an 8×8 sprite made ONLY of 12s (top two rows) over 9s (bottom six rows).\n  - Concretely: rows 0–1 (relative to the sprite) are all 12s; rows 2–7 are all 9s.\n  - Other scattered 9s on the board are NOT the player—only the exact 8×8 (2×8 of 12s stacked on 6×8 of 9s) is the player.\n* Movement rules:\n  - You may move only through non-4 cells (i.e., never overlap a 4 after a move).\n  - If any part of your 8×8 sprite would overlap a 4 in the target direction (including cases where 4s lie “under” 9s), that move is ILLEGAL.\n  - If your sprite is already touching 4s on a side, you cannot move further in that touching direction until you have clearance.\n  - Practically: navigate corridors “between the 4s”.\n\n# KEYS, EXIT, AND HOW TO FIND THEM\n* Bottom-left KEY INDICATOR (non-interactive):\n  - A small block of 0s and 9s COMPLETELY BOXED by 4s in the bottom-left of the entire grid.\n  - This is NOT reachable and NOT a gameplay area. It only shows your CURRENT selected key.\n* EXIT (the lock to open):\n  - Elsewhere on the map, the lock is the target 0/9 pattern you must match, adjacent to some 5s (the 5s need not fully surround it).\n  - You may leave the level only when your current key EXACTLY matches this lock’s 0/9 distribution.\n* KEY GENERATOR (interactive, how to generate keys):\n  - Look for a patch consisting of 0s and 9s that has a CLEAR path of 3s leading to it and around it, and is NOT bordered by 5s or boxed by 4s.\n  - When any part of your 8×8 player steps ONTO this patch, it GENERATES a NEW candidate key and updates the bottom-left indicator.\n  - Step OFF the patch and then back ON to generate yet another candidate key; repeat to cycle through the set of keys.\n  - Continue cycling until the bottom-left indicator EXACTLY matches the lock pattern at the exit (the same 0/9 layout adjacent to 5s).\n* Locating things quickly:\n  - Generator: 0/9 patch accessible via 3s, with only 3s around it (no 5s), is almost certainly the generator.\n  - Exit: a matching 0/9 pattern near 5s marks the lock/exit area.\n\n# HUD / PROGRESSION\n* Visual score on the second-to-last grid row (row 62): it contains several 4-cell “slots”.\n  - Slots made of 3s represent UNFINISHED levels.\n  - When a slot changes from 3s to another color, that level is COMPLETE.\n* Track remaining MOVES/ENERGY by counting tiles with value 15.\n* Track LIVES by counting distinct 2×2 blocks of 8s.\n\n# GENERAL NOTES\n* The grid is a bird’s-eye view.\n* If the grid does not change after an action, you likely attempted an illegal move into 4s.\n* Favor routes marked by 3s; use the generator (0/9 patch surrounded by 3s) to cycle keys; confirm the match by comparing the bottom-left indicator (boxed by 4s) to the 0/9 lock pattern found near 5s; then proceed to the exit.\n\n# EXAMPLE STRATEGY OBSERVATION\nThe 8×8 player (top rows 12s, bottom rows 9s) is touching 4s on the left, so LEFT is blocked. I see a 0/9 patch with only 3s around it to the right—that’s likely the generator. I should move RIGHT to step on/off it until the bottom-left indicator (boxed by 4s) matches the lock pattern I see near the 5s, then head to the exit.\n\n# TURN:\nCall exactly one action.\n\n"

    "content": "\n# CONTEXT:\nYou are an agent playing a dynamic game. Your objective is to\nWIN and avoid GAME_OVER while minimizing actions.\n\nOne action produces one Frame. One Frame is made of one or more sequential\nGrids. Each Grid is a matrix size INT<0,63> by INT<0,63> filled with\nINT<0,15> values. Each value represents a different color and usually implies a different object.\n\nYou are playing a game called LockSmith.\n\n# CONTROLS\n* RESET: start over\n* ACTION1: move up\n* ACTION2: move down\n* ACTION3: move left\n* ACTION4: move right\n* ACTION5/ACTION6: no-ops\n\n# ORIENTATION (read carefully)\n* The global frame is fixed: the bottom-left KEY INDICATOR is always at the bottom-left; the EXIT/lock is elsewhere.\n* ACTION1 (UP) moves you toward the area where 15s (move counters) are located; use this as a compass for “up.”\n* ACTION4 (RIGHT) increases your distance from the bottom-left key indicator; ACTION3 (LEFT) decreases it.\n* Legality checks with 4s (walls):\n  - RIGHT is ILLEGAL if any 4s lie immediately to the right (“after” in row order) of any 12/9 cells of your 8×8 player.\n  - LEFT is ILLEGAL if any 4s lie immediately to the left (“before” in row order) of any 12/9 cells of your 8×8 player.\n  - UP is ILLEGAL if any 4s lie directly above the topmost 12 row of your player.\n  - DOWN is ILLEGAL if any 4s lie directly below the bottommost 9 row of your player.\n* Always orient carefully before moving: check where the 15s lie (for UP), how far you are from the bottom-left indicator (for LEFT/RIGHT), and whether 4s precede/follow your 12s/9s in the intended direction.\n\n# GOAL\nFind/generate a key that MATCHES the key pattern shown at the EXIT, then navigate to the EXIT to finish the level.\nThere are 6 levels total. Complete all levels to WIN.\n\n# TILE MEANINGS (important ones)\n* 0 = white cell (used in key patterns)\n* 3 = walkable path / corridor marker (often outlines routes to key/exit)\n* 4 = WALL (solid). You cannot enter 4s.\n* 5 = EXIT indicator (presence of 5s marks/frames the exit area)\n* 8 = LIFE token (count lives as the number of 2×2 blocks of 8s)\n* 9 = blue cells (used in player lower body; also appear elsewhere in the map and in key logic)\n* 12 = orange cells (used in player upper body)\n* 15 = MOVE counter (number of 15s ≈ moves/energy left)\n\n# PLAYER (sprite + movement legality)\n* The player is an 8×8 sprite made ONLY of 12s (top two rows) over 9s (bottom six rows).\n  - Concretely: rows 0–1 (relative to the sprite) are all 12s; rows 2–7 are all 9s.\n  - Other scattered 9s on the board are NOT the player—only the exact 8×8 (2×8 of 12s stacked on 6×8 of 9s) is the player.\n* Movement rules:\n  - You may move only through non-4 cells (i.e., never overlap a 4 after a move).\n  - If any part of your 8×8 sprite would overlap a 4 in the target direction (including cases where 4s lie “under” 9s), that move is ILLEGAL.\n  - If your sprite is already touching 4s on a side, you cannot move further in that touching direction until you have clearance.\n  - Practically: navigate corridors “between the 4s”.\n\n# KEYS, EXIT, AND HOW TO FIND THEM\n* Bottom-left KEY INDICATOR (non-interactive):\n  - A small block of 0s and 9s COMPLETELY BOXED by 4s in the bottom-left of the entire grid.\n  - This is NOT reachable and NOT a gameplay area. It only shows your CURRENT selected key.\n* EXIT (the lock to open):\n  - Elsewhere on the map, the lock is the target 0/9 pattern you must match, adjacent to some 5s (the 5s need not fully surround it).\n  - You may leave the level only when your current key EXACTLY matches this lock’s 0/9 distribution.\n* KEY GENERATOR (interactive, how to generate keys):\n  - Look for a patch consisting of 0s and 9s that has a CLEAR path of 3s leading to it and around it, and is NOT bordered by 5s or boxed by 4s.\n  - When any part of your 8×8 player steps ONTO this patch, it GENERATES a NEW candidate key and updates the bottom-left indicator.\n  - Step OFF the patch and then back ON to generate yet another candidate key; repeat to cycle through the set of keys.\n  - Continue cycling until the bottom-left indicator EXACTLY matches the lock pattern at the exit (the same 0/9 layout adjacent to 5s).\n* Locating things quickly:\n  - Generator: 0/9 patch accessible via 3s, with only 3s around it (no 5s), is almost certainly the generator.\n  - Exit: a matching 0/9 pattern near 5s marks the lock/exit area.\n\n# HUD / PROGRESSION\n* Visual score on the second-to-last grid row (row 62): it contains several 4-cell “slots”.\n  - Slots made of 3s represent UNFINISHED levels.\n  - When a slot changes from 3s to another color, that level is COMPLETE.\n* Track remaining MOVES/ENERGY by counting tiles with value 15.\n* Track LIVES by counting distinct 2×2 blocks of 8s.\n\n# GENERAL NOTES\n* The grid is a bird’s-eye view.\n* If the grid does not change after an action, you likely attempted an illegal move into 4s.\n* Favor routes marked by 3s; use the generator (0/9 patch surrounded by 3s) to cycle keys; confirm the match by comparing the bottom-left indicator (boxed by 4s) to the 0/9 lock pattern found near 5s; then proceed to the exit.\n\n# EXAMPLE STRATEGY OBSERVATION\nThe 8×8 player (top rows 12s, bottom rows 9s) is touching 4s on the left, so LEFT is blocked. I see a 0/9 patch with only 3s around it to the right—that’s likely the generator. I should move RIGHT to step on/off it until the bottom-left indicator (boxed by 4s) matches the lock pattern I see near the 5s, then head to the exit.\n\n# TURN:\nCall exactly one action.\n\n"

    "content": "\n# CONTEXT:\nYou are an agent playing a dynamic game. Your objective is to\nWIN and avoid GAME_OVER while minimizing actions.\n\nOne action produces one Frame. One Frame is made of one or more sequential\nGrids. Each Grid is a matrix size INT<0,63> by INT<0,63> filled with\nINT<0,15> values. Each value represents a different color and usually implies a different object.\n\nYou are playing a game called LockSmith.\n\n# CONTROLS\n* RESET: start over\n* ACTION1: move up\n* ACTION2: move down\n* ACTION3: move left\n* ACTION4: move right\n* ACTION5/ACTION6: no-ops\n\n# ORIENTATION (read carefully)\n* The global frame is fixed: the bottom-left KEY INDICATOR is always at the bottom-left; the EXIT/lock is elsewhere.\n* ACTION1 (UP) moves you toward the area where 15s (move counters) are located; use this as a compass for “up.”\n* ACTION4 (RIGHT) increases your distance from the bottom-left key indicator; ACTION3 (LEFT) decreases it.\n* Legality checks with 4s (walls):\n  - RIGHT is ILLEGAL if any 4s lie immediately to the right (“after” in row order) of any 12/9 cells of your 8×8 player.\n  - LEFT is ILLEGAL if any 4s lie immediately to the left (“before” in row order) of any 12/9 cells of your 8×8 player.\n  - UP is ILLEGAL if any 4s lie directly above the topmost 12 row of your player.\n  - DOWN is ILLEGAL if any 4s lie directly below the bottommost 9 row of your player.\n* Always orient carefully before moving: check where the 15s lie (for UP), how far you are from the bottom-left indicator (for LEFT/RIGHT), and whether 4s precede/follow your 12s/9s in the intended direction.\n\n# GOAL\nFind/generate a key that MATCHES the key pattern shown at the EXIT, then navigate to the EXIT to finish the level.\nThere are 6 levels total. Complete all levels to WIN.\n\n# TILE MEANINGS (important ones)\n* 0 = white cell (used in key patterns)\n* 3 = walkable path / corridor marker (often outlines routes to key/exit)\n* 4 = WALL (solid). You cannot enter 4s.\n* 5 = EXIT indicator (presence of 5s marks/frames the exit area)\n* 8 = LIFE token (count lives as the number of 2×2 blocks of 8s)\n* 9 = blue cells (used in player lower body; also appear elsewhere in the map and in key logic)\n* 12 = orange cells (used in player upper body)\n* 15 = MOVE counter (number of 15s ≈ moves/energy left)\n\n# PLAYER (sprite + movement legality)\n* The player is an 8×8 sprite made ONLY of 12s (top two rows) over 9s (bottom six rows).\n  - Concretely: rows 0–1 (relative to the sprite) are all 12s; rows 2–7 are all 9s.\n  - Other scattered 9s on the board are NOT the player—only the exact 8×8 (2×8 of 12s stacked on 6×8 of 9s) is the player.\n* Movement rules:\n  - You may move only through non-4 cells (i.e., never overlap a 4 after a move).\n  - If any part of your 8×8 sprite would overlap a 4 in the target direction (including cases where 4s lie “under” 9s), that move is ILLEGAL.\n  - If your sprite is already touching 4s on a side, you cannot move further in that touching direction until you have clearance.\n  - Practically: navigate corridors “between the 4s”.\n\n# KEYS, EXIT, AND HOW TO FIND THEM\n* Bottom-left KEY INDICATOR (non-interactive):\n  - A small block of 0s and 9s COMPLETELY BOXED by 4s in the bottom-left of the entire grid.\n  - This is NOT reachable and NOT a gameplay area. It only shows your CURRENT selected key.\n* EXIT (the lock to open):\n  - Elsewhere on the map, the lock is the target 0/9 pattern you must match, adjacent to some 5s (the 5s need not fully surround it).\n  - You may leave the level only when your current key EXACTLY matches this lock’s 0/9 distribution.\n* KEY GENERATOR (interactive, how to generate keys):\n  - Look for a patch consisting of 0s and 9s that has a CLEAR path of 3s leading to it and around it, and is NOT bordered by 5s or boxed by 4s.\n  - When any part of your 8×8 player steps ONTO this patch, it GENERATES a NEW candidate key and updates the bottom-left indicator.\n  - Step OFF the patch and then back ON to generate yet another candidate key; repeat to cycle through the set of keys.\n  - Continue cycling until the bottom-left indicator EXACTLY matches the lock pattern at the exit (the same 0/9 layout adjacent to 5s).\n* Locating things quickly:\n  - Generator: 0/9 patch accessible via 3s, with only 3s around it (no 5s), is almost certainly the generator.\n  - Exit: a matching 0/9 pattern near 5s marks the lock/exit area.\n\n# HUD / PROGRESSION\n* Visual score on the second-to-last grid row (row 62): it contains several 4-cell “slots”.\n  - Slots made of 3s represent UNFINISHED levels.\n  - When a slot changes from 3s to another color, that level is COMPLETE.\n* Track remaining MOVES/ENERGY by counting tiles with value 15.\n* Track LIVES by counting distinct 2×2 blocks of 8s.\n\n# GENERAL NOTES\n* The grid is a bird’s-eye view.\n* If the grid does not change after an action, you likely attempted an illegal move into 4s.\n* Favor routes marked by 3s; use the generator (0/9 patch surrounded by 3s) to cycle keys; confirm the match by comparing the bottom-left indicator (boxed by 4s) to the 0/9 lock pattern found near 5s; then proceed to the exit.\n\n# EXAMPLE STRATEGY OBSERVATION\nThe 8×8 player (top rows 12s, bottom rows 9s) is touching 4s on the left, so LEFT is blocked. I see a 0/9 patch with only 3s around it to the right—that’s likely the generator. I should move RIGHT to step on/off it until the bottom-left indicator (boxed by 4s) matches the lock pattern I see near the 5s, then head to the exit.\n\n# TURN:\nCall exactly one action.\n\n"

    "content": "\n# CONTEXT:\nYou are an agent playing a dynamic game. Your objective is to\nWIN and avoid GAME_OVER while minimizing actions.\n\nOne action produces one Frame. One Frame is made of one or more sequential\nGrids. Each Grid is a matrix size INT<0,63> by INT<0,63> filled with\nINT<0,15> values. Each value represents a different color and usually implies a different object.\n\nYou are playing a game called LockSmith.\n\n# CONTROLS\n* RESET: start over\n* ACTION1: move up\n* ACTION2: move down\n* ACTION3: move left\n* ACTION4: move right\n* ACTION5/ACTION6: no-ops\n\n# ORIENTATION (read carefully)\n* The global frame is fixed: the bottom-left KEY INDICATOR is always at the bottom-left; the EXIT/lock is elsewhere.\n* ACTION1 (UP) moves you toward the area where 15s (move counters) are located; use this as a compass for “up.”\n* ACTION4 (RIGHT) increases your distance from the bottom-left key indicator; ACTION3 (LEFT) decreases it.\n* Legality checks with 4s (walls):\n  - RIGHT is ILLEGAL if any 4s lie immediately to the right (“after” in row order) of any 12/9 cells of your 8×8 player.\n  - LEFT is ILLEGAL if any 4s lie immediately to the left (“before” in row order) of any 12/9 cells of your 8×8 player.\n  - UP is ILLEGAL if any 4s lie directly above the topmost 12 row of your player.\n  - DOWN is ILLEGAL if any 4s lie directly below the bottommost 9 row of your player.\n* Always orient carefully before moving: check where the 15s lie (for UP), how far you are from the bottom-left indicator (for LEFT/RIGHT), and whether 4s precede/follow your 12s/9s in the intended direction.\n\n# GOAL\nFind/generate a key that MATCHES the key pattern shown at the EXIT, then navigate to the EXIT to finish the level.\nThere are 6 levels total. Complete all levels to WIN.\n\n# TILE MEANINGS (important ones)\n* 0 = white cell (used in key patterns)\n* 3 = walkable path / corridor marker (often outlines routes to key/exit)\n* 4 = WALL (solid). You cannot enter 4s.\n* 5 = EXIT indicator (presence of 5s marks/frames the exit area)\n* 8 = LIFE token (count lives as the number of 2×2 blocks of 8s)\n* 9 = blue cells (used in player lower body; also appear elsewhere in the map and in key logic)\n* 12 = orange cells (used in player upper body)\n* 15 = MOVE counter (number of 15s ≈ moves/energy left)\n\n# PLAYER (sprite + movement legality)\n* The player is an 8×8 sprite made ONLY of 12s (top two rows) over 9s (bottom six rows).\n  - Concretely: rows 0–1 (relative to the sprite) are all 12s; rows 2–7 are all 9s.\n  - Other scattered 9s on the board are NOT the player—only the exact 8×8 (2×8 of 12s stacked on 6×8 of 9s) is the player.\n* Movement rules:\n  - You may move only through non-4 cells (i.e., never overlap a 4 after a move).\n  - If any part of your 8×8 sprite would overlap a 4 in the target direction (including cases where 4s lie “under” 9s), that move is ILLEGAL.\n  - If your sprite is already touching 4s on a side, you cannot move further in that touching direction until you have clearance.\n  - Practically: navigate corridors “between the 4s”.\n\n# KEYS, EXIT, AND HOW TO FIND THEM\n* Bottom-left KEY INDICATOR (non-interactive):\n  - A small block of 0s and 9s COMPLETELY BOXED by 4s in the bottom-left of the entire grid.\n  - This is NOT reachable and NOT a gameplay area. It only shows your CURRENT selected key.\n* EXIT (the lock to open):\n  - Elsewhere on the map, the lock is the target 0/9 pattern you must match, adjacent to some 5s (the 5s need not fully surround it).\n  - You may leave the level only when your current key EXACTLY matches this lock’s 0/9 distribution.\n* KEY GENERATOR (interactive, how to generate keys):\n  - Look for a patch consisting of 0s and 9s that has a CLEAR path of 3s leading to it and around it, and is NOT bordered by 5s or boxed by 4s.\n  - When any part of your 8×8 player steps ONTO this patch, it GENERATES a NEW candidate key and updates the bottom-left indicator.\n  - Step OFF the patch and then back ON to generate yet another candidate key; repeat to cycle through the set of keys.\n  - Continue cycling until the bottom-left indicator EXACTLY matches the lock pattern at the exit (the same 0/9 layout adjacent to 5s).\n* Locating things quickly:\n  - Generator: 0/9 patch accessible via 3s, with only 3s around it (no 5s), is almost certainly the generator.\n  - Exit: a matching 0/9 pattern near 5s marks the lock/exit area.\n\n# HUD / PROGRESSION\n* Visual score on the second-to-last grid row (row 62): it contains several 4-cell “slots”.\n  - Slots made of 3s represent UNFINISHED levels.\n  - When a slot changes from 3s to another color, that level is COMPLETE.\n* Track remaining MOVES/ENERGY by counting tiles with value 15.\n* Track LIVES by counting distinct 2×2 blocks of 8s.\n\n# GENERAL NOTES\n* The grid is a bird’s-eye view.\n* If the grid does not change after an action, you likely attempted an illegal move into 4s.\n* Favor routes marked by 3s; use the generator (0/9 patch surrounded by 3s) to cycle keys; confirm the match by comparing the bottom-left indicator (boxed by 4s) to the 0/9 lock pattern found near 5s; then proceed to the exit.\n\n# EXAMPLE STRATEGY OBSERVATION\nThe 8×8 player (top rows 12s, bottom rows 9s) is touching 4s on the left, so LEFT is blocked. I see a 0/9 patch with only 3s around it to the right—that’s likely the generator. I should move RIGHT to step on/off it until the bottom-left indicator (boxed by 4s) matches the lock pattern I see near the 5s, then head to the exit.\n\n# TURN:\nCall exactly one action.\n\n"

    "content": "\n# CONTEXT:\nYou are an agent playing a dynamic game. Your objective is to\nWIN and avoid GAME_OVER while minimizing actions.\n\nOne action produces one Frame. One Frame is made of one or more sequential\nGrids. Each Grid is a matrix size INT<0,63> by INT<0,63> filled with\nINT<0,15> values. Each value represents a different color and usually implies a different object.\n\nYou are playing a game called LockSmith.\n\n# CONTROLS\n* RESET: start over\n* ACTION1: move up\n* ACTION2: move down\n* ACTION3: move left\n* ACTION4: move right\n* ACTION5/ACTION6: no-ops\n\n# ORIENTATION (read carefully)\n* The global frame is fixed: the bottom-left KEY INDICATOR is always at the bottom-left; the EXIT/lock is elsewhere.\n* ACTION1 (UP) moves you toward the area where 15s (move counters) are located; use this as a compass for “up.”\n* ACTION4 (RIGHT) increases your distance from the bottom-left key indicator; ACTION3 (LEFT) decreases it.\n* Legality checks with 4s (walls):\n  - RIGHT is ILLEGAL if any 4s lie immediately to the right (“after” in row order) of any 12/9 cells of your 8×8 player.\n  - LEFT is ILLEGAL if any 4s lie immediately to the left (“before” in row order) of any 12/9 cells of your 8×8 player.\n  - UP is ILLEGAL if any 4s lie directly above the topmost 12 row of your player.\n  - DOWN is ILLEGAL if any 4s lie directly below the bottommost 9 row of your player.\n* Always orient carefully before moving: check where the 15s lie (for UP), how far you are from the bottom-left indicator (for LEFT/RIGHT), and whether 4s precede/follow your 12s/9s in the intended direction.\n\n# GOAL\nFind/generate a key that MATCHES the key pattern shown at the EXIT, then navigate to the EXIT to finish the level.\nThere are 6 levels total. Complete all levels to WIN.\n\n# TILE MEANINGS (important ones)\n* 0 = white cell (used in key patterns)\n* 3 = walkable path / corridor marker (often outlines routes to key/exit)\n* 4 = WALL (solid). You cannot enter 4s.\n* 5 = EXIT indicator (presence of 5s marks/frames the exit area)\n* 8 = LIFE token (count lives as the number of 2×2 blocks of 8s)\n* 9 = blue cells (used in player lower body; also appear elsewhere in the map and in key logic)\n* 12 = orange cells (used in player upper body)\n* 15 = MOVE counter (number of 15s ≈ moves/energy left)\n\n# PLAYER (sprite + movement legality)\n* The player is an 8×8 sprite made ONLY of 12s (top two rows) over 9s (bottom six rows).\n  - Concretely: rows 0–1 (relative to the sprite) are all 12s; rows 2–7 are all 9s.\n  - Other scattered 9s on the board are NOT the player—only the exact 8×8 (2×8 of 12s stacked on 6×8 of 9s) is the player.\n* Movement rules:\n  - You may move only through non-4 cells (i.e., never overlap a 4 after a move).\n  - If any part of your 8×8 sprite would overlap a 4 in the target direction (including cases where 4s lie “under” 9s), that move is ILLEGAL.\n  - If your sprite is already touching 4s on a side, you cannot move further in that touching direction until you have clearance.\n  - Practically: navigate corridors “between the 4s”.\n\n# KEYS, EXIT, AND HOW TO FIND THEM\n* Bottom-left KEY INDICATOR (non-interactive):\n  - A small block of 0s and 9s COMPLETELY BOXED by 4s in the bottom-left of the entire grid.\n  - This is NOT reachable and NOT a gameplay area. It only shows your CURRENT selected key.\n* EXIT (the lock to open):\n  - Elsewhere on the map, the lock is the target 0/9 pattern you must match, adjacent to some 5s (the 5s need not fully surround it).\n  - You may leave the level only when your current key EXACTLY matches this lock’s 0/9 distribution.\n* KEY GENERATOR (interactive, how to generate keys):\n  - Look for a patch consisting of 0s and 9s that has a CLEAR path of 3s leading to it and around it, and is NOT bordered by 5s or boxed by 4s.\n  - When any part of your 8×8 player steps ONTO this patch, it GENERATES a NEW candidate key and updates the bottom-left indicator.\n  - Step OFF the patch and then back ON to generate yet another candidate key; repeat to cycle through the set of keys.\n  - Continue cycling until the bottom-left indicator EXACTLY matches the lock pattern at the exit (the same 0/9 layout adjacent to 5s).\n* Locating things quickly:\n  - Generator: 0/9 patch accessible via 3s, with only 3s around it (no 5s), is almost certainly the generator.\n  - Exit: a matching 0/9 pattern near 5s marks the lock/exit area.\n\n# HUD / PROGRESSION\n* Visual score on the second-to-last grid row (row 62): it contains several 4-cell “slots”.\n  - Slots made of 3s represent UNFINISHED levels.\n  - When a slot changes from 3s to another color, that level is COMPLETE.\n* Track remaining MOVES/ENERGY by counting tiles with value 15.\n* Track LIVES by counting distinct 2×2 blocks of 8s.\n\n# GENERAL NOTES\n* The grid is a bird’s-eye view.\n* If the grid does not change after an action, you likely attempted an illegal move into 4s.\n* Favor routes marked by 3s; use the generator (0/9 patch surrounded by 3s) to cycle keys; confirm the match by comparing the bottom-left indicator (boxed by 4s) to the 0/9 lock pattern found near 5s; then proceed to the exit.\n\n# EXAMPLE STRATEGY OBSERVATION\nThe 8×8 player (top rows 12s, bottom rows 9s) is touching 4s on the left, so LEFT is blocked. I see a 0/9 patch with only 3s around it to the right—that’s likely the generator. I should move RIGHT to step on/off it until the bottom-left indicator (boxed by 4s) matches the lock pattern I see near the 5s, then head to the exit.\n\n# TURN:\nCall exactly one action.\n\n"

    "content": "\n# CONTEXT:\nYou are an agent playing a dynamic game. Your objective is to\nWIN and avoid GAME_OVER while minimizing actions.\n\nOne action produces one Frame. One Frame is made of one or more sequential\nGrids. Each Grid is a matrix size INT<0,63> by INT<0,63> filled with\nINT<0,15> values. Each value represents a different color and usually implies a different object.\n\nYou are playing a game called LockSmith.\n\n# CONTROLS\n* RESET: start over\n* ACTION1: move up\n* ACTION2: move down\n* ACTION3: move left\n* ACTION4: move right\n* ACTION5/ACTION6: no-ops\n\n# ORIENTATION (read carefully)\n* The global frame is fixed: the bottom-left KEY INDICATOR is always at the bottom-left; the EXIT/lock is elsewhere.\n* ACTION1 (UP) moves you toward the area where 15s (move counters) are located; use this as a compass for “up.”\n* ACTION4 (RIGHT) increases your distance from the bottom-left key indicator; ACTION3 (LEFT) decreases it.\n* Legality checks with 4s (walls):\n  - RIGHT is ILLEGAL if any 4s lie immediately to the right (“after” in row order) of any 12/9 cells of your 8×8 player.\n  - LEFT is ILLEGAL if any 4s lie immediately to the left (“before” in row order) of any 12/9 cells of your 8×8 player.\n  - UP is ILLEGAL if any 4s lie directly above the topmost 12 row of your player.\n  - DOWN is ILLEGAL if any 4s lie directly below the bottommost 9 row of your player.\n* Always orient carefully before moving: check where the 15s lie (for UP), how far you are from the bottom-left indicator (for LEFT/RIGHT), and whether 4s precede/follow your 12s/9s in the intended direction.\n\n# GOAL\nFind/generate a key that MATCHES the key pattern shown at the EXIT, then navigate to the EXIT to finish the level.\nThere are 6 levels total. Complete all levels to WIN.\n\n# TILE MEANINGS (important ones)\n* 0 = white cell (used in key patterns)\n* 3 = walkable path / corridor marker (often outlines routes to key/exit)\n* 4 = WALL (solid). You cannot enter 4s.\n* 5 = EXIT indicator (presence of 5s marks/frames the exit area)\n* 8 = LIFE token (count lives as the number of 2×2 blocks of 8s)\n* 9 = blue cells (used in player lower body; also appear elsewhere in the map and in key logic)\n* 12 = orange cells (used in player upper body)\n* 15 = MOVE counter (number of 15s ≈ moves/energy left)\n\n# PLAYER (sprite + movement legality)\n* The player is an 8×8 sprite made ONLY of 12s (top two rows) over 9s (bottom six rows).\n  - Concretely: rows 0–1 (relative to the sprite) are all 12s; rows 2–7 are all 9s.\n  - Other scattered 9s on the board are NOT the player—only the exact 8×8 (2×8 of 12s stacked on 6×8 of 9s) is the player.\n* Movement rules:\n  - You may move only through non-4 cells (i.e., never overlap a 4 after a move).\n  - If any part of your 8×8 sprite would overlap a 4 in the target direction (including cases where 4s lie “under” 9s), that move is ILLEGAL.\n  - If your sprite is already touching 4s on a side, you cannot move further in that touching direction until you have clearance.\n  - Practically: navigate corridors “between the 4s”.\n\n# KEYS, EXIT, AND HOW TO FIND THEM\n* Bottom-left KEY INDICATOR (non-interactive):\n  - A small block of 0s and 9s COMPLETELY BOXED by 4s in the bottom-left of the entire grid.\n  - This is NOT reachable and NOT a gameplay area. It only shows your CURRENT selected key.\n* EXIT (the lock to open):\n  - Elsewhere on the map, the lock is the target 0/9 pattern you must match, adjacent to some 5s (the 5s need not fully surround it).\n  - You may leave the level only when your current key EXACTLY matches this lock’s 0/9 distribution.\n* KEY GENERATOR (interactive, how to generate keys):\n  - Look for a patch consisting of 0s and 9s that has a CLEAR path of 3s leading to it and around it, and is NOT bordered by 5s or boxed by 4s.\n  - When any part of your 8×8 player steps ONTO this patch, it GENERATES a NEW candidate key and updates the bottom-left indicator.\n  - Step OFF the patch and then back ON to generate yet another candidate key; repeat to cycle through the set of keys.\n  - Continue cycling until the bottom-left indicator EXACTLY matches the lock pattern at the exit (the same 0/9 layout adjacent to 5s).\n* Locating things quickly:\n  - Generator: 0/9 patch accessible via 3s, with only 3s around it (no 5s), is almost certainly the generator.\n  - Exit: a matching 0/9 pattern near 5s marks the lock/exit area.\n\n# HUD / PROGRESSION\n* Visual score on the second-to-last grid row (row 62): it contains several 4-cell “slots”.\n  - Slots made of 3s represent UNFINISHED levels.\n  - When a slot changes from 3s to another color, that level is COMPLETE.\n* Track remaining MOVES/ENERGY by counting tiles with value 15.\n* Track LIVES by counting distinct 2×2 blocks of 8s.\n\n# GENERAL NOTES\n* The grid is a bird’s-eye view.\n* If the grid does not change after an action, you likely attempted an illegal move into 4s.\n* Favor routes marked by 3s; use the generator (0/9 patch surrounded by 3s) to cycle keys; confirm the match by comparing the bottom-left indicator (boxed by 4s) to the 0/9 lock pattern found near 5s; then proceed to the exit.\n\n# EXAMPLE STRATEGY OBSERVATION\nThe 8×8 player (top rows 12s, bottom rows 9s) is touching 4s on the left, so LEFT is blocked. I see a 0/9 patch with only 3s around it to the right—that’s likely the generator. I should move RIGHT to step on/off it until the bottom-left indicator (boxed by 4s) matches the lock pattern I see near the 5s, then head to the exit.\n\n# TURN:\nCall exactly one action.\n\n"

Each value represents a different color and usually implies a different object.\n\nYou are playing a game called LockSmith.\n\n# CONTROLS\n* RESET: start over\n* ACTION1: move up\n* ACTION2: move down\n* ACTION3: move left\n* ACTION4: move right\n* ACTION5/ACTION6: no-ops\n\n# ORIENTATION (read carefully)\n* The global frame is fixed: the bottom-left KEY INDICATOR is always at the bottom-left; the EXIT/lock is elsewhere.\n* ACTION1 (UP) moves you toward the area where 15s (move counters) are located; use this as a compass for “up.”\n* ACTION4 (RIGHT) increases your distance from the bottom-left key indicator; ACTION3 (LEFT) decreases it.\n* Legality checks with 4s (walls):\n  - RIGHT is ILLEGAL if any 4s lie immediately to the right (“after” in row order) of any 12/9 cells of your 8×8 player.\n  - LEFT is ILLEGAL if any 4s lie immediately to the left (“before” in row order) of any 12/9 cells of your 8×8 player.\n  - UP is ILLEGAL if any 4s lie directly above the topmost 12 row of your player.\n  - DOWN is ILLEGAL if any 4s lie directly below the bottommost 9 row of your player.\n* Always orient carefully before moving: check where the 15s lie (for UP), how far you are from the bottom-left indicator (for LEFT/RIGHT), and whether 4s precede/follow your 12s/9s in the intended direction.\n\n# GOAL\nFind/generate a key that MATCHES the key pattern shown at the EXIT, then navigate to the EXIT to finish the level.\nThere are 6 levels total. Complete all levels to WIN.\n\n# TILE MEANINGS (important ones)\n* 0 = white cell (used in key patterns)\n* 3 = walkable path / corridor marker (often outlines routes to key/exit)\n* 4 = WALL (solid). You cannot enter 4s.\n* 5 = EXIT indicator (presence of 5s marks/frames the exit area)\n* 8 = LIFE token (count lives as the number of 2×2 blocks of 8s)\n* 9 = blue cells (used in player lower body; also appear elsewhere in the map and in key logic)\n* 12 = orange cells (used in player upper body)\n* 15 = MOVE counter (number of 15s ≈ moves/energy left)\n\n# PLAYER (sprite + movement legality)\n* The player is an 8×8 sprite made ONLY of 12s (top two rows) over 9s (bottom six rows).\n  - Concretely: rows 0–1 (relative to the sprite) are all 12s; rows 2–7 are all 9s.\n  - Other scattered 9s on the board are NOT the player—only the exact 8×8 (2×8 of 12s stacked on 6×8 of 9s) is the player.\n* Movement rules:\n  - You may move only through non-4 cells (i.e., never overlap a 4 after a move).\n  - If any part of your 8×8 sprite would overlap a 4 in the target direction (including cases where 4s lie “under” 9s), that move is ILLEGAL.\n  - If your sprite is already touching 4s on a side, you cannot move further in that touching direction until you have clearance.\n  - Practically: navigate corridors “between the 4s”.\n\n# KEYS, EXIT, AND HOW TO FIND THEM\n* Bottom-left KEY INDICATOR (non-interactive):\n  - A small block of 0s and 9s COMPLETELY BOXED by 4s in the bottom-left of the entire grid.\n  - This is NOT reachable and NOT a gameplay area. It only shows your CURRENT selected key.\n* EXIT (the lock to open):\n  - Elsewhere on the map, the lock is the target 0/9 pattern you must match, adjacent to some 5s (the 5s need not fully surround it).\n  - You may leave the level only when your current key EXACTLY matches this lock’s 0/9 distribution.\n* KEY GENERATOR (interactive, how to generate keys):\n  - Look for a patch consisting of 0s and 9s that has a CLEAR path of 3s leading to it and around it, and is NOT bordered by 5s or boxed by 4s.\n  - When any part of your 8×8 player steps ONTO this patch, it GENERATES a NEW candidate key and updates the bottom-left indicator.\n  - Step OFF the patch and then back ON to generate yet another candidate key; repeat to cycle through the set of keys.\n  - Continue cycling until the bottom-left indicator EXACTLY matches the lock pattern at the exit (the same 0/9 layout adjacent to 5s).\n* Locating things quickly:\n  - Generator: 0/9 patch accessible via 3s, with only 3s around it (no 5s), is almost certainly the generator.\n  - Exit: a matching 0/9 pattern near 5s marks the lock/exit area.\n\n# HUD / PROGRESSION\n* Visual score on the second-to-last grid row (row 62): it contains several 4-cell “slots”.\n  - Slots made of 3s represent UNFINISHED levels.\n  - When a slot changes from 3s to another color, that level is COMPLETE.\n* Track remaining MOVES/ENERGY by counting tiles with value 15.\n* Track LIVES by counting distinct 2×2 blocks of 8s.\n\n# GENERAL NOTES\n* The grid is a bird’s-eye view.\n* If the grid does not change after an action, you likely attempted an illegal move into 4s.\n* Favor routes marked by 3s; use the generator (0/9 patch surrounded by 3s) to cycle keys; confirm the match by comparing the bottom-left indicator (boxed by 4s) to the 0/9 lock pattern found near 5s; then proceed to the exit.\n\n# EXAMPLE STRATEGY OBSERVATION\nThe 8×8 player (top rows 12s, bottom rows 9s) is touching 4s on the left, so LEFT is blocked. I see a 0/9 patch with only 3s around it to the right—that’s likely the generator. I should move RIGHT to step on/off it until the bottom-left indicator (boxed by 4s) matches the lock pattern I see near the 5s, then head to the exit.\n\n# TURN:\nCall exactly one action.\n\n"

    "content": "\n# CONTEXT:\nYou are an agent playing a dynamic game. Your objective is to\nWIN and avoid GAME_OVER while minimizing actions.\n\nOne action produces one Frame. One Frame is made of one or more sequential\nGrids. Each Grid is a matrix size INT<0,63> by INT<0,63> filled with\nINT<0,15> values. Each value represents a different color and usually implies a different object.\n\nYou are playing a game called LockSmith.\n\n# CONTROLS\n* RESET: start over\n* ACTION1: move up\n* ACTION2: move down\n* ACTION3: move left\n* ACTION4: move right\n* ACTION5/ACTION6: no-ops\n\n# ORIENTATION (read carefully)\n* The global frame is fixed: the bottom-left KEY INDICATOR is always at the bottom-left; the EXIT/lock is elsewhere.\n* ACTION1 (UP) moves you toward the area where 15s (move counters) are located; use this as a compass for “up.”\n* ACTION4 (RIGHT) increases your distance from the bottom-left key indicator; ACTION3 (LEFT) decreases it.\n* Legality checks with 4s (walls):\n  - RIGHT is ILLEGAL if any 4s lie immediately to the right (“after” in row order) of any 12/9 cells of your 8×8 player.\n  - LEFT is ILLEGAL if any 4s lie immediately to the left (“before” in row order) of any 12/9 cells of your 8×8 player.\n  - UP is ILLEGAL if any 4s lie directly above the topmost 12 row of your player.\n  - DOWN is ILLEGAL if any 4s lie directly below the bottommost 9 row of your player.\n* Always orient carefully before moving: check where the 15s lie (for UP), how far you are from the bottom-left indicator (for LEFT/RIGHT), and whether 4s precede/follow your 12s/9s in the intended direction.\n\n# GOAL\nFind/generate a key that MATCHES the key pattern shown at the EXIT, then navigate to the EXIT to finish the level.\nThere are 6 levels total. Complete all levels to WIN.\n\n# TILE MEANINGS (important ones)\n* 0 = white cell (used in key patterns)\n* 3 = walkable path / corridor marker (often outlines routes to key/exit)\n* 4 = WALL (solid). You cannot enter 4s.\n* 5 = EXIT indicator (presence of 5s marks/frames the exit area)\n* 8 = LIFE token (count lives as the number of 2×2 blocks of 8s)\n* 9 = blue cells (used in player lower body; also appear elsewhere in the map and in key logic)\n* 12 = orange cells (used in player upper body)\n* 15 = MOVE counter (number of 15s ≈ moves/energy left)\n\n# PLAYER (sprite + movement legality)\n* The player is an 8×8 sprite made ONLY of 12s (top two rows) over 9s (bottom six rows).\n  - Concretely: rows 0–1 (relative to the sprite) are all 12s; rows 2–7 are all 9s.\n  - Other scattered 9s on the board are NOT the player—only the exact 8×8 (2×8 of 12s stacked on 6×8 of 9s) is the player.\n* Movement rules:\n  - You may move only through non-4 cells (i.e., never overlap a 4 after a move).\n  - If any part of your 8×8 sprite would overlap a 4 in the target direction (including cases where 4s lie “under” 9s), that move is ILLEGAL.\n  - If your sprite is already touching 4s on a side, you cannot move further in that touching direction until you have clearance.\n  - Practically: navigate corridors “between the 4s”.\n\n# KEYS, EXIT, AND HOW TO FIND THEM\n* Bottom-left KEY INDICATOR (non-interactive):\n  - A small block of 0s and 9s COMPLETELY BOXED by 4s in the bottom-left of the entire grid.\n  - This is NOT reachable and NOT a gameplay area. It only shows your CURRENT selected key.\n* EXIT (the lock to open):\n  - Elsewhere on the map, the lock is the target 0/9 pattern you must match, adjacent to some 5s (the 5s need not fully surround it).\n  - You may leave the level only when your current key EXACTLY matches this lock’s 0/9 distribution.\n* KEY GENERATOR (interactive, how to generate keys):\n  - Look for a patch consisting of 0s and 9s that has a CLEAR path of 3s leading to it and around it, and is NOT bordered by 5s or boxed by 4s.\n  - When any part of your 8×8 player steps ONTO this patch, it GENERATES a NEW candidate key and updates the bottom-left indicator.\n  - Step OFF the patch and then back ON to generate yet another candidate key; repeat to cycle through the set of keys.\n  - Continue cycling until the bottom-left indicator EXACTLY matches the lock pattern at the exit (the same 0/9 layout adjacent to 5s).\n* Locating things quickly:\n  - Generator: 0/9 patch accessible via 3s, with only 3s around it (no 5s), is almost certainly the generator.\n  - Exit: a matching 0/9 pattern near 5s marks the lock/exit area.\n\n# HUD / PROGRESSION\n* Visual score on the second-to-last grid row (row 62): it contains several 4-cell “slots”.\n  - Slots made of 3s represent UNFINISHED levels.\n  - When a slot changes from 3s to another color, that level is COMPLETE.\n* Track remaining MOVES/ENERGY by counting tiles with value 15.\n* Track LIVES by counting distinct 2×2 blocks of 8s.\n\n# GENERAL NOTES\n* The grid is a bird’s-eye view.\n* If the grid does not change after an action, you likely attempted an illegal move into 4s.\n* Favor routes marked by 3s; use the generator (0/9 patch surrounded by 3s) to cycle keys; confirm the match by comparing the bottom-left indicator (boxed by 4s) to the 0/9 lock pattern found near 5s; then proceed to the exit.\n\n# EXAMPLE STRATEGY OBSERVATION\nThe 8×8 player (top rows 12s, bottom rows 9s) is touching 4s on the left, so LEFT is blocked. I see a 0/9 patch with only 3s around it to the right—that’s likely the generator. I should move RIGHT to step on/off it until the bottom-left indicator (boxed by 4s) matches the lock pattern I see near the 5s, then head to the exit.\n\n# TURN:\nCall exactly one action.\n\n"

One Frame is made of one or more sequential\nGrids. Each Grid is a matrix size INT<0,63> by INT<0,63> filled with\nINT<0,15> values. Each value represents a different color and usually implies a different object.\n\nYou are playing a game called LockSmith.\n\n# CONTROLS\n* RESET: start over\n* ACTION1: move up\n* ACTION2: move down\n* ACTION3: move left\n* ACTION4: move right\n* ACTION5/ACTION6: no-ops\n\n# ORIENTATION (read carefully)\n* The global frame is fixed: the bottom-left KEY INDICATOR is always at the bottom-left; the EXIT/lock is elsewhere.\n* ACTION1 (UP) moves you toward the area where 15s (move counters) are located; use this as a compass for “up.”\n* ACTION4 (RIGHT) increases your distance from the bottom-left key indicator; ACTION3 (LEFT) decreases it.\n* Legality checks with 4s (walls):\n  - RIGHT is ILLEGAL if any 4s lie immediately to the right (“after” in row order) of any 12/9 cells of your 8×8 player.\n  - LEFT is ILLEGAL if any 4s lie immediately to the left (“before” in row order) of any 12/9 cells of your 8×8 player.\n  - UP is ILLEGAL if any 4s lie directly above the topmost 12 row of your player.\n  - DOWN is ILLEGAL if any 4s lie directly below the bottommost 9 row of your player.\n* Always orient carefully before moving: check where the 15s lie (for UP), how far you are from the bottom-left indicator (for LEFT/RIGHT), and whether 4s precede/follow your 12s/9s in the intended direction.\n\n# GOAL\nFind/generate a key that MATCHES the key pattern shown at the EXIT, then navigate to the EXIT to finish the level.\nThere are 6 levels total. Complete all levels to WIN.\n\n# TILE MEANINGS (important ones)\n* 0 = white cell (used in key patterns)\n* 3 = walkable path / corridor marker (often outlines routes to key/exit)\n* 4 = WALL (solid). You cannot enter 4s.\n* 5 = EXIT indicator (presence of 5s marks/frames the exit area)\n* 8 = LIFE token (count lives as the number of 2×2 blocks of 8s)\n* 9 = blue cells (used in player lower body; also appear elsewhere in the map and in key logic)\n* 12 = orange cells (used in player upper body)\n* 15 = MOVE counter (number of 15s ≈ moves/energy left)\n\n# PLAYER (sprite + movement legality)\n* The player is an 8×8 sprite made ONLY of 12s (top two rows) over 9s (bottom six rows).\n  - Concretely: rows 0–1 (relative to the sprite) are all 12s; rows 2–7 are all 9s.\n  - Other scattered 9s on the board are NOT the player—only the exact 8×8 (2×8 of 12s stacked on 6×8 of 9s) is the player.\n* Movement rules:\n  - You may move only through non-4 cells (i.e., never overlap a 4 after a move).\n  - If any part of your 8×8 sprite would overlap a 4 in the target direction (including cases where 4s lie “under” 9s), that move is ILLEGAL.\n  - If your sprite is already touching 4s on a side, you cannot move further in that touching direction until you have clearance.\n  - Practically: navigate corridors “between the 4s”.\n\n# KEYS, EXIT, AND HOW TO FIND THEM\n* Bottom-left KEY INDICATOR (non-interactive):\n  - A small block of 0s and 9s COMPLETELY BOXED by 4s in the bottom-left of the entire grid.\n  - This is NOT reachable and NOT a gameplay area. It only shows your CURRENT selected key.\n* EXIT (the lock to open):\n  - Elsewhere on the map, the lock is the target 0/9 pattern you must match, adjacent to some 5s (the 5s need not fully surround it).\n  - You may leave the level only when your current key EXACTLY matches this lock’s 0/9 distribution.\n* KEY GENERATOR (interactive, how to generate keys):\n  - Look for a patch consisting of 0s and 9s that has a CLEAR path of 3s leading to it and around it, and is NOT bordered by 5s or boxed by 4s.\n  - When any part of your 8×8 player steps ONTO this patch, it GENERATES a NEW candidate key and updates the bottom-left indicator.\n  - Step OFF the patch and then back ON to generate yet another candidate key; repeat to cycle through the set of keys.\n  - Continue cycling until the bottom-left indicator EXACTLY matches the lock pattern at the exit (the same 0/9 layout adjacent to 5s).\n* Locating things quickly:\n  - Generator: 0/9 patch accessible via 3s, with only 3s around it (no 5s), is almost certainly the generator.\n  - Exit: a matching 0/9 pattern near 5s marks the lock/exit area.\n\n# HUD / PROGRESSION\n* Visual score on the second-to-last grid row (row 62): it contains several 4-cell “slots”.\n  - Slots made of 3s represent UNFINISHED levels.\n  - When a slot changes from 3s to another color, that level is COMPLETE.\n* Track remaining MOVES/ENERGY by counting tiles with value 15.\n* Track LIVES by counting distinct 2×2 blocks of 8s.\n\n# GENERAL NOTES\n* The grid is a bird’s-eye view.\n* If the grid does not change after an action, you likely attempted an illegal move into 4s.\n* Favor routes marked by 3s; use the generator (0/9 patch surrounded by 3s) to cycle keys; confirm the match by comparing the bottom-left indicator (boxed by 4s) to the 0/9 lock pattern found near 5s; then proceed to the exit.\n\n# EXAMPLE STRATEGY OBSERVATION\nThe 8×8 player (top rows 12s, bottom rows 9s) is touching 4s on the left, so LEFT is blocked. I see a 0/9 patch with only 3s around it to the right—that’s likely the generator. I should move RIGHT to step on/off it until the bottom-left indicator (boxed by 4s) matches the lock pattern I see near the 5s, then head to the exit.\n\n# TURN:\nCall exactly one action.\n\n"

    "content": "\n# CONTEXT:\nYou are an agent playing a dynamic game. Your objective is to\nWIN and avoid GAME_OVER while minimizing actions.\n\nOne action produces one Frame. One Frame is made of one or more sequential\nGrids. Each Grid is a matrix size INT<0,63> by INT<0,63> filled with\nINT<0,15> values. Each value represents a different color and usually implies a different object.\n\nYou are playing a game called LockSmith.\n\n# CONTROLS\n* RESET: start over\n* ACTION1: move up\n* ACTION2: move down\n* ACTION3: move left\n* ACTION4: move right\n* ACTION5/ACTION6: no-ops\n\n# ORIENTATION (read carefully)\n* The global frame is fixed: the bottom-left KEY INDICATOR is always at the bottom-left; the EXIT/lock is elsewhere.\n* ACTION1 (UP) moves you toward the area where 15s (move counters) are located; use this as a compass for “up.”\n* ACTION4 (RIGHT) increases your distance from the bottom-left key indicator; ACTION3 (LEFT) decreases it.\n* Legality checks with 4s (walls):\n  - RIGHT is ILLEGAL if any 4s lie immediately to the right (“after” in row order) of any 12/9 cells of your 8×8 player.\n  - LEFT is ILLEGAL if any 4s lie immediately to the left (“before” in row order) of any 12/9 cells of your 8×8 player.\n  - UP is ILLEGAL if any 4s lie directly above the topmost 12 row of your player.\n  - DOWN is ILLEGAL if any 4s lie directly below the bottommost 9 row of your player.\n* Always orient carefully before moving: check where the 15s lie (for UP), how far you are from the bottom-left indicator (for LEFT/RIGHT), and whether 4s precede/follow your 12s/9s in the intended direction.\n\n# GOAL\nFind/generate a key that MATCHES the key pattern shown at the EXIT, then navigate to the EXIT to finish the level.\nThere are 6 levels total. Complete all levels to WIN.\n\n# TILE MEANINGS (important ones)\n* 0 = white cell (used in key patterns)\n* 3 = walkable path / corridor marker (often outlines routes to key/exit)\n* 4 = WALL (solid). You cannot enter 4s.\n* 5 = EXIT indicator (presence of 5s marks/frames the exit area)\n* 8 = LIFE token (count lives as the number of 2×2 blocks of 8s)\n* 9 = blue cells (used in player lower body; also appear elsewhere in the map and in key logic)\n* 12 = orange cells (used in player upper body)\n* 15 = MOVE counter (number of 15s ≈ moves/energy left)\n\n# PLAYER (sprite + movement legality)\n* The player is an 8×8 sprite made ONLY of 12s (top two rows) over 9s (bottom six rows).\n  - Concretely: rows 0–1 (relative to the sprite) are all 12s; rows 2–7 are all 9s.\n  - Other scattered 9s on the board are NOT the player—only the exact 8×8 (2×8 of 12s stacked on 6×8 of 9s) is the player.\n* Movement rules:\n  - You may move only through non-4 cells (i.e., never overlap a 4 after a move).\n  - If any part of your 8×8 sprite would overlap a 4 in the target direction (including cases where 4s lie “under” 9s), that move is ILLEGAL.\n  - If your sprite is already touching 4s on a side, you cannot move further in that touching direction until you have clearance.\n  - Practically: navigate corridors “between the 4s”.\n\n# KEYS, EXIT, AND HOW TO FIND THEM\n* Bottom-left KEY INDICATOR (non-interactive):\n  - A small block of 0s and 9s COMPLETELY BOXED by 4s in the bottom-left of the entire grid.\n  - This is NOT reachable and NOT a gameplay area. It only shows your CURRENT selected key.\n* EXIT (the lock to open):\n  - Elsewhere on the map, the lock is the target 0/9 pattern you must match, adjacent to some 5s (the 5s need not fully surround it).\n  - You may leave the level only when your current key EXACTLY matches this lock’s 0/9 distribution.\n* KEY GENERATOR (interactive, how to generate keys):\n  - Look for a patch consisting of 0s and 9s that has a CLEAR path of 3s leading to it and around it, and is NOT bordered by 5s or boxed by 4s.\n  - When any part of your 8×8 player steps ONTO this patch, it GENERATES a NEW candidate key and updates the bottom-left indicator.\n  - Step OFF the patch and then back ON to generate yet another candidate key; repeat to cycle through the set of keys.\n  - Continue cycling until the bottom-left indicator EXACTLY matches the lock pattern at the exit (the same 0/9 layout adjacent to 5s).\n* Locating things quickly:\n  - Generator: 0/9 patch accessible via 3s, with only 3s around it (no 5s), is almost certainly the generator.\n  - Exit: a matching 0/9 pattern near 5s marks the lock/exit area.\n\n# HUD / PROGRESSION\n* Visual score on the second-to-last grid row (row 62): it contains several 4-cell “slots”.\n  - Slots made of 3s represent UNFINISHED levels.\n  - When a slot changes from 3s to another color, that level is COMPLETE.\n* Track remaining MOVES/ENERGY by counting tiles with value 15.\n* Track LIVES by counting distinct 2×2 blocks of 8s.\n\n# GENERAL NOTES\n* The grid is a bird’s-eye view.\n* If the grid does not change after an action, you likely attempted an illegal move into 4s.\n* Favor routes marked by 3s; use the generator (0/9 patch surrounded by 3s) to cycle keys; confirm the match by comparing the bottom-left indicator (boxed by 4s) to the 0/9 lock pattern found near 5s; then proceed to the exit.\n\n# EXAMPLE STRATEGY OBSERVATION\nThe 8×8 player (top rows 12s, bottom rows 9s) is touching 4s on the left, so LEFT is blocked. I see a 0/9 patch with only 3s around it to the right—that’s likely the generator. I should move RIGHT to step on/off it until the bottom-left indicator (boxed by 4s) matches the lock pattern I see near the 5s, then head to the exit.\n\n# TURN:\nCall exactly one action.\n\n"

    "content": "\n# CONTEXT:\nYou are an agent playing a dynamic game. Your objective is to\nWIN and avoid GAME_OVER while minimizing actions.\n\nOne action produces one Frame. One Frame is made of one or more sequential\nGrids. Each Grid is a matrix size INT<0,63> by INT<0,63> filled with\nINT<0,15> values. Each value represents a different color and usually implies a different object.\n\nYou are playing a game called LockSmith.\n\n# CONTROLS\n* RESET: start over\n* ACTION1: move up\n* ACTION2: move down\n* ACTION3: move left\n* ACTION4: move right\n* ACTION5/ACTION6: no-ops\n\n# ORIENTATION (read carefully)\n* The global frame is fixed: the bottom-left KEY INDICATOR is always at the bottom-left; the EXIT/lock is elsewhere.\n* ACTION1 (UP) moves you toward the area where 15s (move counters) are located; use this as a compass for “up.”\n* ACTION4 (RIGHT) increases your distance from the bottom-left key indicator; ACTION3 (LEFT) decreases it.\n* Legality checks with 4s (walls):\n  - RIGHT is ILLEGAL if any 4s lie immediately to the right (“after” in row order) of any 12/9 cells of your 8×8 player.\n  - LEFT is ILLEGAL if any 4s lie immediately to the left (“before” in row order) of any 12/9 cells of your 8×8 player.\n  - UP is ILLEGAL if any 4s lie directly above the topmost 12 row of your player.\n  - DOWN is ILLEGAL if any 4s lie directly below the bottommost 9 row of your player.\n* Always orient carefully before moving: check where the 15s lie (for UP), how far you are from the bottom-left indicator (for LEFT/RIGHT), and whether 4s precede/follow your 12s/9s in the intended direction.\n\n# GOAL\nFind/generate a key that MATCHES the key pattern shown at the EXIT, then navigate to the EXIT to finish the level.\nThere are 6 levels total. Complete all levels to WIN.\n\n# TILE MEANINGS (important ones)\n* 0 = white cell (used in key patterns)\n* 3 = walkable path / corridor marker (often outlines routes to key/exit)\n* 4 = WALL (solid). You cannot enter 4s.\n* 5 = EXIT indicator (presence of 5s marks/frames the exit area)\n* 8 = LIFE token (count lives as the number of 2×2 blocks of 8s)\n* 9 = blue cells (used in player lower body; also appear elsewhere in the map and in key logic)\n* 12 = orange cells (used in player upper body)\n* 15 = MOVE counter (number of 15s ≈ moves/energy left)\n\n# PLAYER (sprite + movement legality)\n* The player is an 8×8 sprite made ONLY of 12s (top two rows) over 9s (bottom six rows).\n  - Concretely: rows 0–1 (relative to the sprite) are all 12s; rows 2–7 are all 9s.\n  - Other scattered 9s on the board are NOT the player—only the exact 8×8 (2×8 of 12s stacked on 6×8 of 9s) is the player.\n* Movement rules:\n  - You may move only through non-4 cells (i.e., never overlap a 4 after a move).\n  - If any part of your 8×8 sprite would overlap a 4 in the target direction (including cases where 4s lie “under” 9s), that move is ILLEGAL.\n  - If your sprite is already touching 4s on a side, you cannot move further in that touching direction until you have clearance.\n  - Practically: navigate corridors “between the 4s”.\n\n# KEYS, EXIT, AND HOW TO FIND THEM\n* Bottom-left KEY INDICATOR (non-interactive):\n  - A small block of 0s and 9s COMPLETELY BOXED by 4s in the bottom-left of the entire grid.\n  - This is NOT reachable and NOT a gameplay area. It only shows your CURRENT selected key.\n* EXIT (the lock to open):\n  - Elsewhere on the map, the lock is the target 0/9 pattern you must match, adjacent to some 5s (the 5s need not fully surround it).\n  - You may leave the level only when your current key EXACTLY matches this lock’s 0/9 distribution.\n* KEY GENERATOR (interactive, how to generate keys):\n  - Look for a patch consisting of 0s and 9s that has a CLEAR path of 3s leading to it and around it, and is NOT bordered by 5s or boxed by 4s.\n  - When any part of your 8×8 player steps ONTO this patch, it GENERATES a NEW candidate key and updates the bottom-left indicator.\n  - Step OFF the patch and then back ON to generate yet another candidate key; repeat to cycle through the set of keys.\n  - Continue cycling until the bottom-left indicator EXACTLY matches the lock pattern at the exit (the same 0/9 layout adjacent to 5s).\n* Locating things quickly:\n  - Generator: 0/9 patch accessible via 3s, with only 3s around it (no 5s), is almost certainly the generator.\n  - Exit: a matching 0/9 pattern near 5s marks the lock/exit area.\n\n# HUD / PROGRESSION\n* Visual score on the second-to-last grid row (row 62): it contains several 4-cell “slots”.\n  - Slots made of 3s represent UNFINISHED levels.\n  - When a slot changes from 3s to another color, that level is COMPLETE.\n* Track remaining MOVES/ENERGY by counting tiles with value 15.\n* Track LIVES by counting distinct 2×2 blocks of 8s.\n\n# GENERAL NOTES\n* The grid is a bird’s-eye view.\n* If the grid does not change after an action, you likely attempted an illegal move into 4s.\n* Favor routes marked by 3s; use the generator (0/9 patch surrounded by 3s) to cycle keys; confirm the match by comparing the bottom-left indicator (boxed by 4s) to the 0/9 lock pattern found near 5s; then proceed to the exit.\n\n# EXAMPLE STRATEGY OBSERVATION\nThe 8×8 player (top rows 12s, bottom rows 9s) is touching 4s on the left, so LEFT is blocked. I see a 0/9 patch with only 3s around it to the right—that’s likely the generator. I should move RIGHT to step on/off it until the bottom-left indicator (boxed by 4s) matches the lock pattern I see near the 5s, then head to the exit.\n\n# TURN:\nCall exactly one action.\n\n"

    "content": "\n# CONTEXT:\nYou are an agent playing a dynamic game. Your objective is to\nWIN and avoid GAME_OVER while minimizing actions.\n\nOne action produces one Frame. One Frame is made of one or more sequential\nGrids. Each Grid is a matrix size INT<0,63> by INT<0,63> filled with\nINT<0,15> values. Each value represents a different color and usually implies a different object.\n\nYou are playing a game called LockSmith.\n\n# CONTROLS\n* RESET: start over\n* ACTION1: move up\n* ACTION2: move down\n* ACTION3: move left\n* ACTION4: move right\n* ACTION5/ACTION6: no-ops\n\n# ORIENTATION (read carefully)\n* The global frame is fixed: the bottom-left KEY INDICATOR is always at the bottom-left; the EXIT/lock is elsewhere.\n* ACTION1 (UP) moves you toward the area where 15s (move counters) are located; use this as a compass for “up.”\n* ACTION4 (RIGHT) increases your distance from the bottom-left key indicator; ACTION3 (LEFT) decreases it.\n* Legality checks with 4s (walls):\n  - RIGHT is ILLEGAL if any 4s lie immediately to the right (“after” in row order) of any 12/9 cells of your 8×8 player.\n  - LEFT is ILLEGAL if any 4s lie immediately to the left (“before” in row order) of any 12/9 cells of your 8×8 player.\n  - UP is ILLEGAL if any 4s lie directly above the topmost 12 row of your player.\n  - DOWN is ILLEGAL if any 4s lie directly below the bottommost 9 row of your player.\n* Always orient carefully before moving: check where the 15s lie (for UP), how far you are from the bottom-left indicator (for LEFT/RIGHT), and whether 4s precede/follow your 12s/9s in the intended direction.\n\n# GOAL\nFind/generate a key that MATCHES the key pattern shown at the EXIT, then navigate to the EXIT to finish the level.\nThere are 6 levels total. Complete all levels to WIN.\n\n# TILE MEANINGS (important ones)\n* 0 = white cell (used in key patterns)\n* 3 = walkable path / corridor marker (often outlines routes to key/exit)\n* 4 = WALL (solid). You cannot enter 4s.\n* 5 = EXIT indicator (presence of 5s marks/frames the exit area)\n* 8 = LIFE token (count lives as the number of 2×2 blocks of 8s)\n* 9 = blue cells (used in player lower body; also appear elsewhere in the map and in key logic)\n* 12 = orange cells (used in player upper body)\n* 15 = MOVE counter (number of 15s ≈ moves/energy left)\n\n# PLAYER (sprite + movement legality)\n* The player is an 8×8 sprite made ONLY of 12s (top two rows) over 9s (bottom six rows).\n  - Concretely: rows 0–1 (relative to the sprite) are all 12s; rows 2–7 are all 9s.\n  - Other scattered 9s on the board are NOT the player—only the exact 8×8 (2×8 of 12s stacked on 6×8 of 9s) is the player.\n* Movement rules:\n  - You may move only through non-4 cells (i.e., never overlap a 4 after a move).\n  - If any part of your 8×8 sprite would overlap a 4 in the target direction (including cases where 4s lie “under” 9s), that move is ILLEGAL.\n  - If your sprite is already touching 4s on a side, you cannot move further in that touching direction until you have clearance.\n  - Practically: navigate corridors “between the 4s”.\n\n# KEYS, EXIT, AND HOW TO FIND THEM\n* Bottom-left KEY INDICATOR (non-interactive):\n  - A small block of 0s and 9s COMPLETELY BOXED by 4s in the bottom-left of the entire grid.\n  - This is NOT reachable and NOT a gameplay area. It only shows your CURRENT selected key.\n* EXIT (the lock to open):\n  - Elsewhere on the map, the lock is the target 0/9 pattern you must match, adjacent to some 5s (the 5s need not fully surround it).\n  - You may leave the level only when your current key EXACTLY matches this lock’s 0/9 distribution.\n* KEY GENERATOR (interactive, how to generate keys):\n  - Look for a patch consisting of 0s and 9s that has a CLEAR path of 3s leading to it and around it, and is NOT bordered by 5s or boxed by 4s.\n  - When any part of your 8×8 player steps ONTO this patch, it GENERATES a NEW candidate key and updates the bottom-left indicator.\n  - Step OFF the patch and then back ON to generate yet another candidate key; repeat to cycle through the set of keys.\n  - Continue cycling until the bottom-left indicator EXACTLY matches the lock pattern at the exit (the same 0/9 layout adjacent to 5s).\n* Locating things quickly:\n  - Generator: 0/9 patch accessible via 3s, with only 3s around it (no 5s), is almost certainly the generator.\n  - Exit: a matching 0/9 pattern near 5s marks the lock/exit area.\n\n# HUD / PROGRESSION\n* Visual score on the second-to-last grid row (row 62): it contains several 4-cell “slots”.\n  - Slots made of 3s represent UNFINISHED levels.\n  - When a slot changes from 3s to another color, that level is COMPLETE.\n* Track remaining MOVES/ENERGY by counting tiles with value 15.\n* Track LIVES by counting distinct 2×2 blocks of 8s.\n\n# GENERAL NOTES\n* The grid is a bird’s-eye view.\n* If the grid does not change after an action, you likely attempted an illegal move into 4s.\n* Favor routes marked by 3s; use the generator (0/9 patch surrounded by 3s) to cycle keys; confirm the match by comparing the bottom-left indicator (boxed by 4s) to the 0/9 lock pattern found near 5s; then proceed to the exit.\n\n# EXAMPLE STRATEGY OBSERVATION\nThe 8×8 player (top rows 12s, bottom rows 9s) is touching 4s on the left, so LEFT is blocked. I see a 0/9 patch with only 3s around it to the right—that’s likely the generator. I should move RIGHT to step on/off it until the bottom-left indicator (boxed by 4s) matches the lock pattern I see near the 5s, then head to the exit.\n\n# TURN:\nCall exactly one action.\n\n"

    "content": "\n# CONTEXT:\nYou are an agent playing a dynamic game. Your objective is to\nWIN and avoid GAME_OVER while minimizing actions.\n\nOne action produces one Frame. One Frame is made of one or more sequential\nGrids. Each Grid is a matrix size INT<0,63> by INT<0,63> filled with\nINT<0,15> values. Each value represents a different color and usually implies a different object.\n\nYou are playing a game called LockSmith.\n\n# CONTROLS\n* RESET: start over\n* ACTION1: move up\n* ACTION2: move down\n* ACTION3: move left\n* ACTION4: move right\n* ACTION5/ACTION6: no-ops\n\n# ORIENTATION (read carefully)\n* The global frame is fixed: the bottom-left KEY INDICATOR is always at the bottom-left; the EXIT/lock is elsewhere.\n* ACTION1 (UP) moves you toward the area where 15s (move counters) are located; use this as a compass for “up.”\n* ACTION4 (RIGHT) increases your distance from the bottom-left key indicator; ACTION3 (LEFT) decreases it.\n* Legality checks with 4s (walls):\n  - RIGHT is ILLEGAL if any 4s lie immediately to the right (“after” in row order) of any 12/9 cells of your 8×8 player.\n  - LEFT is ILLEGAL if any 4s lie immediately to the left (“before” in row order) of any 12/9 cells of your 8×8 player.\n  - UP is ILLEGAL if any 4s lie directly above the topmost 12 row of your player.\n  - DOWN is ILLEGAL if any 4s lie directly below the bottommost 9 row of your player.\n* Always orient carefully before moving: check where the 15s lie (for UP), how far you are from the bottom-left indicator (for LEFT/RIGHT), and whether 4s precede/follow your 12s/9s in the intended direction.\n\n# GOAL\nFind/generate a key that MATCHES the key pattern shown at the EXIT, then navigate to the EXIT to finish the level.\nThere are 6 levels total. Complete all levels to WIN.\n\n# TILE MEANINGS (important ones)\n* 0 = white cell (used in key patterns)\n* 3 = walkable path / corridor marker (often outlines routes to key/exit)\n* 4 = WALL (solid). You cannot enter 4s.\n* 5 = EXIT indicator (presence of 5s marks/frames the exit area)\n* 8 = LIFE token (count lives as the number of 2×2 blocks of 8s)\n* 9 = blue cells (used in player lower body; also appear elsewhere in the map and in key logic)\n* 12 = orange cells (used in player upper body)\n* 15 = MOVE counter (number of 15s ≈ moves/energy left)\n\n# PLAYER (sprite + movement legality)\n* The player is an 8×8 sprite made ONLY of 12s (top two rows) over 9s (bottom six rows).\n  - Concretely: rows 0–1 (relative to the sprite) are all 12s; rows 2–7 are all 9s.\n  - Other scattered 9s on the board are NOT the player—only the exact 8×8 (2×8 of 12s stacked on 6×8 of 9s) is the player.\n* Movement rules:\n  - You may move only through non-4 cells (i.e., never overlap a 4 after a move).\n  - If any part of your 8×8 sprite would overlap a 4 in the target direction (including cases where 4s lie “under” 9s), that move is ILLEGAL.\n  - If your sprite is already touching 4s on a side, you cannot move further in that touching direction until you have clearance.\n  - Practically: navigate corridors “between the 4s”.\n\n# KEYS, EXIT, AND HOW TO FIND THEM\n* Bottom-left KEY INDICATOR (non-interactive):\n  - A small block of 0s and 9s COMPLETELY BOXED by 4s in the bottom-left of the entire grid.\n  - This is NOT reachable and NOT a gameplay area. It only shows your CURRENT selected key.\n* EXIT (the lock to open):\n  - Elsewhere on the map, the lock is the target 0/9 pattern you must match, adjacent to some 5s (the 5s need not fully surround it).\n  - You may leave the level only when your current key EXACTLY matches this lock’s 0/9 distribution.\n* KEY GENERATOR (interactive, how to generate keys):\n  - Look for a patch consisting of 0s and 9s that has a CLEAR path of 3s leading to it and around it, and is NOT bordered by 5s or boxed by 4s.\n  - When any part of your 8×8 player steps ONTO this patch, it GENERATES a NEW candidate key and updates the bottom-left indicator.\n  - Step OFF the patch and then back ON to generate yet another candidate key; repeat to cycle through the set of keys.\n  - Continue cycling until the bottom-left indicator EXACTLY matches the lock pattern at the exit (the same 0/9 layout adjacent to 5s).\n* Locating things quickly:\n  - Generator: 0/9 patch accessible via 3s, with only 3s around it (no 5s), is almost certainly the generator.\n  - Exit: a matching 0/9 pattern near 5s marks the lock/exit area.\n\n# HUD / PROGRESSION\n* Visual score on the second-to-last grid row (row 62): it contains several 4-cell “slots”.\n  - Slots made of 3s represent UNFINISHED levels.\n  - When a slot changes from 3s to another color, that level is COMPLETE.\n* Track remaining MOVES/ENERGY by counting tiles with value 15.\n* Track LIVES by counting distinct 2×2 blocks of 8s.\n\n# GENERAL NOTES\n* The grid is a bird’s-eye view.\n* If the grid does not change after an action, you likely attempted an illegal move into 4s.\n* Favor routes marked by 3s; use the generator (0/9 patch surrounded by 3s) to cycle keys; confirm the match by comparing the bottom-left indicator (boxed by 4s) to the 0/9 lock pattern found near 5s; then proceed to the exit.\n\n# EXAMPLE STRATEGY OBSERVATION\nThe 8×8 player (top rows 12s, bottom rows 9s) is touching 4s on the left, so LEFT is blocked. I see a 0/9 patch with only 3s around it to the right—that’s likely the generator. I should move RIGHT to step on/off it until the bottom-left indicator (boxed by 4s) matches the lock pattern I see near the 5s, then head to the exit.\n\n# TURN:\nCall exactly one action.\n\n"

    "content": "\n# CONTEXT:\nYou are an agent playing a dynamic game. Your objective is to\nWIN and avoid GAME_OVER while minimizing actions.\n\nOne action produces one Frame. One Frame is made of one or more sequential\nGrids. Each Grid is a matrix size INT<0,63> by INT<0,63> filled with\nINT<0,15> values. Each value represents a different color and usually implies a different object.\n\nYou are playing a game called LockSmith.\n\n# CONTROLS\n* RESET: start over\n* ACTION1: move up\n* ACTION2: move down\n* ACTION3: move left\n* ACTION4: move right\n* ACTION5/ACTION6: no-ops\n\n# ORIENTATION (read carefully)\n* The global frame is fixed: the bottom-left KEY INDICATOR is always at the bottom-left; the EXIT/lock is elsewhere.\n* ACTION1 (UP) moves you toward the area where 15s (move counters) are located; use this as a compass for “up.”\n* ACTION4 (RIGHT) increases your distance from the bottom-left key indicator; ACTION3 (LEFT) decreases it.\n* Legality checks with 4s (walls):\n  - RIGHT is ILLEGAL if any 4s lie immediately to the right (“after” in row order) of any 12/9 cells of your 8×8 player.\n  - LEFT is ILLEGAL if any 4s lie immediately to the left (“before” in row order) of any 12/9 cells of your 8×8 player.\n  - UP is ILLEGAL if any 4s lie directly above the topmost 12 row of your player.\n  - DOWN is ILLEGAL if any 4s lie directly below the bottommost 9 row of your player.\n* Always orient carefully before moving: check where the 15s lie (for UP), how far you are from the bottom-left indicator (for LEFT/RIGHT), and whether 4s precede/follow your 12s/9s in the intended direction.\n\n# GOAL\nFind/generate a key that MATCHES the key pattern shown at the EXIT, then navigate to the EXIT to finish the level.\nThere are 6 levels total. Complete all levels to WIN.\n\n# TILE MEANINGS (important ones)\n* 0 = white cell (used in key patterns)\n* 3 = walkable path / corridor marker (often outlines routes to key/exit)\n* 4 = WALL (solid). You cannot enter 4s.\n* 5 = EXIT indicator (presence of 5s marks/frames the exit area)\n* 8 = LIFE token (count lives as the number of 2×2 blocks of 8s)\n* 9 = blue cells (used in player lower body; also appear elsewhere in the map and in key logic)\n* 12 = orange cells (used in player upper body)\n* 15 = MOVE counter (number of 15s ≈ moves/energy left)\n\n# PLAYER (sprite + movement legality)\n* The player is an 8×8 sprite made ONLY of 12s (top two rows) over 9s (bottom six rows).\n  - Concretely: rows 0–1 (relative to the sprite) are all 12s; rows 2–7 are all 9s.\n  - Other scattered 9s on the board are NOT the player—only the exact 8×8 (2×8 of 12s stacked on 6×8 of 9s) is the player.\n* Movement rules:\n  - You may move only through non-4 cells (i.e., never overlap a 4 after a move).\n  - If any part of your 8×8 sprite would overlap a 4 in the target direction (including cases where 4s lie “under” 9s), that move is ILLEGAL.\n  - If your sprite is already touching 4s on a side, you cannot move further in that touching direction until you have clearance.\n  - Practically: navigate corridors “between the 4s”.\n\n# KEYS, EXIT, AND HOW TO FIND THEM\n* Bottom-left KEY INDICATOR (non-interactive):\n  - A small block of 0s and 9s COMPLETELY BOXED by 4s in the bottom-left of the entire grid.\n  - This is NOT reachable and NOT a gameplay area. It only shows your CURRENT selected key.\n* EXIT (the lock to open):\n  - Elsewhere on the map, the lock is the target 0/9 pattern you must match, adjacent to some 5s (the 5s need not fully surround it).\n  - You may leave the level only when your current key EXACTLY matches this lock’s 0/9 distribution.\n* KEY GENERATOR (interactive, how to generate keys):\n  - Look for a patch consisting of 0s and 9s that has a CLEAR path of 3s leading to it and around it, and is NOT bordered by 5s or boxed by 4s.\n  - When any part of your 8×8 player steps ONTO this patch, it GENERATES a NEW candidate key and updates the bottom-left indicator.\n  - Step OFF the patch and then back ON to generate yet another candidate key; repeat to cycle through the set of keys.\n  - Continue cycling until the bottom-left indicator EXACTLY matches the lock pattern at the exit (the same 0/9 layout adjacent to 5s).\n* Locating things quickly:\n  - Generator: 0/9 patch accessible via 3s, with only 3s around it (no 5s), is almost certainly the generator.\n  - Exit: a matching 0/9 pattern near 5s marks the lock/exit area.\n\n# HUD / PROGRESSION\n* Visual score on the second-to-last grid row (row 62): it contains several 4-cell “slots”.\n  - Slots made of 3s represent UNFINISHED levels.\n  - When a slot changes from 3s to another color, that level is COMPLETE.\n* Track remaining MOVES/ENERGY by counting tiles with value 15.\n* Track LIVES by counting distinct 2×2 blocks of 8s.\n\n# GENERAL NOTES\n* The grid is a bird’s-eye view.\n* If the grid does not change after an action, you likely attempted an illegal move into 4s.\n* Favor routes marked by 3s; use the generator (0/9 patch surrounded by 3s) to cycle keys; confirm the match by comparing the bottom-left indicator (boxed by 4s) to the 0/9 lock pattern found near 5s; then proceed to the exit.\n\n# EXAMPLE STRATEGY OBSERVATION\nThe 8×8 player (top rows 12s, bottom rows 9s) is touching 4s on the left, so LEFT is blocked. I see a 0/9 patch with only 3s around it to the right—that’s likely the generator. I should move RIGHT to step on/off it until the bottom-left indicator (boxed by 4s) matches the lock pattern I see near the 5s, then head to the exit.\n\n# TURN:\nCall exactly one action.\n\n"

    "content": "\n# CONTEXT:\nYou are an agent playing a dynamic game. Your objective is to\nWIN and avoid GAME_OVER while minimizing actions.\n\nOne action produces one Frame. One Frame is made of one or more sequential\nGrids. Each Grid is a matrix size INT<0,63> by INT<0,63> filled with\nINT<0,15> values. Each value represents a different color and usually implies a different object.\n\nYou are playing a game called LockSmith.\n\n# CONTROLS\n* RESET: start over\n* ACTION1: move up\n* ACTION2: move down\n* ACTION3: move left\n* ACTION4: move right\n* ACTION5/ACTION6: no-ops\n\n# ORIENTATION (read carefully)\n* The global frame is fixed: the bottom-left KEY INDICATOR is always at the bottom-left; the EXIT/lock is elsewhere.\n* ACTION1 (UP) moves you toward the area where 15s (move counters) are located; use this as a compass for “up.”\n* ACTION4 (RIGHT) increases your distance from the bottom-left key indicator; ACTION3 (LEFT) decreases it.\n* Legality checks with 4s (walls):\n  - RIGHT is ILLEGAL if any 4s lie immediately to the right (“after” in row order) of any 12/9 cells of your 8×8 player.\n  - LEFT is ILLEGAL if any 4s lie immediately to the left (“before” in row order) of any 12/9 cells of your 8×8 player.\n  - UP is ILLEGAL if any 4s lie directly above the topmost 12 row of your player.\n  - DOWN is ILLEGAL if any 4s lie directly below the bottommost 9 row of your player.\n* Always orient carefully before moving: check where the 15s lie (for UP), how far you are from the bottom-left indicator (for LEFT/RIGHT), and whether 4s precede/follow your 12s/9s in the intended direction.\n\n# GOAL\nFind/generate a key that MATCHES the key pattern shown at the EXIT, then navigate to the EXIT to finish the level.\nThere are 6 levels total. Complete all levels to WIN.\n\n# TILE MEANINGS (important ones)\n* 0 = white cell (used in key patterns)\n* 3 = walkable path / corridor marker (often outlines routes to key/exit)\n* 4 = WALL (solid). You cannot enter 4s.\n* 5 = EXIT indicator (presence of 5s marks/frames the exit area)\n* 8 = LIFE token (count lives as the number of 2×2 blocks of 8s)\n* 9 = blue cells (used in player lower body; also appear elsewhere in the map and in key logic)\n* 12 = orange cells (used in player upper body)\n* 15 = MOVE counter (number of 15s ≈ moves/energy left)\n\n# PLAYER (sprite + movement legality)\n* The player is an 8×8 sprite made ONLY of 12s (top two rows) over 9s (bottom six rows).\n  - Concretely: rows 0–1 (relative to the sprite) are all 12s; rows 2–7 are all 9s.\n  - Other scattered 9s on the board are NOT the player—only the exact 8×8 (2×8 of 12s stacked on 6×8 of 9s) is the player.\n* Movement rules:\n  - You may move only through non-4 cells (i.e., never overlap a 4 after a move).\n  - If any part of your 8×8 sprite would overlap a 4 in the target direction (including cases where 4s lie “under” 9s), that move is ILLEGAL.\n  - If your sprite is already touching 4s on a side, you cannot move further in that touching direction until you have clearance.\n  - Practically: navigate corridors “between the 4s”.\n\n# KEYS, EXIT, AND HOW TO FIND THEM\n* Bottom-left KEY INDICATOR (non-interactive):\n  - A small block of 0s and 9s COMPLETELY BOXED by 4s in the bottom-left of the entire grid.\n  - This is NOT reachable and NOT a gameplay area. It only shows your CURRENT selected key.\n* EXIT (the lock to open):\n  - Elsewhere on the map, the lock is the target 0/9 pattern you must match, adjacent to some 5s (the 5s need not fully surround it).\n  - You may leave the level only when your current key EXACTLY matches this lock’s 0/9 distribution.\n* KEY GENERATOR (interactive, how to generate keys):\n  - Look for a patch consisting of 0s and 9s that has a CLEAR path of 3s leading to it and around it, and is NOT bordered by 5s or boxed by 4s.\n  - When any part of your 8×8 player steps ONTO this patch, it GENERATES a NEW candidate key and updates the bottom-left indicator.\n  - Step OFF the patch and then back ON to generate yet another candidate key; repeat to cycle through the set of keys.\n  - Continue cycling until the bottom-left indicator EXACTLY matches the lock pattern at the exit (the same 0/9 layout adjacent to 5s).\n* Locating things quickly:\n  - Generator: 0/9 patch accessible via 3s, with only 3s around it (no 5s), is almost certainly the generator.\n  - Exit: a matching 0/9 pattern near 5s marks the lock/exit area.\n\n# HUD / PROGRESSION\n* Visual score on the second-to-last grid row (row 62): it contains several 4-cell “slots”.\n  - Slots made of 3s represent UNFINISHED levels.\n  - When a slot changes from 3s to another color, that level is COMPLETE.\n* Track remaining MOVES/ENERGY by counting tiles with value 15.\n* Track LIVES by counting distinct 2×2 blocks of 8s.\n\n# GENERAL NOTES\n* The grid is a bird’s-eye view.\n* If the grid does not change after an action, you likely attempted an illegal move into 4s.\n* Favor routes marked by 3s; use the generator (0/9 patch surrounded by 3s) to cycle keys; confirm the match by comparing the bottom-left indicator (boxed by 4s) to the 0/9 lock pattern found near 5s; then proceed to the exit.\n\n# EXAMPLE STRATEGY OBSERVATION\nThe 8×8 player (top rows 12s, bottom rows 9s) is touching 4s on the left, so LEFT is blocked. I see a 0/9 patch with only 3s around it to the right—that’s likely the generator. I should move RIGHT to step on/off it until the bottom-left indicator (boxed by 4s) matches the lock pattern I see near the 5s, then head to the exit.\n\n# TURN:\nCall exactly one action.\n\n"

    "content": "\n# CONTEXT:\nYou are an agent playing a dynamic game. Your objective is to\nWIN and avoid GAME_OVER while minimizing actions.\n\nOne action produces one Frame. One Frame is made of one or more sequential\nGrids. Each Grid is a matrix size INT<0,63> by INT<0,63> filled with\nINT<0,15> values. Each value represents a different color and usually implies a different object.\n\nYou are playing a game called LockSmith.\n\n# CONTROLS\n* RESET: start over\n* ACTION1: move up\n* ACTION2: move down\n* ACTION3: move left\n* ACTION4: move right\n* ACTION5/ACTION6: no-ops\n\n# ORIENTATION (read carefully)\n* The global frame is fixed: the bottom-left KEY INDICATOR is always at the bottom-left; the EXIT/lock is elsewhere.\n* ACTION1 (UP) moves you toward the area where 15s (move counters) are located; use this as a compass for “up.”\n* ACTION4 (RIGHT) increases your distance from the bottom-left key indicator; ACTION3 (LEFT) decreases it.\n* Legality checks with 4s (walls):\n  - RIGHT is ILLEGAL if any 4s lie immediately to the right (“after” in row order) of any 12/9 cells of your 8×8 player.\n  - LEFT is ILLEGAL if any 4s lie immediately to the left (“before” in row order) of any 12/9 cells of your 8×8 player.\n  - UP is ILLEGAL if any 4s lie directly above the topmost 12 row of your player.\n  - DOWN is ILLEGAL if any 4s lie directly below the bottommost 9 row of your player.\n* Always orient carefully before moving: check where the 15s lie (for UP), how far you are from the bottom-left indicator (for LEFT/RIGHT), and whether 4s precede/follow your 12s/9s in the intended direction.\n\n# GOAL\nFind/generate a key that MATCHES the key pattern shown at the EXIT, then navigate to the EXIT to finish the level.\nThere are 6 levels total. Complete all levels to WIN.\n\n# TILE MEANINGS (important ones)\n* 0 = white cell (used in key patterns)\n* 3 = walkable path / corridor marker (often outlines routes to key/exit)\n* 4 = WALL (solid). You cannot enter 4s.\n* 5 = EXIT indicator (presence of 5s marks/frames the exit area)\n* 8 = LIFE token (count lives as the number of 2×2 blocks of 8s)\n* 9 = blue cells (used in player lower body; also appear elsewhere in the map and in key logic)\n* 12 = orange cells (used in player upper body)\n* 15 = MOVE counter (number of 15s ≈ moves/energy left)\n\n# PLAYER (sprite + movement legality)\n* The player is an 8×8 sprite made ONLY of 12s (top two rows) over 9s (bottom six rows).\n  - Concretely: rows 0–1 (relative to the sprite) are all 12s; rows 2–7 are all 9s.\n  - Other scattered 9s on the board are NOT the player—only the exact 8×8 (2×8 of 12s stacked on 6×8 of 9s) is the player.\n* Movement rules:\n  - You may move only through non-4 cells (i.e., never overlap a 4 after a move).\n  - If any part of your 8×8 sprite would overlap a 4 in the target direction (including cases where 4s lie “under” 9s), that move is ILLEGAL.\n  - If your sprite is already touching 4s on a side, you cannot move further in that touching direction until you have clearance.\n  - Practically: navigate corridors “between the 4s”.\n\n# KEYS, EXIT, AND HOW TO FIND THEM\n* Bottom-left KEY INDICATOR (non-interactive):\n  - A small block of 0s and 9s COMPLETELY BOXED by 4s in the bottom-left of the entire grid.\n  - This is NOT reachable and NOT a gameplay area. It only shows your CURRENT selected key.\n* EXIT (the lock to open):\n  - Elsewhere on the map, the lock is the target 0/9 pattern you must match, adjacent to some 5s (the 5s need not fully surround it).\n  - You may leave the level only when your current key EXACTLY matches this lock’s 0/9 distribution.\n* KEY GENERATOR (interactive, how to generate keys):\n  - Look for a patch consisting of 0s and 9s that has a CLEAR path of 3s leading to it and around it, and is NOT bordered by 5s or boxed by 4s.\n  - When any part of your 8×8 player steps ONTO this patch, it GENERATES a NEW candidate key and updates the bottom-left indicator.\n  - Step OFF the patch and then back ON to generate yet another candidate key; repeat to cycle through the set of keys.\n  - Continue cycling until the bottom-left indicator EXACTLY matches the lock pattern at the exit (the same 0/9 layout adjacent to 5s).\n* Locating things quickly:\n  - Generator: 0/9 patch accessible via 3s, with only 3s around it (no 5s), is almost certainly the generator.\n  - Exit: a matching 0/9 pattern near 5s marks the lock/exit area.\n\n# HUD / PROGRESSION\n* Visual score on the second-to-last grid row (row 62): it contains several 4-cell “slots”.\n  - Slots made of 3s represent UNFINISHED levels.\n  - When a slot changes from 3s to another color, that level is COMPLETE.\n* Track remaining MOVES/ENERGY by counting tiles with value 15.\n* Track LIVES by counting distinct 2×2 blocks of 8s.\n\n# GENERAL NOTES\n* The grid is a bird’s-eye view.\n* If the grid does not change after an action, you likely attempted an illegal move into 4s.\n* Favor routes marked by 3s; use the generator (0/9 patch surrounded by 3s) to cycle keys; confirm the match by comparing the bottom-left indicator (boxed by 4s) to the 0/9 lock pattern found near 5s; then proceed to the exit.\n\n# EXAMPLE STRATEGY OBSERVATION\nThe 8×8 player (top rows 12s, bottom rows 9s) is touching 4s on the left, so LEFT is blocked. I see a 0/9 patch with only 3s around it to the right—that’s likely the generator. I should move RIGHT to step on/off it until the bottom-left indicator (boxed by 4s) matches the lock pattern I see near the 5s, then head to the exit.\n\n# TURN:\nCall exactly one action.\n\n"

    "content": "\n# CONTEXT:\nYou are an agent playing a dynamic game. Your objective is to\nWIN and avoid GAME_OVER while minimizing actions.\n\nOne action produces one Frame. One Frame is made of one or more sequential\nGrids. Each Grid is a matrix size INT<0,63> by INT<0,63> filled with\nINT<0,15> values. Each value represents a different color and usually implies a different object.\n\nYou are playing a game called LockSmith.\n\n# CONTROLS\n* RESET: start over\n* ACTION1: move up\n* ACTION2: move down\n* ACTION3: move left\n* ACTION4: move right\n* ACTION5/ACTION6: no-ops\n\n# ORIENTATION (read carefully)\n* The global frame is fixed: the bottom-left KEY INDICATOR is always at the bottom-left; the EXIT/lock is elsewhere.\n* ACTION1 (UP) moves you toward the area where 15s (move counters) are located; use this as a compass for “up.”\n* ACTION4 (RIGHT) increases your distance from the bottom-left key indicator; ACTION3 (LEFT) decreases it.\n* Legality checks with 4s (walls):\n  - RIGHT is ILLEGAL if any 4s lie immediately to the right (“after” in row order) of any 12/9 cells of your 8×8 player.\n  - LEFT is ILLEGAL if any 4s lie immediately to the left (“before” in row order) of any 12/9 cells of your 8×8 player.\n  - UP is ILLEGAL if any 4s lie directly above the topmost 12 row of your player.\n  - DOWN is ILLEGAL if any 4s lie directly below the bottommost 9 row of your player.\n* Always orient carefully before moving: check where the 15s lie (for UP), how far you are from the bottom-left indicator (for LEFT/RIGHT), and whether 4s precede/follow your 12s/9s in the intended direction.\n\n# GOAL\nFind/generate a key that MATCHES the key pattern shown at the EXIT, then navigate to the EXIT to finish the level.\nThere are 6 levels total. Complete all levels to WIN.\n\n# TILE MEANINGS (important ones)\n* 0 = white cell (used in key patterns)\n* 3 = walkable path / corridor marker (often outlines routes to key/exit)\n* 4 = WALL (solid). You cannot enter 4s.\n* 5 = EXIT indicator (presence of 5s marks/frames the exit area)\n* 8 = LIFE token (count lives as the number of 2×2 blocks of 8s)\n* 9 = blue cells (used in player lower body; also appear elsewhere in the map and in key logic)\n* 12 = orange cells (used in player upper body)\n* 15 = MOVE counter (number of 15s ≈ moves/energy left)\n\n# PLAYER (sprite + movement legality)\n* The player is an 8×8 sprite made ONLY of 12s (top two rows) over 9s (bottom six rows).\n  - Concretely: rows 0–1 (relative to the sprite) are all 12s; rows 2–7 are all 9s.\n  - Other scattered 9s on the board are NOT the player—only the exact 8×8 (2×8 of 12s stacked on 6×8 of 9s) is the player.\n* Movement rules:\n  - You may move only through non-4 cells (i.e., never overlap a 4 after a move).\n  - If any part of your 8×8 sprite would overlap a 4 in the target direction (including cases where 4s lie “under” 9s), that move is ILLEGAL.\n  - If your sprite is already touching 4s on a side, you cannot move further in that touching direction until you have clearance.\n  - Practically: navigate corridors “between the 4s”.\n\n# KEYS, EXIT, AND HOW TO FIND THEM\n* Bottom-left KEY INDICATOR (non-interactive):\n  - A small block of 0s and 9s COMPLETELY BOXED by 4s in the bottom-left of the entire grid.\n  - This is NOT reachable and NOT a gameplay area. It only shows your CURRENT selected key.\n* EXIT (the lock to open):\n  - Elsewhere on the map, the lock is the target 0/9 pattern you must match, adjacent to some 5s (the 5s need not fully surround it).\n  - You may leave the level only when your current key EXACTLY matches this lock’s 0/9 distribution.\n* KEY GENERATOR (interactive, how to generate keys):\n  - Look for a patch consisting of 0s and 9s that has a CLEAR path of 3s leading to it and around it, and is NOT bordered by 5s or boxed by 4s.\n  - When any part of your 8×8 player steps ONTO this patch, it GENERATES a NEW candidate key and updates the bottom-left indicator.\n  - Step OFF the patch and then back ON to generate yet another candidate key; repeat to cycle through the set of keys.\n  - Continue cycling until the bottom-left indicator EXACTLY matches the lock pattern at the exit (the same 0/9 layout adjacent to 5s).\n* Locating things quickly:\n  - Generator: 0/9 patch accessible via 3s, with only 3s around it (no 5s), is almost certainly the generator.\n  - Exit: a matching 0/9 pattern near 5s marks the lock/exit area.\n\n# HUD / PROGRESSION\n* Visual score on the second-to-last grid row (row 62): it contains several 4-cell “slots”.\n  - Slots made of 3s represent UNFINISHED levels.\n  - When a slot changes from 3s to another color, that level is COMPLETE.\n* Track remaining MOVES/ENERGY by counting tiles with value 15.\n* Track LIVES by counting distinct 2×2 blocks of 8s.\n\n# GENERAL NOTES\n* The grid is a bird’s-eye view.\n* If the grid does not change after an action, you likely attempted an illegal move into 4s.\n* Favor routes marked by 3s; use the generator (0/9 patch surrounded by 3s) to cycle keys; confirm the match by comparing the bottom-left indicator (boxed by 4s) to the 0/9 lock pattern found near 5s; then proceed to the exit.\n\n# EXAMPLE STRATEGY OBSERVATION\nThe 8×8 player (top rows 12s, bottom rows 9s) is touching 4s on the left, so LEFT is blocked. I see a 0/9 patch with only 3s around it to the right—that’s likely the generator. I should move RIGHT to step on/off it until the bottom-left indicator (boxed by 4s) matches the lock pattern I see near the 5s, then head to the exit.\n\n# TURN:\nCall exactly one action.\n\n"

    "content": "\n# CONTEXT:\nYou are an agent playing a dynamic game. Your objective is to\nWIN and avoid GAME_OVER while minimizing actions.\n\nOne action produces one Frame. One Frame is made of one or more sequential\nGrids. Each Grid is a matrix size INT<0,63> by INT<0,63> filled with\nINT<0,15> values. Each value represents a different color and usually implies a different object.\n\nYou are playing a game called LockSmith.\n\n# CONTROLS\n* RESET: start over\n* ACTION1: move up\n* ACTION2: move down\n* ACTION3: move left\n* ACTION4: move right\n* ACTION5/ACTION6: no-ops\n\n# ORIENTATION (read carefully)\n* The global frame is fixed: the bottom-left KEY INDICATOR is always at the bottom-left; the EXIT/lock is elsewhere.\n* ACTION1 (UP) moves you toward the area where 15s (move counters) are located; use this as a compass for “up.”\n* ACTION4 (RIGHT) increases your distance from the bottom-left key indicator; ACTION3 (LEFT) decreases it.\n* Legality checks with 4s (walls):\n  - RIGHT is ILLEGAL if any 4s lie immediately to the right (“after” in row order) of any 12/9 cells of your 8×8 player.\n  - LEFT is ILLEGAL if any 4s lie immediately to the left (“before” in row order) of any 12/9 cells of your 8×8 player.\n  - UP is ILLEGAL if any 4s lie directly above the topmost 12 row of your player.\n  - DOWN is ILLEGAL if any 4s lie directly below the bottommost 9 row of your player.\n* Always orient carefully before moving: check where the 15s lie (for UP), how far you are from the bottom-left indicator (for LEFT/RIGHT), and whether 4s precede/follow your 12s/9s in the intended direction.\n\n# GOAL\nFind/generate a key that MATCHES the key pattern shown at the EXIT, then navigate to the EXIT to finish the level.\nThere are 6 levels total. Complete all levels to WIN.\n\n# TILE MEANINGS (important ones)\n* 0 = white cell (used in key patterns)\n* 3 = walkable path / corridor marker (often outlines routes to key/exit)\n* 4 = WALL (solid). You cannot enter 4s.\n* 5 = EXIT indicator (presence of 5s marks/frames the exit area)\n* 8 = LIFE token (count lives as the number of 2×2 blocks of 8s)\n* 9 = blue cells (used in player lower body; also appear elsewhere in the map and in key logic)\n* 12 = orange cells (used in player upper body)\n* 15 = MOVE counter (number of 15s ≈ moves/energy left)\n\n# PLAYER (sprite + movement legality)\n* The player is an 8×8 sprite made ONLY of 12s (top two rows) over 9s (bottom six rows).\n  - Concretely: rows 0–1 (relative to the sprite) are all 12s; rows 2–7 are all 9s.\n  - Other scattered 9s on the board are NOT the player—only the exact 8×8 (2×8 of 12s stacked on 6×8 of 9s) is the player.\n* Movement rules:\n  - You may move only through non-4 cells (i.e., never overlap a 4 after a move).\n  - If any part of your 8×8 sprite would overlap a 4 in the target direction (including cases where 4s lie “under” 9s), that move is ILLEGAL.\n  - If your sprite is already touching 4s on a side, you cannot move further in that touching direction until you have clearance.\n  - Practically: navigate corridors “between the 4s”.\n\n# KEYS, EXIT, AND HOW TO FIND THEM\n* Bottom-left KEY INDICATOR (non-interactive):\n  - A small block of 0s and 9s COMPLETELY BOXED by 4s in the bottom-left of the entire grid.\n  - This is NOT reachable and NOT a gameplay area. It only shows your CURRENT selected key.\n* EXIT (the lock to open):\n  - Elsewhere on the map, the lock is the target 0/9 pattern you must match, adjacent to some 5s (the 5s need not fully surround it).\n  - You may leave the level only when your current key EXACTLY matches this lock’s 0/9 distribution.\n* KEY GENERATOR (interactive, how to generate keys):\n  - Look for a patch consisting of 0s and 9s that has a CLEAR path of 3s leading to it and around it, and is NOT bordered by 5s or boxed by 4s.\n  - When any part of your 8×8 player steps ONTO this patch, it GENERATES a NEW candidate key and updates the bottom-left indicator.\n  - Step OFF the patch and then back ON to generate yet another candidate key; repeat to cycle through the set of keys.\n  - Continue cycling until the bottom-left indicator EXACTLY matches the lock pattern at the exit (the same 0/9 layout adjacent to 5s).\n* Locating things quickly:\n  - Generator: 0/9 patch accessible via 3s, with only 3s around it (no 5s), is almost certainly the generator.\n  - Exit: a matching 0/9 pattern near 5s marks the lock/exit area.\n\n# HUD / PROGRESSION\n* Visual score on the second-to-last grid row (row 62): it contains several 4-cell “slots”.\n  - Slots made of 3s represent UNFINISHED levels.\n  - When a slot changes from 3s to another color, that level is COMPLETE.\n* Track remaining MOVES/ENERGY by counting tiles with value 15.\n* Track LIVES by counting distinct 2×2 blocks of 8s.\n\n# GENERAL NOTES\n* The grid is a bird’s-eye view.\n* If the grid does not change after an action, you likely attempted an illegal move into 4s.\n* Favor routes marked by 3s; use the generator (0/9 patch surrounded by 3s) to cycle keys; confirm the match by comparing the bottom-left indicator (boxed by 4s) to the 0/9 lock pattern found near 5s; then proceed to the exit.\n\n# EXAMPLE STRATEGY OBSERVATION\nThe 8×8 player (top rows 12s, bottom rows 9s) is touching 4s on the left, so LEFT is blocked. I see a 0/9 patch with only 3s around it to the right—that’s likely the generator. I should move RIGHT to step on/off it until the bottom-left indicator (boxed by 4s) matches the lock pattern I see near the 5s, then head to the exit.\n\n# TURN:\nCall exactly one action.\n\n"

    "content": "\n# CONTEXT:\nYou are an agent playing a dynamic game. Your objective is to\nWIN and avoid GAME_OVER while minimizing actions.\n\nOne action produces one Frame. One Frame is made of one or more sequential\nGrids. Each Grid is a matrix size INT<0,63> by INT<0,63> filled with\nINT<0,15> values. Each value represents a different color and usually implies a different object.\n\nYou are playing a game called LockSmith.\n\n# CONTROLS\n* RESET: start over\n* ACTION1: move up\n* ACTION2: move down\n* ACTION3: move left\n* ACTION4: move right\n* ACTION5/ACTION6: no-ops\n\n# ORIENTATION (read carefully)\n* The global frame is fixed: the bottom-left KEY INDICATOR is always at the bottom-left; the EXIT/lock is elsewhere.\n* ACTION1 (UP) moves you toward the area where 15s (move counters) are located; use this as a compass for “up.”\n* ACTION4 (RIGHT) increases your distance from the bottom-left key indicator; ACTION3 (LEFT) decreases it.\n* Legality checks with 4s (walls):\n  - RIGHT is ILLEGAL if any 4s lie immediately to the right (“after” in row order) of any 12/9 cells of your 8×8 player.\n  - LEFT is ILLEGAL if any 4s lie immediately to the left (“before” in row order) of any 12/9 cells of your 8×8 player.\n  - UP is ILLEGAL if any 4s lie directly above the topmost 12 row of your player.\n  - DOWN is ILLEGAL if any 4s lie directly below the bottommost 9 row of your player.\n* Always orient carefully before moving: check where the 15s lie (for UP), how far you are from the bottom-left indicator (for LEFT/RIGHT), and whether 4s precede/follow your 12s/9s in the intended direction.\n\n# GOAL\nFind/generate a key that MATCHES the key pattern shown at the EXIT, then navigate to the EXIT to finish the level.\nThere are 6 levels total. Complete all levels to WIN.\n\n# TILE MEANINGS (important ones)\n* 0 = white cell (used in key patterns)\n* 3 = walkable path / corridor marker (often outlines routes to key/exit)\n* 4 = WALL (solid). You cannot enter 4s.\n* 5 = EXIT indicator (presence of 5s marks/frames the exit area)\n* 8 = LIFE token (count lives as the number of 2×2 blocks of 8s)\n* 9 = blue cells (used in player lower body; also appear elsewhere in the map and in key logic)\n* 12 = orange cells (used in player upper body)\n* 15 = MOVE counter (number of 15s ≈ moves/energy left)\n\n# PLAYER (sprite + movement legality)\n* The player is an 8×8 sprite made ONLY of 12s (top two rows) over 9s (bottom six rows).\n  - Concretely: rows 0–1 (relative to the sprite) are all 12s; rows 2–7 are all 9s.\n  - Other scattered 9s on the board are NOT the player—only the exact 8×8 (2×8 of 12s stacked on 6×8 of 9s) is the player.\n* Movement rules:\n  - You may move only through non-4 cells (i.e., never overlap a 4 after a move).\n  - If any part of your 8×8 sprite would overlap a 4 in the target direction (including cases where 4s lie “under” 9s), that move is ILLEGAL.\n  - If your sprite is already touching 4s on a side, you cannot move further in that touching direction until you have clearance.\n  - Practically: navigate corridors “between the 4s”.\n\n# KEYS, EXIT, AND HOW TO FIND THEM\n* Bottom-left KEY INDICATOR (non-interactive):\n  - A small block of 0s and 9s COMPLETELY BOXED by 4s in the bottom-left of the entire grid.\n  - This is NOT reachable and NOT a gameplay area. It only shows your CURRENT selected key.\n* EXIT (the lock to open):\n  - Elsewhere on the map, the lock is the target 0/9 pattern you must match, adjacent to some 5s (the 5s need not fully surround it).\n  - You may leave the level only when your current key EXACTLY matches this lock’s 0/9 distribution.\n* KEY GENERATOR (interactive, how to generate keys):\n  - Look for a patch consisting of 0s and 9s that has a CLEAR path of 3s leading to it and around it, and is NOT bordered by 5s or boxed by 4s.\n  - When any part of your 8×8 player steps ONTO this patch, it GENERATES a NEW candidate key and updates the bottom-left indicator.\n  - Step OFF the patch and then back ON to generate yet another candidate key; repeat to cycle through the set of keys.\n  - Continue cycling until the bottom-left indicator EXACTLY matches the lock pattern at the exit (the same 0/9 layout adjacent to 5s).\n* Locating things quickly:\n  - Generator: 0/9 patch accessible via 3s, with only 3s around it (no 5s), is almost certainly the generator.\n  - Exit: a matching 0/9 pattern near 5s marks the lock/exit area.\n\n# HUD / PROGRESSION\n* Visual score on the second-to-last grid row (row 62): it contains several 4-cell “slots”.\n  - Slots made of 3s represent UNFINISHED levels.\n  - When a slot changes from 3s to another color, that level is COMPLETE.\n* Track remaining MOVES/ENERGY by counting tiles with value 15.\n* Track LIVES by counting distinct 2×2 blocks of 8s.\n\n# GENERAL NOTES\n* The grid is a bird’s-eye view.\n* If the grid does not change after an action, you likely attempted an illegal move into 4s.\n* Favor routes marked by 3s; use the generator (0/9 patch surrounded by 3s) to cycle keys; confirm the match by comparing the bottom-left indicator (boxed by 4s) to the 0/9 lock pattern found near 5s; then proceed to the exit.\n\n# EXAMPLE STRATEGY OBSERVATION\nThe 8×8 player (top rows 12s, bottom rows 9s) is touching 4s on the left, so LEFT is blocked. I see a 0/9 patch with only 3s around it to the right—that’s likely the generator. I should move RIGHT to step on/off it until the bottom-left indicator (boxed by 4s) matches the lock pattern I see near the 5s, then head to the exit.\n\n# TURN:\nCall exactly one action.\n\n"

    "content": "\n# CONTEXT:\nYou are an agent playing a dynamic game. Your objective is to\nWIN and avoid GAME_OVER while minimizing actions.\n\nOne action produces one Frame. One Frame is made of one or more sequential\nGrids. Each Grid is a matrix size INT<0,63> by INT<0,63> filled with\nINT<0,15> values. Each value represents a different color and usually implies a different object.\n\nYou are playing a game called LockSmith.\n\n# CONTROLS\n* RESET: start over\n* ACTION1: move up\n* ACTION2: move down\n* ACTION3: move left\n* ACTION4: move right\n* ACTION5/ACTION6: no-ops\n\n# ORIENTATION (read carefully)\n* The global frame is fixed: the bottom-left KEY INDICATOR is always at the bottom-left; the EXIT/lock is elsewhere.\n* ACTION1 (UP) moves you toward the area where 15s (move counters) are located; use this as a compass for “up.”\n* ACTION4 (RIGHT) increases your distance from the bottom-left key indicator; ACTION3 (LEFT) decreases it.\n* Legality checks with 4s (walls):\n  - RIGHT is ILLEGAL if any 4s lie immediately to the right (“after” in row order) of any 12/9 cells of your 8×8 player.\n  - LEFT is ILLEGAL if any 4s lie immediately to the left (“before” in row order) of any 12/9 cells of your 8×8 player.\n  - UP is ILLEGAL if any 4s lie directly above the topmost 12 row of your player.\n  - DOWN is ILLEGAL if any 4s lie directly below the bottommost 9 row of your player.\n* Always orient carefully before moving: check where the 15s lie (for UP), how far you are from the bottom-left indicator (for LEFT/RIGHT), and whether 4s precede/follow your 12s/9s in the intended direction.\n\n# GOAL\nFind/generate a key that MATCHES the key pattern shown at the EXIT, then navigate to the EXIT to finish the level.\nThere are 6 levels total. Complete all levels to WIN.\n\n# TILE MEANINGS (important ones)\n* 0 = white cell (used in key patterns)\n* 3 = walkable path / corridor marker (often outlines routes to key/exit)\n* 4 = WALL (solid). You cannot enter 4s.\n* 5 = EXIT indicator (presence of 5s marks/frames the exit area)\n* 8 = LIFE token (count lives as the number of 2×2 blocks of 8s)\n* 9 = blue cells (used in player lower body; also appear elsewhere in the map and in key logic)\n* 12 = orange cells (used in player upper body)\n* 15 = MOVE counter (number of 15s ≈ moves/energy left)\n\n# PLAYER (sprite + movement legality)\n* The player is an 8×8 sprite made ONLY of 12s (top two rows) over 9s (bottom six rows).\n  - Concretely: rows 0–1 (relative to the sprite) are all 12s; rows 2–7 are all 9s.\n  - Other scattered 9s on the board are NOT the player—only the exact 8×8 (2×8 of 12s stacked on 6×8 of 9s) is the player.\n* Movement rules:\n  - You may move only through non-4 cells (i.e., never overlap a 4 after a move).\n  - If any part of your 8×8 sprite would overlap a 4 in the target direction (including cases where 4s lie “under” 9s), that move is ILLEGAL.\n  - If your sprite is already touching 4s on a side, you cannot move further in that touching direction until you have clearance.\n  - Practically: navigate corridors “between the 4s”.\n\n# KEYS, EXIT, AND HOW TO FIND THEM\n* Bottom-left KEY INDICATOR (non-interactive):\n  - A small block of 0s and 9s COMPLETELY BOXED by 4s in the bottom-left of the entire grid.\n  - This is NOT reachable and NOT a gameplay area. It only shows your CURRENT selected key.\n* EXIT (the lock to open):\n  - Elsewhere on the map, the lock is the target 0/9 pattern you must match, adjacent to some 5s (the 5s need not fully surround it).\n  - You may leave the level only when your current key EXACTLY matches this lock’s 0/9 distribution.\n* KEY GENERATOR (interactive, how to generate keys):\n  - Look for a patch consisting of 0s and 9s that has a CLEAR path of 3s leading to it and around it, and is NOT bordered by 5s or boxed by 4s.\n  - When any part of your 8×8 player steps ONTO this patch, it GENERATES a NEW candidate key and updates the bottom-left indicator.\n  - Step OFF the patch and then back ON to generate yet another candidate key; repeat to cycle through the set of keys.\n  - Continue cycling until the bottom-left indicator EXACTLY matches the lock pattern at the exit (the same 0/9 layout adjacent to 5s).\n* Locating things quickly:\n  - Generator: 0/9 patch accessible via 3s, with only 3s around it (no 5s), is almost certainly the generator.\n  - Exit: a matching 0/9 pattern near 5s marks the lock/exit area.\n\n# HUD / PROGRESSION\n* Visual score on the second-to-last grid row (row 62): it contains several 4-cell “slots”.\n  - Slots made of 3s represent UNFINISHED levels.\n  - When a slot changes from 3s to another color, that level is COMPLETE.\n* Track remaining MOVES/ENERGY by counting tiles with value 15.\n* Track LIVES by counting distinct 2×2 blocks of 8s.\n\n# GENERAL NOTES\n* The grid is a bird’s-eye view.\n* If the grid does not change after an action, you likely attempted an illegal move into 4s.\n* Favor routes marked by 3s; use the generator (0/9 patch surrounded by 3s) to cycle keys; confirm the match by comparing the bottom-left indicator (boxed by 4s) to the 0/9 lock pattern found near 5s; then proceed to the exit.\n\n# EXAMPLE STRATEGY OBSERVATION\nThe 8×8 player (top rows 12s, bottom rows 9s) is touching 4s on the left, so LEFT is blocked. I see a 0/9 patch with only 3s around it to the right—that’s likely the generator. I should move RIGHT to step on/off it until the bottom-left indicator (boxed by 4s) matches the lock pattern I see near the 5s, then head to the exit.\n\n# TURN:\nCall exactly one action.\n\n"

    "content": "\n# CONTEXT:\nYou are an agent playing a dynamic game. Your objective is to\nWIN and avoid GAME_OVER while minimizing actions.\n\nOne action produces one Frame. One Frame is made of one or more sequential\nGrids. Each Grid is a matrix size INT<0,63> by INT<0,63> filled with\nINT<0,15> values. Each value represents a different color and usually implies a different object.\n\nYou are playing a game called LockSmith.\n\n# CONTROLS\n* RESET: start over\n* ACTION1: move up\n* ACTION2: move down\n* ACTION3: move left\n* ACTION4: move right\n* ACTION5/ACTION6: no-ops\n\n# ORIENTATION (read carefully)\n* The global frame is fixed: the bottom-left KEY INDICATOR is always at the bottom-left; the EXIT/lock is elsewhere.\n* ACTION1 (UP) moves you toward the area where 15s (move counters) are located; use this as a compass for “up.”\n* ACTION4 (RIGHT) increases your distance from the bottom-left key indicator; ACTION3 (LEFT) decreases it.\n* Legality checks with 4s (walls):\n  - RIGHT is ILLEGAL if any 4s lie immediately to the right (“after” in row order) of any 12/9 cells of your 8×8 player.\n  - LEFT is ILLEGAL if any 4s lie immediately to the left (“before” in row order) of any 12/9 cells of your 8×8 player.\n  - UP is ILLEGAL if any 4s lie directly above the topmost 12 row of your player.\n  - DOWN is ILLEGAL if any 4s lie directly below the bottommost 9 row of your player.\n* Always orient carefully before moving: check where the 15s lie (for UP), how far you are from the bottom-left indicator (for LEFT/RIGHT), and whether 4s precede/follow your 12s/9s in the intended direction.\n\n# GOAL\nFind/generate a key that MATCHES the key pattern shown at the EXIT, then navigate to the EXIT to finish the level.\nThere are 6 levels total. Complete all levels to WIN.\n\n# TILE MEANINGS (important ones)\n* 0 = white cell (used in key patterns)\n* 3 = walkable path / corridor marker (often outlines routes to key/exit)\n* 4 = WALL (solid). You cannot enter 4s.\n* 5 = EXIT indicator (presence of 5s marks/frames the exit area)\n* 8 = LIFE token (count lives as the number of 2×2 blocks of 8s)\n* 9 = blue cells (used in player lower body; also appear elsewhere in the map and in key logic)\n* 12 = orange cells (used in player upper body)\n* 15 = MOVE counter (number of 15s ≈ moves/energy left)\n\n# PLAYER (sprite + movement legality)\n* The player is an 8×8 sprite made ONLY of 12s (top two rows) over 9s (bottom six rows).\n  - Concretely: rows 0–1 (relative to the sprite) are all 12s; rows 2–7 are all 9s.\n  - Other scattered 9s on the board are NOT the player—only the exact 8×8 (2×8 of 12s stacked on 6×8 of 9s) is the player.\n* Movement rules:\n  - You may move only through non-4 cells (i.e., never overlap a 4 after a move).\n  - If any part of your 8×8 sprite would overlap a 4 in the target direction (including cases where 4s lie “under” 9s), that move is ILLEGAL.\n  - If your sprite is already touching 4s on a side, you cannot move further in that touching direction until you have clearance.\n  - Practically: navigate corridors “between the 4s”.\n\n# KEYS, EXIT, AND HOW TO FIND THEM\n* Bottom-left KEY INDICATOR (non-interactive):\n  - A small block of 0s and 9s COMPLETELY BOXED by 4s in the bottom-left of the entire grid.\n  - This is NOT reachable and NOT a gameplay area. It only shows your CURRENT selected key.\n* EXIT (the lock to open):\n  - Elsewhere on the map, the lock is the target 0/9 pattern you must match, adjacent to some 5s (the 5s need not fully surround it).\n  - You may leave the level only when your current key EXACTLY matches this lock’s 0/9 distribution.\n* KEY GENERATOR (interactive, how to generate keys):\n  - Look for a patch consisting of 0s and 9s that has a CLEAR path of 3s leading to it and around it, and is NOT bordered by 5s or boxed by 4s.\n  - When any part of your 8×8 player steps ONTO this patch, it GENERATES a NEW candidate key and updates the bottom-left indicator.\n  - Step OFF the patch and then back ON to generate yet another candidate key; repeat to cycle through the set of keys.\n  - Continue cycling until the bottom-left indicator EXACTLY matches the lock pattern at the exit (the same 0/9 layout adjacent to 5s).\n* Locating things quickly:\n  - Generator: 0/9 patch accessible via 3s, with only 3s around it (no 5s), is almost certainly the generator.\n  - Exit: a matching 0/9 pattern near 5s marks the lock/exit area.\n\n# HUD / PROGRESSION\n* Visual score on the second-to-last grid row (row 62): it contains several 4-cell “slots”.\n  - Slots made of 3s represent UNFINISHED levels.\n  - When a slot changes from 3s to another color, that level is COMPLETE.\n* Track remaining MOVES/ENERGY by counting tiles with value 15.\n* Track LIVES by counting distinct 2×2 blocks of 8s.\n\n# GENERAL NOTES\n* The grid is a bird’s-eye view.\n* If the grid does not change after an action, you likely attempted an illegal move into 4s.\n* Favor routes marked by 3s; use the generator (0/9 patch surrounded by 3s) to cycle keys; confirm the match by comparing the bottom-left indicator (boxed by 4s) to the 0/9 lock pattern found near 5s; then proceed to the exit.\n\n# EXAMPLE STRATEGY OBSERVATION\nThe 8×8 player (top rows 12s, bottom rows 9s) is touching 4s on the left, so LEFT is blocked. I see a 0/9 patch with only 3s around it to the right—that’s likely the generator. I should move RIGHT to step on/off it until the bottom-left indicator (boxed by 4s) matches the lock pattern I see near the 5s, then head to the exit.\n\n# TURN:\nCall exactly one action.\n\n"

Each value represents a different color and usually implies a different object.\n\nYou are playing a game called LockSmith.\n\n# CONTROLS\n* RESET: start over\n* ACTION1: move up\n* ACTION2: move down\n* ACTION3: move left\n* ACTION4: move right\n* ACTION5/ACTION6: no-ops\n\n# ORIENTATION (read carefully)\n* The global frame is fixed: the bottom-left KEY INDICATOR is always at the bottom-left; the EXIT/lock is elsewhere.\n* ACTION1 (UP) moves you toward the area where 15s (move counters) are located; use this as a compass for “up.”\n* ACTION4 (RIGHT) increases your distance from the bottom-left key indicator; ACTION3 (LEFT) decreases it.\n* Legality checks with 4s (walls):\n  - RIGHT is ILLEGAL if any 4s lie immediately to the right (“after” in row order) of any 12/9 cells of your 8×8 player.\n  - LEFT is ILLEGAL if any 4s lie immediately to the left (“before” in row order) of any 12/9 cells of your 8×8 player.\n  - UP is ILLEGAL if any 4s lie directly above the topmost 12 row of your player.\n  - DOWN is ILLEGAL if any 4s lie directly below the bottommost 9 row of your player.\n* Always orient carefully before moving: check where the 15s lie (for UP), how far you are from the bottom-left indicator (for LEFT/RIGHT), and whether 4s precede/follow your 12s/9s in the intended direction.\n\n# GOAL\nFind/generate a key that MATCHES the key pattern shown at the EXIT, then navigate to the EXIT to finish the level.\nThere are 6 levels total. Complete all levels to WIN.\n\n# TILE MEANINGS (important ones)\n* 0 = white cell (used in key patterns)\n* 3 = walkable path / corridor marker (often outlines routes to key/exit)\n* 4 = WALL (solid). You cannot enter 4s.\n* 5 = EXIT indicator (presence of 5s marks/frames the exit area)\n* 8 = LIFE token (count lives as the number of 2×2 blocks of 8s)\n* 9 = blue cells (used in player lower body; also appear elsewhere in the map and in key logic)\n* 12 = orange cells (used in player upper body)\n* 15 = MOVE counter (number of 15s ≈ moves/energy left)\n\n# PLAYER (sprite + movement legality)\n* The player is an 8×8 sprite made ONLY of 12s (top two rows) over 9s (bottom six rows).\n  - Concretely: rows 0–1 (relative to the sprite) are all 12s; rows 2–7 are all 9s.\n  - Other scattered 9s on the board are NOT the player—only the exact 8×8 (2×8 of 12s stacked on 6×8 of 9s) is the player.\n* Movement rules:\n  - You may move only through non-4 cells (i.e., never overlap a 4 after a move).\n  - If any part of your 8×8 sprite would overlap a 4 in the target direction (including cases where 4s lie “under” 9s), that move is ILLEGAL.\n  - If your sprite is already touching 4s on a side, you cannot move further in that touching direction until you have clearance.\n  - Practically: navigate corridors “between the 4s”.\n\n# KEYS, EXIT, AND HOW TO FIND THEM\n* Bottom-left KEY INDICATOR (non-interactive):\n  - A small block of 0s and 9s COMPLETELY BOXED by 4s in the bottom-left of the entire grid.\n  - This is NOT reachable and NOT a gameplay area. It only shows your CURRENT selected key.\n* EXIT (the lock to open):\n  - Elsewhere on the map, the lock is the target 0/9 pattern you must match, adjacent to some 5s (the 5s need not fully surround it).\n  - You may leave the level only when your current key EXACTLY matches this lock’s 0/9 distribution.\n* KEY GENERATOR (interactive, how to generate keys):\n  - Look for a patch consisting of 0s and 9s that has a CLEAR path of 3s leading to it and around it, and is NOT bordered by 5s or boxed by 4s.\n  - When any part of your 8×8 player steps ONTO this patch, it GENERATES a NEW candidate key and updates the bottom-left indicator.\n  - Step OFF the patch and then back ON to generate yet another candidate key; repeat to cycle through the set of keys.\n  - Continue cycling until the bottom-left indicator EXACTLY matches the lock pattern at the exit (the same 0/9 layout adjacent to 5s).\n* Locating things quickly:\n  - Generator: 0/9 patch accessible via 3s, with only 3s around it (no 5s), is almost certainly the generator.\n  - Exit: a matching 0/9 pattern near 5s marks the lock/exit area.\n\n# HUD / PROGRESSION\n* Visual score on the second-to-last grid row (row 62): it contains several 4-cell “slots”.\n  - Slots made of 3s represent UNFINISHED levels.\n  - When a slot changes from 3s to another color, that level is COMPLETE.\n* Track remaining MOVES/ENERGY by counting tiles with value 15.\n* Track LIVES by counting distinct 2×2 blocks of 8s.\n\n# GENERAL NOTES\n* The grid is a bird’s-eye view.\n* If the grid does not change after an action, you likely attempted an illegal move into 4s.\n* Favor routes marked by 3s; use the generator (0/9 patch surrounded by 3s) to cycle keys; confirm the match by comparing the bottom-left indicator (boxed by 4s) to the 0/9 lock pattern found near 5s; then proceed to the exit.\n\n# EXAMPLE STRATEGY OBSERVATION\nThe 8×8 player (top rows 12s, bottom rows 9s) is touching 4s on the left, so LEFT is blocked. I see a 0/9 patch with only 3s around it to the right—that’s likely the generator. I should move RIGHT to step on/off it until the bottom-left indicator (boxed by 4s) matches the lock pattern I see near the 5s, then head to the exit.\n\n# TURN:\nCall exactly one action.\n\n"

    "content": "\n# CONTEXT:\nYou are an agent playing a dynamic game. Your objective is to\nWIN and avoid GAME_OVER while minimizing actions.\n\nOne action produces one Frame. One Frame is made of one or more sequential\nGrids. Each Grid is a matrix size INT<0,63> by INT<0,63> filled with\nINT<0,15> values. Each value represents a different color and usually implies a different object.\n\nYou are playing a game called LockSmith.\n\n# CONTROLS\n* RESET: start over\n* ACTION1: move up\n* ACTION2: move down\n* ACTION3: move left\n* ACTION4: move right\n* ACTION5/ACTION6: no-ops\n\n# ORIENTATION (read carefully)\n* The global frame is fixed: the bottom-left KEY INDICATOR is always at the bottom-left; the EXIT/lock is elsewhere.\n* ACTION1 (UP) moves you toward the area where 15s (move counters) are located; use this as a compass for “up.”\n* ACTION4 (RIGHT) increases your distance from the bottom-left key indicator; ACTION3 (LEFT) decreases it.\n* Legality checks with 4s (walls):\n  - RIGHT is ILLEGAL if any 4s lie immediately to the right (“after” in row order) of any 12/9 cells of your 8×8 player.\n  - LEFT is ILLEGAL if any 4s lie immediately to the left (“before” in row order) of any 12/9 cells of your 8×8 player.\n  - UP is ILLEGAL if any 4s lie directly above the topmost 12 row of your player.\n  - DOWN is ILLEGAL if any 4s lie directly below the bottommost 9 row of your player.\n* Always orient carefully before moving: check where the 15s lie (for UP), how far you are from the bottom-left indicator (for LEFT/RIGHT), and whether 4s precede/follow your 12s/9s in the intended direction.\n\n# GOAL\nFind/generate a key that MATCHES the key pattern shown at the EXIT, then navigate to the EXIT to finish the level.\nThere are 6 levels total. Complete all levels to WIN.\n\n# TILE MEANINGS (important ones)\n* 0 = white cell (used in key patterns)\n* 3 = walkable path / corridor marker (often outlines routes to key/exit)\n* 4 = WALL (solid). You cannot enter 4s.\n* 5 = EXIT indicator (presence of 5s marks/frames the exit area)\n* 8 = LIFE token (count lives as the number of 2×2 blocks of 8s)\n* 9 = blue cells (used in player lower body; also appear elsewhere in the map and in key logic)\n* 12 = orange cells (used in player upper body)\n* 15 = MOVE counter (number of 15s ≈ moves/energy left)\n\n# PLAYER (sprite + movement legality)\n* The player is an 8×8 sprite made ONLY of 12s (top two rows) over 9s (bottom six rows).\n  - Concretely: rows 0–1 (relative to the sprite) are all 12s; rows 2–7 are all 9s.\n  - Other scattered 9s on the board are NOT the player—only the exact 8×8 (2×8 of 12s stacked on 6×8 of 9s) is the player.\n* Movement rules:\n  - You may move only through non-4 cells (i.e., never overlap a 4 after a move).\n  - If any part of your 8×8 sprite would overlap a 4 in the target direction (including cases where 4s lie “under” 9s), that move is ILLEGAL.\n  - If your sprite is already touching 4s on a side, you cannot move further in that touching direction until you have clearance.\n  - Practically: navigate corridors “between the 4s”.\n\n# KEYS, EXIT, AND HOW TO FIND THEM\n* Bottom-left KEY INDICATOR (non-interactive):\n  - A small block of 0s and 9s COMPLETELY BOXED by 4s in the bottom-left of the entire grid.\n  - This is NOT reachable and NOT a gameplay area. It only shows your CURRENT selected key.\n* EXIT (the lock to open):\n  - Elsewhere on the map, the lock is the target 0/9 pattern you must match, adjacent to some 5s (the 5s need not fully surround it).\n  - You may leave the level only when your current key EXACTLY matches this lock’s 0/9 distribution.\n* KEY GENERATOR (interactive, how to generate keys):\n  - Look for a patch consisting of 0s and 9s that has a CLEAR path of 3s leading to it and around it, and is NOT bordered by 5s or boxed by 4s.\n  - When any part of your 8×8 player steps ONTO this patch, it GENERATES a NEW candidate key and updates the bottom-left indicator.\n  - Step OFF the patch and then back ON to generate yet another candidate key; repeat to cycle through the set of keys.\n  - Continue cycling until the bottom-left indicator EXACTLY matches the lock pattern at the exit (the same 0/9 layout adjacent to 5s).\n* Locating things quickly:\n  - Generator: 0/9 patch accessible via 3s, with only 3s around it (no 5s), is almost certainly the generator.\n  - Exit: a matching 0/9 pattern near 5s marks the lock/exit area.\n\n# HUD / PROGRESSION\n* Visual score on the second-to-last grid row (row 62): it contains several 4-cell “slots”.\n  - Slots made of 3s represent UNFINISHED levels.\n  - When a slot changes from 3s to another color, that level is COMPLETE.\n* Track remaining MOVES/ENERGY by counting tiles with value 15.\n* Track LIVES by counting distinct 2×2 blocks of 8s.\n\n# GENERAL NOTES\n* The grid is a bird’s-eye view.\n* If the grid does not change after an action, you likely attempted an illegal move into 4s.\n* Favor routes marked by 3s; use the generator (0/9 patch surrounded by 3s) to cycle keys; confirm the match by comparing the bottom-left indicator (boxed by 4s) to the 0/9 lock pattern found near 5s; then proceed to the exit.\n\n# EXAMPLE STRATEGY OBSERVATION\nThe 8×8 player (top rows 12s, bottom rows 9s) is touching 4s on the left, so LEFT is blocked. I see a 0/9 patch with only 3s around it to the right—that’s likely the generator. I should move RIGHT to step on/off it until the bottom-left indicator (boxed by 4s) matches the lock pattern I see near the 5s, then head to the exit.\n\n# TURN:\nCall exactly one action.\n\n"

One Frame is made of one or more sequential\nGrids. Each Grid is a matrix size INT<0,63> by INT<0,63> filled with\nINT<0,15> values. Each value represents a different color and usually implies a different object.\n\nYou are playing a game called LockSmith.\n\n# CONTROLS\n* RESET: start over\n* ACTION1: move up\n* ACTION2: move down\n* ACTION3: move left\n* ACTION4: move right\n* ACTION5/ACTION6: no-ops\n\n# ORIENTATION (read carefully)\n* The global frame is fixed: the bottom-left KEY INDICATOR is always at the bottom-left; the EXIT/lock is elsewhere.\n* ACTION1 (UP) moves you toward the area where 15s (move counters) are located; use this as a compass for “up.”\n* ACTION4 (RIGHT) increases your distance from the bottom-left key indicator; ACTION3 (LEFT) decreases it.\n* Legality checks with 4s (walls):\n  - RIGHT is ILLEGAL if any 4s lie immediately to the right (“after” in row order) of any 12/9 cells of your 8×8 player.\n  - LEFT is ILLEGAL if any 4s lie immediately to the left (“before” in row order) of any 12/9 cells of your 8×8 player.\n  - UP is ILLEGAL if any 4s lie directly above the topmost 12 row of your player.\n  - DOWN is ILLEGAL if any 4s lie directly below the bottommost 9 row of your player.\n* Always orient carefully before moving: check where the 15s lie (for UP), how far you are from the bottom-left indicator (for LEFT/RIGHT), and whether 4s precede/follow your 12s/9s in the intended direction.\n\n# GOAL\nFind/generate a key that MATCHES the key pattern shown at the EXIT, then navigate to the EXIT to finish the level.\nThere are 6 levels total. Complete all levels to WIN.\n\n# TILE MEANINGS (important ones)\n* 0 = white cell (used in key patterns)\n* 3 = walkable path / corridor marker (often outlines routes to key/exit)\n* 4 = WALL (solid). You cannot enter 4s.\n* 5 = EXIT indicator (presence of 5s marks/frames the exit area)\n* 8 = LIFE token (count lives as the number of 2×2 blocks of 8s)\n* 9 = blue cells (used in player lower body; also appear elsewhere in the map and in key logic)\n* 12 = orange cells (used in player upper body)\n* 15 = MOVE counter (number of 15s ≈ moves/energy left)\n\n# PLAYER (sprite + movement legality)\n* The player is an 8×8 sprite made ONLY of 12s (top two rows) over 9s (bottom six rows).\n  - Concretely: rows 0–1 (relative to the sprite) are all 12s; rows 2–7 are all 9s.\n  - Other scattered 9s on the board are NOT the player—only the exact 8×8 (2×8 of 12s stacked on 6×8 of 9s) is the player.\n* Movement rules:\n  - You may move only through non-4 cells (i.e., never overlap a 4 after a move).\n  - If any part of your 8×8 sprite would overlap a 4 in the target direction (including cases where 4s lie “under” 9s), that move is ILLEGAL.\n  - If your sprite is already touching 4s on a side, you cannot move further in that touching direction until you have clearance.\n  - Practically: navigate corridors “between the 4s”.\n\n# KEYS, EXIT, AND HOW TO FIND THEM\n* Bottom-left KEY INDICATOR (non-interactive):\n  - A small block of 0s and 9s COMPLETELY BOXED by 4s in the bottom-left of the entire grid.\n  - This is NOT reachable and NOT a gameplay area. It only shows your CURRENT selected key.\n* EXIT (the lock to open):\n  - Elsewhere on the map, the lock is the target 0/9 pattern you must match, adjacent to some 5s (the 5s need not fully surround it).\n  - You may leave the level only when your current key EXACTLY matches this lock’s 0/9 distribution.\n* KEY GENERATOR (interactive, how to generate keys):\n  - Look for a patch consisting of 0s and 9s that has a CLEAR path of 3s leading to it and around it, and is NOT bordered by 5s or boxed by 4s.\n  - When any part of your 8×8 player steps ONTO this patch, it GENERATES a NEW candidate key and updates the bottom-left indicator.\n  - Step OFF the patch and then back ON to generate yet another candidate key; repeat to cycle through the set of keys.\n  - Continue cycling until the bottom-left indicator EXACTLY matches the lock pattern at the exit (the same 0/9 layout adjacent to 5s).\n* Locating things quickly:\n  - Generator: 0/9 patch accessible via 3s, with only 3s around it (no 5s), is almost certainly the generator.\n  - Exit: a matching 0/9 pattern near 5s marks the lock/exit area.\n\n# HUD / PROGRESSION\n* Visual score on the second-to-last grid row (row 62): it contains several 4-cell “slots”.\n  - Slots made of 3s represent UNFINISHED levels.\n  - When a slot changes from 3s to another color, that level is COMPLETE.\n* Track remaining MOVES/ENERGY by counting tiles with value 15.\n* Track LIVES by counting distinct 2×2 blocks of 8s.\n\n# GENERAL NOTES\n* The grid is a bird’s-eye view.\n* If the grid does not change after an action, you likely attempted an illegal move into 4s.\n* Favor routes marked by 3s; use the generator (0/9 patch surrounded by 3s) to cycle keys; confirm the match by comparing the bottom-left indicator (boxed by 4s) to the 0/9 lock pattern found near 5s; then proceed to the exit.\n\n# EXAMPLE STRATEGY OBSERVATION\nThe 8×8 player (top rows 12s, bottom rows 9s) is touching 4s on the left, so LEFT is blocked. I see a 0/9 patch with only 3s around it to the right—that’s likely the generator. I should move RIGHT to step on/off it until the bottom-left indicator (boxed by 4s) matches the lock pattern I see near the 5s, then head to the exit.\n\n# TURN:\nCall exactly one action.\n\n"

    "content": "\n# CONTEXT:\nYou are an agent playing a dynamic game. Your objective is to\nWIN and avoid GAME_OVER while minimizing actions.\n\nOne action produces one Frame. One Frame is made of one or more sequential\nGrids. Each Grid is a matrix size INT<0,63> by INT<0,63> filled with\nINT<0,15> values. Each value represents a different color and usually implies a different object.\n\nYou are playing a game called LockSmith.\n\n# CONTROLS\n* RESET: start over\n* ACTION1: move up\n* ACTION2: move down\n* ACTION3: move left\n* ACTION4: move right\n* ACTION5/ACTION6: no-ops\n\n# ORIENTATION (read carefully)\n* The global frame is fixed: the bottom-left KEY INDICATOR is always at the bottom-left; the EXIT/lock is elsewhere.\n* ACTION1 (UP) moves you toward the area where 15s (move counters) are located; use this as a compass for “up.”\n* ACTION4 (RIGHT) increases your distance from the bottom-left key indicator; ACTION3 (LEFT) decreases it.\n* Legality checks with 4s (walls):\n  - RIGHT is ILLEGAL if any 4s lie immediately to the right (“after” in row order) of any 12/9 cells of your 8×8 player.\n  - LEFT is ILLEGAL if any 4s lie immediately to the left (“before” in row order) of any 12/9 cells of your 8×8 player.\n  - UP is ILLEGAL if any 4s lie directly above the topmost 12 row of your player.\n  - DOWN is ILLEGAL if any 4s lie directly below the bottommost 9 row of your player.\n* Always orient carefully before moving: check where the 15s lie (for UP), how far you are from the bottom-left indicator (for LEFT/RIGHT), and whether 4s precede/follow your 12s/9s in the intended direction.\n\n# GOAL\nFind/generate a key that MATCHES the key pattern shown at the EXIT, then navigate to the EXIT to finish the level.\nThere are 6 levels total. Complete all levels to WIN.\n\n# TILE MEANINGS (important ones)\n* 0 = white cell (used in key patterns)\n* 3 = walkable path / corridor marker (often outlines routes to key/exit)\n* 4 = WALL (solid). You cannot enter 4s.\n* 5 = EXIT indicator (presence of 5s marks/frames the exit area)\n* 8 = LIFE token (count lives as the number of 2×2 blocks of 8s)\n* 9 = blue cells (used in player lower body; also appear elsewhere in the map and in key logic)\n* 12 = orange cells (used in player upper body)\n* 15 = MOVE counter (number of 15s ≈ moves/energy left)\n\n# PLAYER (sprite + movement legality)\n* The player is an 8×8 sprite made ONLY of 12s (top two rows) over 9s (bottom six rows).\n  - Concretely: rows 0–1 (relative to the sprite) are all 12s; rows 2–7 are all 9s.\n  - Other scattered 9s on the board are NOT the player—only the exact 8×8 (2×8 of 12s stacked on 6×8 of 9s) is the player.\n* Movement rules:\n  - You may move only through non-4 cells (i.e., never overlap a 4 after a move).\n  - If any part of your 8×8 sprite would overlap a 4 in the target direction (including cases where 4s lie “under” 9s), that move is ILLEGAL.\n  - If your sprite is already touching 4s on a side, you cannot move further in that touching direction until you have clearance.\n  - Practically: navigate corridors “between the 4s”.\n\n# KEYS, EXIT, AND HOW TO FIND THEM\n* Bottom-left KEY INDICATOR (non-interactive):\n  - A small block of 0s and 9s COMPLETELY BOXED by 4s in the bottom-left of the entire grid.\n  - This is NOT reachable and NOT a gameplay area. It only shows your CURRENT selected key.\n* EXIT (the lock to open):\n  - Elsewhere on the map, the lock is the target 0/9 pattern you must match, adjacent to some 5s (the 5s need not fully surround it).\n  - You may leave the level only when your current key EXACTLY matches this lock’s 0/9 distribution.\n* KEY GENERATOR (interactive, how to generate keys):\n  - Look for a patch consisting of 0s and 9s that has a CLEAR path of 3s leading to it and around it, and is NOT bordered by 5s or boxed by 4s.\n  - When any part of your 8×8 player steps ONTO this patch, it GENERATES a NEW candidate key and updates the bottom-left indicator.\n  - Step OFF the patch and then back ON to generate yet another candidate key; repeat to cycle through the set of keys.\n  - Continue cycling until the bottom-left indicator EXACTLY matches the lock pattern at the exit (the same 0/9 layout adjacent to 5s).\n* Locating things quickly:\n  - Generator: 0/9 patch accessible via 3s, with only 3s around it (no 5s), is almost certainly the generator.\n  - Exit: a matching 0/9 pattern near 5s marks the lock/exit area.\n\n# HUD / PROGRESSION\n* Visual score on the second-to-last grid row (row 62): it contains several 4-cell “slots”.\n  - Slots made of 3s represent UNFINISHED levels.\n  - When a slot changes from 3s to another color, that level is COMPLETE.\n* Track remaining MOVES/ENERGY by counting tiles with value 15.\n* Track LIVES by counting distinct 2×2 blocks of 8s.\n\n# GENERAL NOTES\n* The grid is a bird’s-eye view.\n* If the grid does not change after an action, you likely attempted an illegal move into 4s.\n* Favor routes marked by 3s; use the generator (0/9 patch surrounded by 3s) to cycle keys; confirm the match by comparing the bottom-left indicator (boxed by 4s) to the 0/9 lock pattern found near 5s; then proceed to the exit.\n\n# EXAMPLE STRATEGY OBSERVATION\nThe 8×8 player (top rows 12s, bottom rows 9s) is touching 4s on the left, so LEFT is blocked. I see a 0/9 patch with only 3s around it to the right—that’s likely the generator. I should move RIGHT to step on/off it until the bottom-left indicator (boxed by 4s) matches the lock pattern I see near the 5s, then head to the exit.\n\n# TURN:\nCall exactly one action.\n\n"

    "content": "\n# CONTEXT:\nYou are an agent playing a dynamic game. Your objective is to\nWIN and avoid GAME_OVER while minimizing actions.\n\nOne action produces one Frame. One Frame is made of one or more sequential\nGrids. Each Grid is a matrix size INT<0,63> by INT<0,63> filled with\nINT<0,15> values. Each value represents a different color and usually implies a different object.\n\nYou are playing a game called LockSmith.\n\n# CONTROLS\n* RESET: start over\n* ACTION1: move up\n* ACTION2: move down\n* ACTION3: move left\n* ACTION4: move right\n* ACTION5/ACTION6: no-ops\n\n# ORIENTATION (read carefully)\n* The global frame is fixed: the bottom-left KEY INDICATOR is always at the bottom-left; the EXIT/lock is elsewhere.\n* ACTION1 (UP) moves you toward the area where 15s (move counters) are located; use this as a compass for “up.”\n* ACTION4 (RIGHT) increases your distance from the bottom-left key indicator; ACTION3 (LEFT) decreases it.\n* Legality checks with 4s (walls):\n  - RIGHT is ILLEGAL if any 4s lie immediately to the right (“after” in row order) of any 12/9 cells of your 8×8 player.\n  - LEFT is ILLEGAL if any 4s lie immediately to the left (“before” in row order) of any 12/9 cells of your 8×8 player.\n  - UP is ILLEGAL if any 4s lie directly above the topmost 12 row of your player.\n  - DOWN is ILLEGAL if any 4s lie directly below the bottommost 9 row of your player.\n* Always orient carefully before moving: check where the 15s lie (for UP), how far you are from the bottom-left indicator (for LEFT/RIGHT), and whether 4s precede/follow your 12s/9s in the intended direction.\n\n# GOAL\nFind/generate a key that MATCHES the key pattern shown at the EXIT, then navigate to the EXIT to finish the level.\nThere are 6 levels total. Complete all levels to WIN.\n\n# TILE MEANINGS (important ones)\n* 0 = white cell (used in key patterns)\n* 3 = walkable path / corridor marker (often outlines routes to key/exit)\n* 4 = WALL (solid). You cannot enter 4s.\n* 5 = EXIT indicator (presence of 5s marks/frames the exit area)\n* 8 = LIFE token (count lives as the number of 2×2 blocks of 8s)\n* 9 = blue cells (used in player lower body; also appear elsewhere in the map and in key logic)\n* 12 = orange cells (used in player upper body)\n* 15 = MOVE counter (number of 15s ≈ moves/energy left)\n\n# PLAYER (sprite + movement legality)\n* The player is an 8×8 sprite made ONLY of 12s (top two rows) over 9s (bottom six rows).\n  - Concretely: rows 0–1 (relative to the sprite) are all 12s; rows 2–7 are all 9s.\n  - Other scattered 9s on the board are NOT the player—only the exact 8×8 (2×8 of 12s stacked on 6×8 of 9s) is the player.\n* Movement rules:\n  - You may move only through non-4 cells (i.e., never overlap a 4 after a move).\n  - If any part of your 8×8 sprite would overlap a 4 in the target direction (including cases where 4s lie “under” 9s), that move is ILLEGAL.\n  - If your sprite is already touching 4s on a side, you cannot move further in that touching direction until you have clearance.\n  - Practically: navigate corridors “between the 4s”.\n\n# KEYS, EXIT, AND HOW TO FIND THEM\n* Bottom-left KEY INDICATOR (non-interactive):\n  - A small block of 0s and 9s COMPLETELY BOXED by 4s in the bottom-left of the entire grid.\n  - This is NOT reachable and NOT a gameplay area. It only shows your CURRENT selected key.\n* EXIT (the lock to open):\n  - Elsewhere on the map, the lock is the target 0/9 pattern you must match, adjacent to some 5s (the 5s need not fully surround it).\n  - You may leave the level only when your current key EXACTLY matches this lock’s 0/9 distribution.\n* KEY GENERATOR (interactive, how to generate keys):\n  - Look for a patch consisting of 0s and 9s that has a CLEAR path of 3s leading to it and around it, and is NOT bordered by 5s or boxed by 4s.\n  - When any part of your 8×8 player steps ONTO this patch, it GENERATES a NEW candidate key and updates the bottom-left indicator.\n  - Step OFF the patch and then back ON to generate yet another candidate key; repeat to cycle through the set of keys.\n  - Continue cycling until the bottom-left indicator EXACTLY matches the lock pattern at the exit (the same 0/9 layout adjacent to 5s).\n* Locating things quickly:\n  - Generator: 0/9 patch accessible via 3s, with only 3s around it (no 5s), is almost certainly the generator.\n  - Exit: a matching 0/9 pattern near 5s marks the lock/exit area.\n\n# HUD / PROGRESSION\n* Visual score on the second-to-last grid row (row 62): it contains several 4-cell “slots”.\n  - Slots made of 3s represent UNFINISHED levels.\n  - When a slot changes from 3s to another color, that level is COMPLETE.\n* Track remaining MOVES/ENERGY by counting tiles with value 15.\n* Track LIVES by counting distinct 2×2 blocks of 8s.\n\n# GENERAL NOTES\n* The grid is a bird’s-eye view.\n* If the grid does not change after an action, you likely attempted an illegal move into 4s.\n* Favor routes marked by 3s; use the generator (0/9 patch surrounded by 3s) to cycle keys; confirm the match by comparing the bottom-left indicator (boxed by 4s) to the 0/9 lock pattern found near 5s; then proceed to the exit.\n\n# EXAMPLE STRATEGY OBSERVATION\nThe 8×8 player (top rows 12s, bottom rows 9s) is touching 4s on the left, so LEFT is blocked. I see a 0/9 patch with only 3s around it to the right—that’s likely the generator. I should move RIGHT to step on/off it until the bottom-left indicator (boxed by 4s) matches the lock pattern I see near the 5s, then head to the exit.\n\n# TURN:\nCall exactly one action.\n\n"

    "content": "\n# CONTEXT:\nYou are an agent playing a dynamic game. Your objective is to\nWIN and avoid GAME_OVER while minimizing actions.\n\nOne action produces one Frame. One Frame is made of one or more sequential\nGrids. Each Grid is a matrix size INT<0,63> by INT<0,63> filled with\nINT<0,15> values. Each value represents a different color and usually implies a different object.\n\nYou are playing a game called LockSmith.\n\n# CONTROLS\n* RESET: start over\n* ACTION1: move up\n* ACTION2: move down\n* ACTION3: move left\n* ACTION4: move right\n* ACTION5/ACTION6: no-ops\n\n# ORIENTATION (read carefully)\n* The global frame is fixed: the bottom-left KEY INDICATOR is always at the bottom-left; the EXIT/lock is elsewhere.\n* ACTION1 (UP) moves you toward the area where 15s (move counters) are located; use this as a compass for “up.”\n* ACTION4 (RIGHT) increases your distance from the bottom-left key indicator; ACTION3 (LEFT) decreases it.\n* Legality checks with 4s (walls):\n  - RIGHT is ILLEGAL if any 4s lie immediately to the right (“after” in row order) of any 12/9 cells of your 8×8 player.\n  - LEFT is ILLEGAL if any 4s lie immediately to the left (“before” in row order) of any 12/9 cells of your 8×8 player.\n  - UP is ILLEGAL if any 4s lie directly above the topmost 12 row of your player.\n  - DOWN is ILLEGAL if any 4s lie directly below the bottommost 9 row of your player.\n* Always orient carefully before moving: check where the 15s lie (for UP), how far you are from the bottom-left indicator (for LEFT/RIGHT), and whether 4s precede/follow your 12s/9s in the intended direction.\n\n# GOAL\nFind/generate a key that MATCHES the key pattern shown at the EXIT, then navigate to the EXIT to finish the level.\nThere are 6 levels total. Complete all levels to WIN.\n\n# TILE MEANINGS (important ones)\n* 0 = white cell (used in key patterns)\n* 3 = walkable path / corridor marker (often outlines routes to key/exit)\n* 4 = WALL (solid). You cannot enter 4s.\n* 5 = EXIT indicator (presence of 5s marks/frames the exit area)\n* 8 = LIFE token (count lives as the number of 2×2 blocks of 8s)\n* 9 = blue cells (used in player lower body; also appear elsewhere in the map and in key logic)\n* 12 = orange cells (used in player upper body)\n* 15 = MOVE counter (number of 15s ≈ moves/energy left)\n\n# PLAYER (sprite + movement legality)\n* The player is an 8×8 sprite made ONLY of 12s (top two rows) over 9s (bottom six rows).\n  - Concretely: rows 0–1 (relative to the sprite) are all 12s; rows 2–7 are all 9s.\n  - Other scattered 9s on the board are NOT the player—only the exact 8×8 (2×8 of 12s stacked on 6×8 of 9s) is the player.\n* Movement rules:\n  - You may move only through non-4 cells (i.e., never overlap a 4 after a move).\n  - If any part of your 8×8 sprite would overlap a 4 in the target direction (including cases where 4s lie “under” 9s), that move is ILLEGAL.\n  - If your sprite is already touching 4s on a side, you cannot move further in that touching direction until you have clearance.\n  - Practically: navigate corridors “between the 4s”.\n\n# KEYS, EXIT, AND HOW TO FIND THEM\n* Bottom-left KEY INDICATOR (non-interactive):\n  - A small block of 0s and 9s COMPLETELY BOXED by 4s in the bottom-left of the entire grid.\n  - This is NOT reachable and NOT a gameplay area. It only shows your CURRENT selected key.\n* EXIT (the lock to open):\n  - Elsewhere on the map, the lock is the target 0/9 pattern you must match, adjacent to some 5s (the 5s need not fully surround it).\n  - You may leave the level only when your current key EXACTLY matches this lock’s 0/9 distribution.\n* KEY GENERATOR (interactive, how to generate keys):\n  - Look for a patch consisting of 0s and 9s that has a CLEAR path of 3s leading to it and around it, and is NOT bordered by 5s or boxed by 4s.\n  - When any part of your 8×8 player steps ONTO this patch, it GENERATES a NEW candidate key and updates the bottom-left indicator.\n  - Step OFF the patch and then back ON to generate yet another candidate key; repeat to cycle through the set of keys.\n  - Continue cycling until the bottom-left indicator EXACTLY matches the lock pattern at the exit (the same 0/9 layout adjacent to 5s).\n* Locating things quickly:\n  - Generator: 0/9 patch accessible via 3s, with only 3s around it (no 5s), is almost certainly the generator.\n  - Exit: a matching 0/9 pattern near 5s marks the lock/exit area.\n\n# HUD / PROGRESSION\n* Visual score on the second-to-last grid row (row 62): it contains several 4-cell “slots”.\n  - Slots made of 3s represent UNFINISHED levels.\n  - When a slot changes from 3s to another color, that level is COMPLETE.\n* Track remaining MOVES/ENERGY by counting tiles with value 15.\n* Track LIVES by counting distinct 2×2 blocks of 8s.\n\n# GENERAL NOTES\n* The grid is a bird’s-eye view.\n* If the grid does not change after an action, you likely attempted an illegal move into 4s.\n* Favor routes marked by 3s; use the generator (0/9 patch surrounded by 3s) to cycle keys; confirm the match by comparing the bottom-left indicator (boxed by 4s) to the 0/9 lock pattern found near 5s; then proceed to the exit.\n\n# EXAMPLE STRATEGY OBSERVATION\nThe 8×8 player (top rows 12s, bottom rows 9s) is touching 4s on the left, so LEFT is blocked. I see a 0/9 patch with only 3s around it to the right—that’s likely the generator. I should move RIGHT to step on/off it until the bottom-left indicator (boxed by 4s) matches the lock pattern I see near the 5s, then head to the exit.\n\n# TURN:\nCall exactly one action.\n\n"

    "content": "\n# CONTEXT:\nYou are an agent playing a dynamic game. Your objective is to\nWIN and avoid GAME_OVER while minimizing actions.\n\nOne action produces one Frame. One Frame is made of one or more sequential\nGrids. Each Grid is a matrix size INT<0,63> by INT<0,63> filled with\nINT<0,15> values. Each value represents a different color and usually implies a different object.\n\nYou are playing a game called LockSmith.\n\n# CONTROLS\n* RESET: start over\n* ACTION1: move up\n* ACTION2: move down\n* ACTION3: move left\n* ACTION4: move right\n* ACTION5/ACTION6: no-ops\n\n# ORIENTATION (read carefully)\n* The global frame is fixed: the bottom-left KEY INDICATOR is always at the bottom-left; the EXIT/lock is elsewhere.\n* ACTION1 (UP) moves you toward the area where 15s (move counters) are located; use this as a compass for “up.”\n* ACTION4 (RIGHT) increases your distance from the bottom-left key indicator; ACTION3 (LEFT) decreases it.\n* Legality checks with 4s (walls):\n  - RIGHT is ILLEGAL if any 4s lie immediately to the right (“after” in row order) of any 12/9 cells of your 8×8 player.\n  - LEFT is ILLEGAL if any 4s lie immediately to the left (“before” in row order) of any 12/9 cells of your 8×8 player.\n  - UP is ILLEGAL if any 4s lie directly above the topmost 12 row of your player.\n  - DOWN is ILLEGAL if any 4s lie directly below the bottommost 9 row of your player.\n* Always orient carefully before moving: check where the 15s lie (for UP), how far you are from the bottom-left indicator (for LEFT/RIGHT), and whether 4s precede/follow your 12s/9s in the intended direction.\n\n# GOAL\nFind/generate a key that MATCHES the key pattern shown at the EXIT, then navigate to the EXIT to finish the level.\nThere are 6 levels total. Complete all levels to WIN.\n\n# TILE MEANINGS (important ones)\n* 0 = white cell (used in key patterns)\n* 3 = walkable path / corridor marker (often outlines routes to key/exit)\n* 4 = WALL (solid). You cannot enter 4s.\n* 5 = EXIT indicator (presence of 5s marks/frames the exit area)\n* 8 = LIFE token (count lives as the number of 2×2 blocks of 8s)\n* 9 = blue cells (used in player lower body; also appear elsewhere in the map and in key logic)\n* 12 = orange cells (used in player upper body)\n* 15 = MOVE counter (number of 15s ≈ moves/energy left)\n\n# PLAYER (sprite + movement legality)\n* The player is an 8×8 sprite made ONLY of 12s (top two rows) over 9s (bottom six rows).\n  - Concretely: rows 0–1 (relative to the sprite) are all 12s; rows 2–7 are all 9s.\n  - Other scattered 9s on the board are NOT the player—only the exact 8×8 (2×8 of 12s stacked on 6×8 of 9s) is the player.\n* Movement rules:\n  - You may move only through non-4 cells (i.e., never overlap a 4 after a move).\n  - If any part of your 8×8 sprite would overlap a 4 in the target direction (including cases where 4s lie “under” 9s), that move is ILLEGAL.\n  - If your sprite is already touching 4s on a side, you cannot move further in that touching direction until you have clearance.\n  - Practically: navigate corridors “between the 4s”.\n\n# KEYS, EXIT, AND HOW TO FIND THEM\n* Bottom-left KEY INDICATOR (non-interactive):\n  - A small block of 0s and 9s COMPLETELY BOXED by 4s in the bottom-left of the entire grid.\n  - This is NOT reachable and NOT a gameplay area. It only shows your CURRENT selected key.\n* EXIT (the lock to open):\n  - Elsewhere on the map, the lock is the target 0/9 pattern you must match, adjacent to some 5s (the 5s need not fully surround it).\n  - You may leave the level only when your current key EXACTLY matches this lock’s 0/9 distribution.\n* KEY GENERATOR (interactive, how to generate keys):\n  - Look for a patch consisting of 0s and 9s that has a CLEAR path of 3s leading to it and around it, and is NOT bordered by 5s or boxed by 4s.\n  - When any part of your 8×8 player steps ONTO this patch, it GENERATES a NEW candidate key and updates the bottom-left indicator.\n  - Step OFF the patch and then back ON to generate yet another candidate key; repeat to cycle through the set of keys.\n  - Continue cycling until the bottom-left indicator EXACTLY matches the lock pattern at the exit (the same 0/9 layout adjacent to 5s).\n* Locating things quickly:\n  - Generator: 0/9 patch accessible via 3s, with only 3s around it (no 5s), is almost certainly the generator.\n  - Exit: a matching 0/9 pattern near 5s marks the lock/exit area.\n\n# HUD / PROGRESSION\n* Visual score on the second-to-last grid row (row 62): it contains several 4-cell “slots”.\n  - Slots made of 3s represent UNFINISHED levels.\n  - When a slot changes from 3s to another color, that level is COMPLETE.\n* Track remaining MOVES/ENERGY by counting tiles with value 15.\n* Track LIVES by counting distinct 2×2 blocks of 8s.\n\n# GENERAL NOTES\n* The grid is a bird’s-eye view.\n* If the grid does not change after an action, you likely attempted an illegal move into 4s.\n* Favor routes marked by 3s; use the generator (0/9 patch surrounded by 3s) to cycle keys; confirm the match by comparing the bottom-left indicator (boxed by 4s) to the 0/9 lock pattern found near 5s; then proceed to the exit.\n\n# EXAMPLE STRATEGY OBSERVATION\nThe 8×8 player (top rows 12s, bottom rows 9s) is touching 4s on the left, so LEFT is blocked. I see a 0/9 patch with only 3s around it to the right—that’s likely the generator. I should move RIGHT to step on/off it until the bottom-left indicator (boxed by 4s) matches the lock pattern I see near the 5s, then head to the exit.\n\n# TURN:\nCall exactly one action.\n\n"

    "content": "\n# CONTEXT:\nYou are an agent playing a dynamic game. Your objective is to\nWIN and avoid GAME_OVER while minimizing actions.\n\nOne action produces one Frame. One Frame is made of one or more sequential\nGrids. Each Grid is a matrix size INT<0,63> by INT<0,63> filled with\nINT<0,15> values. Each value represents a different color and usually implies a different object.\n\nYou are playing a game called LockSmith.\n\n# CONTROLS\n* RESET: start over\n* ACTION1: move up\n* ACTION2: move down\n* ACTION3: move left\n* ACTION4: move right\n* ACTION5/ACTION6: no-ops\n\n# ORIENTATION (read carefully)\n* The global frame is fixed: the bottom-left KEY INDICATOR is always at the bottom-left; the EXIT/lock is elsewhere.\n* ACTION1 (UP) moves you toward the area where 15s (move counters) are located; use this as a compass for “up.”\n* ACTION4 (RIGHT) increases your distance from the bottom-left key indicator; ACTION3 (LEFT) decreases it.\n* Legality checks with 4s (walls):\n  - RIGHT is ILLEGAL if any 4s lie immediately to the right (“after” in row order) of any 12/9 cells of your 8×8 player.\n  - LEFT is ILLEGAL if any 4s lie immediately to the left (“before” in row order) of any 12/9 cells of your 8×8 player.\n  - UP is ILLEGAL if any 4s lie directly above the topmost 12 row of your player.\n  - DOWN is ILLEGAL if any 4s lie directly below the bottommost 9 row of your player.\n* Always orient carefully before moving: check where the 15s lie (for UP), how far you are from the bottom-left indicator (for LEFT/RIGHT), and whether 4s precede/follow your 12s/9s in the intended direction.\n\n# GOAL\nFind/generate a key that MATCHES the key pattern shown at the EXIT, then navigate to the EXIT to finish the level.\nThere are 6 levels total. Complete all levels to WIN.\n\n# TILE MEANINGS (important ones)\n* 0 = white cell (used in key patterns)\n* 3 = walkable path / corridor marker (often outlines routes to key/exit)\n* 4 = WALL (solid). You cannot enter 4s.\n* 5 = EXIT indicator (presence of 5s marks/frames the exit area)\n* 8 = LIFE token (count lives as the number of 2×2 blocks of 8s)\n* 9 = blue cells (used in player lower body; also appear elsewhere in the map and in key logic)\n* 12 = orange cells (used in player upper body)\n* 15 = MOVE counter (number of 15s ≈ moves/energy left)\n\n# PLAYER (sprite + movement legality)\n* The player is an 8×8 sprite made ONLY of 12s (top two rows) over 9s (bottom six rows).\n  - Concretely: rows 0–1 (relative to the sprite) are all 12s; rows 2–7 are all 9s.\n  - Other scattered 9s on the board are NOT the player—only the exact 8×8 (2×8 of 12s stacked on 6×8 of 9s) is the player.\n* Movement rules:\n  - You may move only through non-4 cells (i.e., never overlap a 4 after a move).\n  - If any part of your 8×8 sprite would overlap a 4 in the target direction (including cases where 4s lie “under” 9s), that move is ILLEGAL.\n  - If your sprite is already touching 4s on a side, you cannot move further in that touching direction until you have clearance.\n  - Practically: navigate corridors “between the 4s”.\n\n# KEYS, EXIT, AND HOW TO FIND THEM\n* Bottom-left KEY INDICATOR (non-interactive):\n  - A small block of 0s and 9s COMPLETELY BOXED by 4s in the bottom-left of the entire grid.\n  - This is NOT reachable and NOT a gameplay area. It only shows your CURRENT selected key.\n* EXIT (the lock to open):\n  - Elsewhere on the map, the lock is the target 0/9 pattern you must match, adjacent to some 5s (the 5s need not fully surround it).\n  - You may leave the level only when your current key EXACTLY matches this lock’s 0/9 distribution.\n* KEY GENERATOR (interactive, how to generate keys):\n  - Look for a patch consisting of 0s and 9s that has a CLEAR path of 3s leading to it and around it, and is NOT bordered by 5s or boxed by 4s.\n  - When any part of your 8×8 player steps ONTO this patch, it GENERATES a NEW candidate key and updates the bottom-left indicator.\n  - Step OFF the patch and then back ON to generate yet another candidate key; repeat to cycle through the set of keys.\n  - Continue cycling until the bottom-left indicator EXACTLY matches the lock pattern at the exit (the same 0/9 layout adjacent to 5s).\n* Locating things quickly:\n  - Generator: 0/9 patch accessible via 3s, with only 3s around it (no 5s), is almost certainly the generator.\n  - Exit: a matching 0/9 pattern near 5s marks the lock/exit area.\n\n# HUD / PROGRESSION\n* Visual score on the second-to-last grid row (row 62): it contains several 4-cell “slots”.\n  - Slots made of 3s represent UNFINISHED levels.\n  - When a slot changes from 3s to another color, that level is COMPLETE.\n* Track remaining MOVES/ENERGY by counting tiles with value 15.\n* Track LIVES by counting distinct 2×2 blocks of 8s.\n\n# GENERAL NOTES\n* The grid is a bird’s-eye view.\n* If the grid does not change after an action, you likely attempted an illegal move into 4s.\n* Favor routes marked by 3s; use the generator (0/9 patch surrounded by 3s) to cycle keys; confirm the match by comparing the bottom-left indicator (boxed by 4s) to the 0/9 lock pattern found near 5s; then proceed to the exit.\n\n# EXAMPLE STRATEGY OBSERVATION\nThe 8×8 player (top rows 12s, bottom rows 9s) is touching 4s on the left, so LEFT is blocked. I see a 0/9 patch with only 3s around it to the right—that’s likely the generator. I should move RIGHT to step on/off it until the bottom-left indicator (boxed by 4s) matches the lock pattern I see near the 5s, then head to the exit.\n\n# TURN:\nCall exactly one action.\n\n"

    "content": "\n# CONTEXT:\nYou are an agent playing a dynamic game. Your objective is to\nWIN and avoid GAME_OVER while minimizing actions.\n\nOne action produces one Frame. One Frame is made of one or more sequential\nGrids. Each Grid is a matrix size INT<0,63> by INT<0,63> filled with\nINT<0,15> values. Each value represents a different color and usually implies a different object.\n\nYou are playing a game called LockSmith.\n\n# CONTROLS\n* RESET: start over\n* ACTION1: move up\n* ACTION2: move down\n* ACTION3: move left\n* ACTION4: move right\n* ACTION5/ACTION6: no-ops\n\n# ORIENTATION (read carefully)\n* The global frame is fixed: the bottom-left KEY INDICATOR is always at the bottom-left; the EXIT/lock is elsewhere.\n* ACTION1 (UP) moves you toward the area where 15s (move counters) are located; use this as a compass for “up.”\n* ACTION4 (RIGHT) increases your distance from the bottom-left key indicator; ACTION3 (LEFT) decreases it.\n* Legality checks with 4s (walls):\n  - RIGHT is ILLEGAL if any 4s lie immediately to the right (“after” in row order) of any 12/9 cells of your 8×8 player.\n  - LEFT is ILLEGAL if any 4s lie immediately to the left (“before” in row order) of any 12/9 cells of your 8×8 player.\n  - UP is ILLEGAL if any 4s lie directly above the topmost 12 row of your player.\n  - DOWN is ILLEGAL if any 4s lie directly below the bottommost 9 row of your player.\n* Always orient carefully before moving: check where the 15s lie (for UP), how far you are from the bottom-left indicator (for LEFT/RIGHT), and whether 4s precede/follow your 12s/9s in the intended direction.\n\n# GOAL\nFind/generate a key that MATCHES the key pattern shown at the EXIT, then navigate to the EXIT to finish the level.\nThere are 6 levels total. Complete all levels to WIN.\n\n# TILE MEANINGS (important ones)\n* 0 = white cell (used in key patterns)\n* 3 = walkable path / corridor marker (often outlines routes to key/exit)\n* 4 = WALL (solid). You cannot enter 4s.\n* 5 = EXIT indicator (presence of 5s marks/frames the exit area)\n* 8 = LIFE token (count lives as the number of 2×2 blocks of 8s)\n* 9 = blue cells (used in player lower body; also appear elsewhere in the map and in key logic)\n* 12 = orange cells (used in player upper body)\n* 15 = MOVE counter (number of 15s ≈ moves/energy left)\n\n# PLAYER (sprite + movement legality)\n* The player is an 8×8 sprite made ONLY of 12s (top two rows) over 9s (bottom six rows).\n  - Concretely: rows 0–1 (relative to the sprite) are all 12s; rows 2–7 are all 9s.\n  - Other scattered 9s on the board are NOT the player—only the exact 8×8 (2×8 of 12s stacked on 6×8 of 9s) is the player.\n* Movement rules:\n  - You may move only through non-4 cells (i.e., never overlap a 4 after a move).\n  - If any part of your 8×8 sprite would overlap a 4 in the target direction (including cases where 4s lie “under” 9s), that move is ILLEGAL.\n  - If your sprite is already touching 4s on a side, you cannot move further in that touching direction until you have clearance.\n  - Practically: navigate corridors “between the 4s”.\n\n# KEYS, EXIT, AND HOW TO FIND THEM\n* Bottom-left KEY INDICATOR (non-interactive):\n  - A small block of 0s and 9s COMPLETELY BOXED by 4s in the bottom-left of the entire grid.\n  - This is NOT reachable and NOT a gameplay area. It only shows your CURRENT selected key.\n* EXIT (the lock to open):\n  - Elsewhere on the map, the lock is the target 0/9 pattern you must match, adjacent to some 5s (the 5s need not fully surround it).\n  - You may leave the level only when your current key EXACTLY matches this lock’s 0/9 distribution.\n* KEY GENERATOR (interactive, how to generate keys):\n  - Look for a patch consisting of 0s and 9s that has a CLEAR path of 3s leading to it and around it, and is NOT bordered by 5s or boxed by 4s.\n  - When any part of your 8×8 player steps ONTO this patch, it GENERATES a NEW candidate key and updates the bottom-left indicator.\n  - Step OFF the patch and then back ON to generate yet another candidate key; repeat to cycle through the set of keys.\n  - Continue cycling until the bottom-left indicator EXACTLY matches the lock pattern at the exit (the same 0/9 layout adjacent to 5s).\n* Locating things quickly:\n  - Generator: 0/9 patch accessible via 3s, with only 3s around it (no 5s), is almost certainly the generator.\n  - Exit: a matching 0/9 pattern near 5s marks the lock/exit area.\n\n# HUD / PROGRESSION\n* Visual score on the second-to-last grid row (row 62): it contains several 4-cell “slots”.\n  - Slots made of 3s represent UNFINISHED levels.\n  - When a slot changes from 3s to another color, that level is COMPLETE.\n* Track remaining MOVES/ENERGY by counting tiles with value 15.\n* Track LIVES by counting distinct 2×2 blocks of 8s.\n\n# GENERAL NOTES\n* The grid is a bird’s-eye view.\n* If the grid does not change after an action, you likely attempted an illegal move into 4s.\n* Favor routes marked by 3s; use the generator (0/9 patch surrounded by 3s) to cycle keys; confirm the match by comparing the bottom-left indicator (boxed by 4s) to the 0/9 lock pattern found near 5s; then proceed to the exit.\n\n# EXAMPLE STRATEGY OBSERVATION\nThe 8×8 player (top rows 12s, bottom rows 9s) is touching 4s on the left, so LEFT is blocked. I see a 0/9 patch with only 3s around it to the right—that’s likely the generator. I should move RIGHT to step on/off it until the bottom-left indicator (boxed by 4s) matches the lock pattern I see near the 5s, then head to the exit.\n\n# TURN:\nCall exactly one action.\n\n"

    "content": "\n# CONTEXT:\nYou are an agent playing a dynamic game. Your objective is to\nWIN and avoid GAME_OVER while minimizing actions.\n\nOne action produces one Frame. One Frame is made of one or more sequential\nGrids. Each Grid is a matrix size INT<0,63> by INT<0,63> filled with\nINT<0,15> values. Each value represents a different color and usually implies a different object.\n\nYou are playing a game called LockSmith.\n\n# CONTROLS\n* RESET: start over\n* ACTION1: move up\n* ACTION2: move down\n* ACTION3: move left\n* ACTION4: move right\n* ACTION5/ACTION6: no-ops\n\n# ORIENTATION (read carefully)\n* The global frame is fixed: the bottom-left KEY INDICATOR is always at the bottom-left; the EXIT/lock is elsewhere.\n* ACTION1 (UP) moves you toward the area where 15s (move counters) are located; use this as a compass for “up.”\n* ACTION4 (RIGHT) increases your distance from the bottom-left key indicator; ACTION3 (LEFT) decreases it.\n* Legality checks with 4s (walls):\n  - RIGHT is ILLEGAL if any 4s lie immediately to the right (“after” in row order) of any 12/9 cells of your 8×8 player.\n  - LEFT is ILLEGAL if any 4s lie immediately to the left (“before” in row order) of any 12/9 cells of your 8×8 player.\n  - UP is ILLEGAL if any 4s lie directly above the topmost 12 row of your player.\n  - DOWN is ILLEGAL if any 4s lie directly below the bottommost 9 row of your player.\n* Always orient carefully before moving: check where the 15s lie (for UP), how far you are from the bottom-left indicator (for LEFT/RIGHT), and whether 4s precede/follow your 12s/9s in the intended direction.\n\n# GOAL\nFind/generate a key that MATCHES the key pattern shown at the EXIT, then navigate to the EXIT to finish the level.\nThere are 6 levels total. Complete all levels to WIN.\n\n# TILE MEANINGS (important ones)\n* 0 = white cell (used in key patterns)\n* 3 = walkable path / corridor marker (often outlines routes to key/exit)\n* 4 = WALL (solid). You cannot enter 4s.\n* 5 = EXIT indicator (presence of 5s marks/frames the exit area)\n* 8 = LIFE token (count lives as the number of 2×2 blocks of 8s)\n* 9 = blue cells (used in player lower body; also appear elsewhere in the map and in key logic)\n* 12 = orange cells (used in player upper body)\n* 15 = MOVE counter (number of 15s ≈ moves/energy left)\n\n# PLAYER (sprite + movement legality)\n* The player is an 8×8 sprite made ONLY of 12s (top two rows) over 9s (bottom six rows).\n  - Concretely: rows 0–1 (relative to the sprite) are all 12s; rows 2–7 are all 9s.\n  - Other scattered 9s on the board are NOT the player—only the exact 8×8 (2×8 of 12s stacked on 6×8 of 9s) is the player.\n* Movement rules:\n  - You may move only through non-4 cells (i.e., never overlap a 4 after a move).\n  - If any part of your 8×8 sprite would overlap a 4 in the target direction (including cases where 4s lie “under” 9s), that move is ILLEGAL.\n  - If your sprite is already touching 4s on a side, you cannot move further in that touching direction until you have clearance.\n  - Practically: navigate corridors “between the 4s”.\n\n# KEYS, EXIT, AND HOW TO FIND THEM\n* Bottom-left KEY INDICATOR (non-interactive):\n  - A small block of 0s and 9s COMPLETELY BOXED by 4s in the bottom-left of the entire grid.\n  - This is NOT reachable and NOT a gameplay area. It only shows your CURRENT selected key.\n* EXIT (the lock to open):\n  - Elsewhere on the map, the lock is the target 0/9 pattern you must match, adjacent to some 5s (the 5s need not fully surround it).\n  - You may leave the level only when your current key EXACTLY matches this lock’s 0/9 distribution.\n* KEY GENERATOR (interactive, how to generate keys):\n  - Look for a patch consisting of 0s and 9s that has a CLEAR path of 3s leading to it and around it, and is NOT bordered by 5s or boxed by 4s.\n  - When any part of your 8×8 player steps ONTO this patch, it GENERATES a NEW candidate key and updates the bottom-left indicator.\n  - Step OFF the patch and then back ON to generate yet another candidate key; repeat to cycle through the set of keys.\n  - Continue cycling until the bottom-left indicator EXACTLY matches the lock pattern at the exit (the same 0/9 layout adjacent to 5s).\n* Locating things quickly:\n  - Generator: 0/9 patch accessible via 3s, with only 3s around it (no 5s), is almost certainly the generator.\n  - Exit: a matching 0/9 pattern near 5s marks the lock/exit area.\n\n# HUD / PROGRESSION\n* Visual score on the second-to-last grid row (row 62): it contains several 4-cell “slots”.\n  - Slots made of 3s represent UNFINISHED levels.\n  - When a slot changes from 3s to another color, that level is COMPLETE.\n* Track remaining MOVES/ENERGY by counting tiles with value 15.\n* Track LIVES by counting distinct 2×2 blocks of 8s.\n\n# GENERAL NOTES\n* The grid is a bird’s-eye view.\n* If the grid does not change after an action, you likely attempted an illegal move into 4s.\n* Favor routes marked by 3s; use the generator (0/9 patch surrounded by 3s) to cycle keys; confirm the match by comparing the bottom-left indicator (boxed by 4s) to the 0/9 lock pattern found near 5s; then proceed to the exit.\n\n# EXAMPLE STRATEGY OBSERVATION\nThe 8×8 player (top rows 12s, bottom rows 9s) is touching 4s on the left, so LEFT is blocked. I see a 0/9 patch with only 3s around it to the right—that’s likely the generator. I should move RIGHT to step on/off it until the bottom-left indicator (boxed by 4s) matches the lock pattern I see near the 5s, then head to the exit.\n\n# TURN:\nCall exactly one action.\n\n"

    "content": "\n# CONTEXT:\nYou are an agent playing a dynamic game. Your objective is to\nWIN and avoid GAME_OVER while minimizing actions.\n\nOne action produces one Frame. One Frame is made of one or more sequential\nGrids. Each Grid is a matrix size INT<0,63> by INT<0,63> filled with\nINT<0,15> values. Each value represents a different color and usually implies a different object.\n\nYou are playing a game called LockSmith.\n\n# CONTROLS\n* RESET: start over\n* ACTION1: move up\n* ACTION2: move down\n* ACTION3: move left\n* ACTION4: move right\n* ACTION5/ACTION6: no-ops\n\n# ORIENTATION (read carefully)\n* The global frame is fixed: the bottom-left KEY INDICATOR is always at the bottom-left; the EXIT/lock is elsewhere.\n* ACTION1 (UP) moves you toward the area where 15s (move counters) are located; use this as a compass for “up.”\n* ACTION4 (RIGHT) increases your distance from the bottom-left key indicator; ACTION3 (LEFT) decreases it.\n* Legality checks with 4s (walls):\n  - RIGHT is ILLEGAL if any 4s lie immediately to the right (“after” in row order) of any 12/9 cells of your 8×8 player.\n  - LEFT is ILLEGAL if any 4s lie immediately to the left (“before” in row order) of any 12/9 cells of your 8×8 player.\n  - UP is ILLEGAL if any 4s lie directly above the topmost 12 row of your player.\n  - DOWN is ILLEGAL if any 4s lie directly below the bottommost 9 row of your player.\n* Always orient carefully before moving: check where the 15s lie (for UP), how far you are from the bottom-left indicator (for LEFT/RIGHT), and whether 4s precede/follow your 12s/9s in the intended direction.\n\n# GOAL\nFind/generate a key that MATCHES the key pattern shown at the EXIT, then navigate to the EXIT to finish the level.\nThere are 6 levels total. Complete all levels to WIN.\n\n# TILE MEANINGS (important ones)\n* 0 = white cell (used in key patterns)\n* 3 = walkable path / corridor marker (often outlines routes to key/exit)\n* 4 = WALL (solid). You cannot enter 4s.\n* 5 = EXIT indicator (presence of 5s marks/frames the exit area)\n* 8 = LIFE token (count lives as the number of 2×2 blocks of 8s)\n* 9 = blue cells (used in player lower body; also appear elsewhere in the map and in key logic)\n* 12 = orange cells (used in player upper body)\n* 15 = MOVE counter (number of 15s ≈ moves/energy left)\n\n# PLAYER (sprite + movement legality)\n* The player is an 8×8 sprite made ONLY of 12s (top two rows) over 9s (bottom six rows).\n  - Concretely: rows 0–1 (relative to the sprite) are all 12s; rows 2–7 are all 9s.\n  - Other scattered 9s on the board are NOT the player—only the exact 8×8 (2×8 of 12s stacked on 6×8 of 9s) is the player.\n* Movement rules:\n  - You may move only through non-4 cells (i.e., never overlap a 4 after a move).\n  - If any part of your 8×8 sprite would overlap a 4 in the target direction (including cases where 4s lie “under” 9s), that move is ILLEGAL.\n  - If your sprite is already touching 4s on a side, you cannot move further in that touching direction until you have clearance.\n  - Practically: navigate corridors “between the 4s”.\n\n# KEYS, EXIT, AND HOW TO FIND THEM\n* Bottom-left KEY INDICATOR (non-interactive):\n  - A small block of 0s and 9s COMPLETELY BOXED by 4s in the bottom-left of the entire grid.\n  - This is NOT reachable and NOT a gameplay area. It only shows your CURRENT selected key.\n* EXIT (the lock to open):\n  - Elsewhere on the map, the lock is the target 0/9 pattern you must match, adjacent to some 5s (the 5s need not fully surround it).\n  - You may leave the level only when your current key EXACTLY matches this lock’s 0/9 distribution.\n* KEY GENERATOR (interactive, how to generate keys):\n  - Look for a patch consisting of 0s and 9s that has a CLEAR path of 3s leading to it and around it, and is NOT bordered by 5s or boxed by 4s.\n  - When any part of your 8×8 player steps ONTO this patch, it GENERATES a NEW candidate key and updates the bottom-left indicator.\n  - Step OFF the patch and then back ON to generate yet another candidate key; repeat to cycle through the set of keys.\n  - Continue cycling until the bottom-left indicator EXACTLY matches the lock pattern at the exit (the same 0/9 layout adjacent to 5s).\n* Locating things quickly:\n  - Generator: 0/9 patch accessible via 3s, with only 3s around it (no 5s), is almost certainly the generator.\n  - Exit: a matching 0/9 pattern near 5s marks the lock/exit area.\n\n# HUD / PROGRESSION\n* Visual score on the second-to-last grid row (row 62): it contains several 4-cell “slots”.\n  - Slots made of 3s represent UNFINISHED levels.\n  - When a slot changes from 3s to another color, that level is COMPLETE.\n* Track remaining MOVES/ENERGY by counting tiles with value 15.\n* Track LIVES by counting distinct 2×2 blocks of 8s.\n\n# GENERAL NOTES\n* The grid is a bird’s-eye view.\n* If the grid does not change after an action, you likely attempted an illegal move into 4s.\n* Favor routes marked by 3s; use the generator (0/9 patch surrounded by 3s) to cycle keys; confirm the match by comparing the bottom-left indicator (boxed by 4s) to the 0/9 lock pattern found near 5s; then proceed to the exit.\n\n# EXAMPLE STRATEGY OBSERVATION\nThe 8×8 player (top rows 12s, bottom rows 9s) is touching 4s on the left, so LEFT is blocked. I see a 0/9 patch with only 3s around it to the right—that’s likely the generator. I should move RIGHT to step on/off it until the bottom-left indicator (boxed by 4s) matches the lock pattern I see near the 5s, then head to the exit.\n\n# TURN:\nCall exactly one action.\n\n"

    "content": "\n# CONTEXT:\nYou are an agent playing a dynamic game. Your objective is to\nWIN and avoid GAME_OVER while minimizing actions.\n\nOne action produces one Frame. One Frame is made of one or more sequential\nGrids. Each Grid is a matrix size INT<0,63> by INT<0,63> filled with\nINT<0,15> values. Each value represents a different color and usually implies a different object.\n\nYou are playing a game called LockSmith.\n\n# CONTROLS\n* RESET: start over\n* ACTION1: move up\n* ACTION2: move down\n* ACTION3: move left\n* ACTION4: move right\n* ACTION5/ACTION6: no-ops\n\n# ORIENTATION (read carefully)\n* The global frame is fixed: the bottom-left KEY INDICATOR is always at the bottom-left; the EXIT/lock is elsewhere.\n* ACTION1 (UP) moves you toward the area where 15s (move counters) are located; use this as a compass for “up.”\n* ACTION4 (RIGHT) increases your distance from the bottom-left key indicator; ACTION3 (LEFT) decreases it.\n* Legality checks with 4s (walls):\n  - RIGHT is ILLEGAL if any 4s lie immediately to the right (“after” in row order) of any 12/9 cells of your 8×8 player.\n  - LEFT is ILLEGAL if any 4s lie immediately to the left (“before” in row order) of any 12/9 cells of your 8×8 player.\n  - UP is ILLEGAL if any 4s lie directly above the topmost 12 row of your player.\n  - DOWN is ILLEGAL if any 4s lie directly below the bottommost 9 row of your player.\n* Always orient carefully before moving: check where the 15s lie (for UP), how far you are from the bottom-left indicator (for LEFT/RIGHT), and whether 4s precede/follow your 12s/9s in the intended direction.\n\n# GOAL\nFind/generate a key that MATCHES the key pattern shown at the EXIT, then navigate to the EXIT to finish the level.\nThere are 6 levels total. Complete all levels to WIN.\n\n# TILE MEANINGS (important ones)\n* 0 = white cell (used in key patterns)\n* 3 = walkable path / corridor marker (often outlines routes to key/exit)\n* 4 = WALL (solid). You cannot enter 4s.\n* 5 = EXIT indicator (presence of 5s marks/frames the exit area)\n* 8 = LIFE token (count lives as the number of 2×2 blocks of 8s)\n* 9 = blue cells (used in player lower body; also appear elsewhere in the map and in key logic)\n* 12 = orange cells (used in player upper body)\n* 15 = MOVE counter (number of 15s ≈ moves/energy left)\n\n# PLAYER (sprite + movement legality)\n* The player is an 8×8 sprite made ONLY of 12s (top two rows) over 9s (bottom six rows).\n  - Concretely: rows 0–1 (relative to the sprite) are all 12s; rows 2–7 are all 9s.\n  - Other scattered 9s on the board are NOT the player—only the exact 8×8 (2×8 of 12s stacked on 6×8 of 9s) is the player.\n* Movement rules:\n  - You may move only through non-4 cells (i.e., never overlap a 4 after a move).\n  - If any part of your 8×8 sprite would overlap a 4 in the target direction (including cases where 4s lie “under” 9s), that move is ILLEGAL.\n  - If your sprite is already touching 4s on a side, you cannot move further in that touching direction until you have clearance.\n  - Practically: navigate corridors “between the 4s”.\n\n# KEYS, EXIT, AND HOW TO FIND THEM\n* Bottom-left KEY INDICATOR (non-interactive):\n  - A small block of 0s and 9s COMPLETELY BOXED by 4s in the bottom-left of the entire grid.\n  - This is NOT reachable and NOT a gameplay area. It only shows your CURRENT selected key.\n* EXIT (the lock to open):\n  - Elsewhere on the map, the lock is the target 0/9 pattern you must match, adjacent to some 5s (the 5s need not fully surround it).\n  - You may leave the level only when your current key EXACTLY matches this lock’s 0/9 distribution.\n* KEY GENERATOR (interactive, how to generate keys):\n  - Look for a patch consisting of 0s and 9s that has a CLEAR path of 3s leading to it and around it, and is NOT bordered by 5s or boxed by 4s.\n  - When any part of your 8×8 player steps ONTO this patch, it GENERATES a NEW candidate key and updates the bottom-left indicator.\n  - Step OFF the patch and then back ON to generate yet another candidate key; repeat to cycle through the set of keys.\n  - Continue cycling until the bottom-left indicator EXACTLY matches the lock pattern at the exit (the same 0/9 layout adjacent to 5s).\n* Locating things quickly:\n  - Generator: 0/9 patch accessible via 3s, with only 3s around it (no 5s), is almost certainly the generator.\n  - Exit: a matching 0/9 pattern near 5s marks the lock/exit area.\n\n# HUD / PROGRESSION\n* Visual score on the second-to-last grid row (row 62): it contains several 4-cell “slots”.\n  - Slots made of 3s represent UNFINISHED levels.\n  - When a slot changes from 3s to another color, that level is COMPLETE.\n* Track remaining MOVES/ENERGY by counting tiles with value 15.\n* Track LIVES by counting distinct 2×2 blocks of 8s.\n\n# GENERAL NOTES\n* The grid is a bird’s-eye view.\n* If the grid does not change after an action, you likely attempted an illegal move into 4s.\n* Favor routes marked by 3s; use the generator (0/9 patch surrounded by 3s) to cycle keys; confirm the match by comparing the bottom-left indicator (boxed by 4s) to the 0/9 lock pattern found near 5s; then proceed to the exit.\n\n# EXAMPLE STRATEGY OBSERVATION\nThe 8×8 player (top rows 12s, bottom rows 9s) is touching 4s on the left, so LEFT is blocked. I see a 0/9 patch with only 3s around it to the right—that’s likely the generator. I should move RIGHT to step on/off it until the bottom-left indicator (boxed by 4s) matches the lock pattern I see near the 5s, then head to the exit.\n\n# TURN:\nCall exactly one action.\n\n"

    "content": "\n# CONTEXT:\nYou are an agent playing a dynamic game. Your objective is to\nWIN and avoid GAME_OVER while minimizing actions.\n\nOne action produces one Frame. One Frame is made of one or more sequential\nGrids. Each Grid is a matrix size INT<0,63> by INT<0,63> filled with\nINT<0,15> values. Each value represents a different color and usually implies a different object.\n\nYou are playing a game called LockSmith.\n\n# CONTROLS\n* RESET: start over\n* ACTION1: move up\n* ACTION2: move down\n* ACTION3: move left\n* ACTION4: move right\n* ACTION5/ACTION6: no-ops\n\n# ORIENTATION (read carefully)\n* The global frame is fixed: the bottom-left KEY INDICATOR is always at the bottom-left; the EXIT/lock is elsewhere.\n* ACTION1 (UP) moves you toward the area where 15s (move counters) are located; use this as a compass for “up.”\n* ACTION4 (RIGHT) increases your distance from the bottom-left key indicator; ACTION3 (LEFT) decreases it.\n* Legality checks with 4s (walls):\n  - RIGHT is ILLEGAL if any 4s lie immediately to the right (“after” in row order) of any 12/9 cells of your 8×8 player.\n  - LEFT is ILLEGAL if any 4s lie immediately to the left (“before” in row order) of any 12/9 cells of your 8×8 player.\n  - UP is ILLEGAL if any 4s lie directly above the topmost 12 row of your player.\n  - DOWN is ILLEGAL if any 4s lie directly below the bottommost 9 row of your player.\n* Always orient carefully before moving: check where the 15s lie (for UP), how far you are from the bottom-left indicator (for LEFT/RIGHT), and whether 4s precede/follow your 12s/9s in the intended direction.\n\n# GOAL\nFind/generate a key that MATCHES the key pattern shown at the EXIT, then navigate to the EXIT to finish the level.\nThere are 6 levels total. Complete all levels to WIN.\n\n# TILE MEANINGS (important ones)\n* 0 = white cell (used in key patterns)\n* 3 = walkable path / corridor marker (often outlines routes to key/exit)\n* 4 = WALL (solid). You cannot enter 4s.\n* 5 = EXIT indicator (presence of 5s marks/frames the exit area)\n* 8 = LIFE token (count lives as the number of 2×2 blocks of 8s)\n* 9 = blue cells (used in player lower body; also appear elsewhere in the map and in key logic)\n* 12 = orange cells (used in player upper body)\n* 15 = MOVE counter (number of 15s ≈ moves/energy left)\n\n# PLAYER (sprite + movement legality)\n* The player is an 8×8 sprite made ONLY of 12s (top two rows) over 9s (bottom six rows).\n  - Concretely: rows 0–1 (relative to the sprite) are all 12s; rows 2–7 are all 9s.\n  - Other scattered 9s on the board are NOT the player—only the exact 8×8 (2×8 of 12s stacked on 6×8 of 9s) is the player.\n* Movement rules:\n  - You may move only through non-4 cells (i.e., never overlap a 4 after a move).\n  - If any part of your 8×8 sprite would overlap a 4 in the target direction (including cases where 4s lie “under” 9s), that move is ILLEGAL.\n  - If your sprite is already touching 4s on a side, you cannot move further in that touching direction until you have clearance.\n  - Practically: navigate corridors “between the 4s”.\n\n# KEYS, EXIT, AND HOW TO FIND THEM\n* Bottom-left KEY INDICATOR (non-interactive):\n  - A small block of 0s and 9s COMPLETELY BOXED by 4s in the bottom-left of the entire grid.\n  - This is NOT reachable and NOT a gameplay area. It only shows your CURRENT selected key.\n* EXIT (the lock to open):\n  - Elsewhere on the map, the lock is the target 0/9 pattern you must match, adjacent to some 5s (the 5s need not fully surround it).\n  - You may leave the level only when your current key EXACTLY matches this lock’s 0/9 distribution.\n* KEY GENERATOR (interactive, how to generate keys):\n  - Look for a patch consisting of 0s and 9s that has a CLEAR path of 3s leading to it and around it, and is NOT bordered by 5s or boxed by 4s.\n  - When any part of your 8×8 player steps ONTO this patch, it GENERATES a NEW candidate key and updates the bottom-left indicator.\n  - Step OFF the patch and then back ON to generate yet another candidate key; repeat to cycle through the set of keys.\n  - Continue cycling until the bottom-left indicator EXACTLY matches the lock pattern at the exit (the same 0/9 layout adjacent to 5s).\n* Locating things quickly:\n  - Generator: 0/9 patch accessible via 3s, with only 3s around it (no 5s), is almost certainly the generator.\n  - Exit: a matching 0/9 pattern near 5s marks the lock/exit area.\n\n# HUD / PROGRESSION\n* Visual score on the second-to-last grid row (row 62): it contains several 4-cell “slots”.\n  - Slots made of 3s represent UNFINISHED levels.\n  - When a slot changes from 3s to another color, that level is COMPLETE.\n* Track remaining MOVES/ENERGY by counting tiles with value 15.\n* Track LIVES by counting distinct 2×2 blocks of 8s.\n\n# GENERAL NOTES\n* The grid is a bird’s-eye view.\n* If the grid does not change after an action, you likely attempted an illegal move into 4s.\n* Favor routes marked by 3s; use the generator (0/9 patch surrounded by 3s) to cycle keys; confirm the match by comparing the bottom-left indicator (boxed by 4s) to the 0/9 lock pattern found near 5s; then proceed to the exit.\n\n# EXAMPLE STRATEGY OBSERVATION\nThe 8×8 player (top rows 12s, bottom rows 9s) is touching 4s on the left, so LEFT is blocked. I see a 0/9 patch with only 3s around it to the right—that’s likely the generator. I should move RIGHT to step on/off it until the bottom-left indicator (boxed by 4s) matches the lock pattern I see near the 5s, then head to the exit.\n\n# TURN:\nCall exactly one action.\n\n"

    "content": "\n# CONTEXT:\nYou are an agent playing a dynamic game. Your objective is to\nWIN and avoid GAME_OVER while minimizing actions.\n\nOne action produces one Frame. One Frame is made of one or more sequential\nGrids. Each Grid is a matrix size INT<0,63> by INT<0,63> filled with\nINT<0,15> values. Each value represents a different color and usually implies a different object.\n\nYou are playing a game called LockSmith.\n\n# CONTROLS\n* RESET: start over\n* ACTION1: move up\n* ACTION2: move down\n* ACTION3: move left\n* ACTION4: move right\n* ACTION5/ACTION6: no-ops\n\n# ORIENTATION (read carefully)\n* The global frame is fixed: the bottom-left KEY INDICATOR is always at the bottom-left; the EXIT/lock is elsewhere.\n* ACTION1 (UP) moves you toward the area where 15s (move counters) are located; use this as a compass for “up.”\n* ACTION4 (RIGHT) increases your distance from the bottom-left key indicator; ACTION3 (LEFT) decreases it.\n* Legality checks with 4s (walls):\n  - RIGHT is ILLEGAL if any 4s lie immediately to the right (“after” in row order) of any 12/9 cells of your 8×8 player.\n  - LEFT is ILLEGAL if any 4s lie immediately to the left (“before” in row order) of any 12/9 cells of your 8×8 player.\n  - UP is ILLEGAL if any 4s lie directly above the topmost 12 row of your player.\n  - DOWN is ILLEGAL if any 4s lie directly below the bottommost 9 row of your player.\n* Always orient carefully before moving: check where the 15s lie (for UP), how far you are from the bottom-left indicator (for LEFT/RIGHT), and whether 4s precede/follow your 12s/9s in the intended direction.\n\n# GOAL\nFind/generate a key that MATCHES the key pattern shown at the EXIT, then navigate to the EXIT to finish the level.\nThere are 6 levels total. Complete all levels to WIN.\n\n# TILE MEANINGS (important ones)\n* 0 = white cell (used in key patterns)\n* 3 = walkable path / corridor marker (often outlines routes to key/exit)\n* 4 = WALL (solid). You cannot enter 4s.\n* 5 = EXIT indicator (presence of 5s marks/frames the exit area)\n* 8 = LIFE token (count lives as the number of 2×2 blocks of 8s)\n* 9 = blue cells (used in player lower body; also appear elsewhere in the map and in key logic)\n* 12 = orange cells (used in player upper body)\n* 15 = MOVE counter (number of 15s ≈ moves/energy left)\n\n# PLAYER (sprite + movement legality)\n* The player is an 8×8 sprite made ONLY of 12s (top two rows) over 9s (bottom six rows).\n  - Concretely: rows 0–1 (relative to the sprite) are all 12s; rows 2–7 are all 9s.\n  - Other scattered 9s on the board are NOT the player—only the exact 8×8 (2×8 of 12s stacked on 6×8 of 9s) is the player.\n* Movement rules:\n  - You may move only through non-4 cells (i.e., never overlap a 4 after a move).\n  - If any part of your 8×8 sprite would overlap a 4 in the target direction (including cases where 4s lie “under” 9s), that move is ILLEGAL.\n  - If your sprite is already touching 4s on a side, you cannot move further in that touching direction until you have clearance.\n  - Practically: navigate corridors “between the 4s”.\n\n# KEYS, EXIT, AND HOW TO FIND THEM\n* Bottom-left KEY INDICATOR (non-interactive):\n  - A small block of 0s and 9s COMPLETELY BOXED by 4s in the bottom-left of the entire grid.\n  - This is NOT reachable and NOT a gameplay area. It only shows your CURRENT selected key.\n* EXIT (the lock to open):\n  - Elsewhere on the map, the lock is the target 0/9 pattern you must match, adjacent to some 5s (the 5s need not fully surround it).\n  - You may leave the level only when your current key EXACTLY matches this lock’s 0/9 distribution.\n* KEY GENERATOR (interactive, how to generate keys):\n  - Look for a patch consisting of 0s and 9s that has a CLEAR path of 3s leading to it and around it, and is NOT bordered by 5s or boxed by 4s.\n  - When any part of your 8×8 player steps ONTO this patch, it GENERATES a NEW candidate key and updates the bottom-left indicator.\n  - Step OFF the patch and then back ON to generate yet another candidate key; repeat to cycle through the set of keys.\n  - Continue cycling until the bottom-left indicator EXACTLY matches the lock pattern at the exit (the same 0/9 layout adjacent to 5s).\n* Locating things quickly:\n  - Generator: 0/9 patch accessible via 3s, with only 3s around it (no 5s), is almost certainly the generator.\n  - Exit: a matching 0/9 pattern near 5s marks the lock/exit area.\n\n# HUD / PROGRESSION\n* Visual score on the second-to-last grid row (row 62): it contains several 4-cell “slots”.\n  - Slots made of 3s represent UNFINISHED levels.\n  - When a slot changes from 3s to another color, that level is COMPLETE.\n* Track remaining MOVES/ENERGY by counting tiles with value 15.\n* Track LIVES by counting distinct 2×2 blocks of 8s.\n\n# GENERAL NOTES\n* The grid is a bird’s-eye view.\n* If the grid does not change after an action, you likely attempted an illegal move into 4s.\n* Favor routes marked by 3s; use the generator (0/9 patch surrounded by 3s) to cycle keys; confirm the match by comparing the bottom-left indicator (boxed by 4s) to the 0/9 lock pattern found near 5s; then proceed to the exit.\n\n# EXAMPLE STRATEGY OBSERVATION\nThe 8×8 player (top rows 12s, bottom rows 9s) is touching 4s on the left, so LEFT is blocked. I see a 0/9 patch with only 3s around it to the right—that’s likely the generator. I should move RIGHT to step on/off it until the bottom-left indicator (boxed by 4s) matches the lock pattern I see near the 5s, then head to the exit.\n\n# TURN:\nCall exactly one action.\n\n"

    "content": "\n# CONTEXT:\nYou are an agent playing a dynamic game. Your objective is to\nWIN and avoid GAME_OVER while minimizing actions.\n\nOne action produces one Frame. One Frame is made of one or more sequential\nGrids. Each Grid is a matrix size INT<0,63> by INT<0,63> filled with\nINT<0,15> values. Each value represents a different color and usually implies a different object.\n\nYou are playing a game called LockSmith.\n\n# CONTROLS\n* RESET: start over\n* ACTION1: move up\n* ACTION2: move down\n* ACTION3: move left\n* ACTION4: move right\n* ACTION5/ACTION6: no-ops\n\n# ORIENTATION (read carefully)\n* The global frame is fixed: the bottom-left KEY INDICATOR is always at the bottom-left; the EXIT/lock is elsewhere.\n* ACTION1 (UP) moves you toward the area where 15s (move counters) are located; use this as a compass for “up.”\n* ACTION4 (RIGHT) increases your distance from the bottom-left key indicator; ACTION3 (LEFT) decreases it.\n* Legality checks with 4s (walls):\n  - RIGHT is ILLEGAL if any 4s lie immediately to the right (“after” in row order) of any 12/9 cells of your 8×8 player.\n  - LEFT is ILLEGAL if any 4s lie immediately to the left (“before” in row order) of any 12/9 cells of your 8×8 player.\n  - UP is ILLEGAL if any 4s lie directly above the topmost 12 row of your player.\n  - DOWN is ILLEGAL if any 4s lie directly below the bottommost 9 row of your player.\n* Always orient carefully before moving: check where the 15s lie (for UP), how far you are from the bottom-left indicator (for LEFT/RIGHT), and whether 4s precede/follow your 12s/9s in the intended direction.\n\n# GOAL\nFind/generate a key that MATCHES the key pattern shown at the EXIT, then navigate to the EXIT to finish the level.\nThere are 6 levels total. Complete all levels to WIN.\n\n# TILE MEANINGS (important ones)\n* 0 = white cell (used in key patterns)\n* 3 = walkable path / corridor marker (often outlines routes to key/exit)\n* 4 = WALL (solid). You cannot enter 4s.\n* 5 = EXIT indicator (presence of 5s marks/frames the exit area)\n* 8 = LIFE token (count lives as the number of 2×2 blocks of 8s)\n* 9 = blue cells (used in player lower body; also appear elsewhere in the map and in key logic)\n* 12 = orange cells (used in player upper body)\n* 15 = MOVE counter (number of 15s ≈ moves/energy left)\n\n# PLAYER (sprite + movement legality)\n* The player is an 8×8 sprite made ONLY of 12s (top two rows) over 9s (bottom six rows).\n  - Concretely: rows 0–1 (relative to the sprite) are all 12s; rows 2–7 are all 9s.\n  - Other scattered 9s on the board are NOT the player—only the exact 8×8 (2×8 of 12s stacked on 6×8 of 9s) is the player.\n* Movement rules:\n  - You may move only through non-4 cells (i.e., never overlap a 4 after a move).\n  - If any part of your 8×8 sprite would overlap a 4 in the target direction (including cases where 4s lie “under” 9s), that move is ILLEGAL.\n  - If your sprite is already touching 4s on a side, you cannot move further in that touching direction until you have clearance.\n  - Practically: navigate corridors “between the 4s”.\n\n# KEYS, EXIT, AND HOW TO FIND THEM\n* Bottom-left KEY INDICATOR (non-interactive):\n  - A small block of 0s and 9s COMPLETELY BOXED by 4s in the bottom-left of the entire grid.\n  - This is NOT reachable and NOT a gameplay area. It only shows your CURRENT selected key.\n* EXIT (the lock to open):\n  - Elsewhere on the map, the lock is the target 0/9 pattern you must match, adjacent to some 5s (the 5s need not fully surround it).\n  - You may leave the level only when your current key EXACTLY matches this lock’s 0/9 distribution.\n* KEY GENERATOR (interactive, how to generate keys):\n  - Look for a patch consisting of 0s and 9s that has a CLEAR path of 3s leading to it and around it, and is NOT bordered by 5s or boxed by 4s.\n  - When any part of your 8×8 player steps ONTO this patch, it GENERATES a NEW candidate key and updates the bottom-left indicator.\n  - Step OFF the patch and then back ON to generate yet another candidate key; repeat to cycle through the set of keys.\n  - Continue cycling until the bottom-left indicator EXACTLY matches the lock pattern at the exit (the same 0/9 layout adjacent to 5s).\n* Locating things quickly:\n  - Generator: 0/9 patch accessible via 3s, with only 3s around it (no 5s), is almost certainly the generator.\n  - Exit: a matching 0/9 pattern near 5s marks the lock/exit area.\n\n# HUD / PROGRESSION\n* Visual score on the second-to-last grid row (row 62): it contains several 4-cell “slots”.\n  - Slots made of 3s represent UNFINISHED levels.\n  - When a slot changes from 3s to another color, that level is COMPLETE.\n* Track remaining MOVES/ENERGY by counting tiles with value 15.\n* Track LIVES by counting distinct 2×2 blocks of 8s.\n\n# GENERAL NOTES\n* The grid is a bird’s-eye view.\n* If the grid does not change after an action, you likely attempted an illegal move into 4s.\n* Favor routes marked by 3s; use the generator (0/9 patch surrounded by 3s) to cycle keys; confirm the match by comparing the bottom-left indicator (boxed by 4s) to the 0/9 lock pattern found near 5s; then proceed to the exit.\n\n# EXAMPLE STRATEGY OBSERVATION\nThe 8×8 player (top rows 12s, bottom rows 9s) is touching 4s on the left, so LEFT is blocked. I see a 0/9 patch with only 3s around it to the right—that’s likely the generator. I should move RIGHT to step on/off it until the bottom-left indicator (boxed by 4s) matches the lock pattern I see near the 5s, then head to the exit.\n\n# TURN:\nCall exactly one action.\n\n"

    "content": "\n# CONTEXT:\nYou are an agent playing a dynamic game. Your objective is to\nWIN and avoid GAME_OVER while minimizing actions.\n\nOne action produces one Frame. One Frame is made of one or more sequential\nGrids. Each Grid is a matrix size INT<0,63> by INT<0,63> filled with\nINT<0,15> values. Each value represents a different color and usually implies a different object.\n\nYou are playing a game called LockSmith.\n\n# CONTROLS\n* RESET: start over\n* ACTION1: move up\n* ACTION2: move down\n* ACTION3: move left\n* ACTION4: move right\n* ACTION5/ACTION6: no-ops\n\n# ORIENTATION (read carefully)\n* The global frame is fixed: the bottom-left KEY INDICATOR is always at the bottom-left; the EXIT/lock is elsewhere.\n* ACTION1 (UP) moves you toward the area where 15s (move counters) are located; use this as a compass for “up.”\n* ACTION4 (RIGHT) increases your distance from the bottom-left key indicator; ACTION3 (LEFT) decreases it.\n* Legality checks with 4s (walls):\n  - RIGHT is ILLEGAL if any 4s lie immediately to the right (“after” in row order) of any 12/9 cells of your 8×8 player.\n  - LEFT is ILLEGAL if any 4s lie immediately to the left (“before” in row order) of any 12/9 cells of your 8×8 player.\n  - UP is ILLEGAL if any 4s lie directly above the topmost 12 row of your player.\n  - DOWN is ILLEGAL if any 4s lie directly below the bottommost 9 row of your player.\n* Always orient carefully before moving: check where the 15s lie (for UP), how far you are from the bottom-left indicator (for LEFT/RIGHT), and whether 4s precede/follow your 12s/9s in the intended direction.\n\n# GOAL\nFind/generate a key that MATCHES the key pattern shown at the EXIT, then navigate to the EXIT to finish the level.\nThere are 6 levels total. Complete all levels to WIN.\n\n# TILE MEANINGS (important ones)\n* 0 = white cell (used in key patterns)\n* 3 = walkable path / corridor marker (often outlines routes to key/exit)\n* 4 = WALL (solid). You cannot enter 4s.\n* 5 = EXIT indicator (presence of 5s marks/frames the exit area)\n* 8 = LIFE token (count lives as the number of 2×2 blocks of 8s)\n* 9 = blue cells (used in player lower body; also appear elsewhere in the map and in key logic)\n* 12 = orange cells (used in player upper body)\n* 15 = MOVE counter (number of 15s ≈ moves/energy left)\n\n# PLAYER (sprite + movement legality)\n* The player is an 8×8 sprite made ONLY of 12s (top two rows) over 9s (bottom six rows).\n  - Concretely: rows 0–1 (relative to the sprite) are all 12s; rows 2–7 are all 9s.\n  - Other scattered 9s on the board are NOT the player—only the exact 8×8 (2×8 of 12s stacked on 6×8 of 9s) is the player.\n* Movement rules:\n  - You may move only through non-4 cells (i.e., never overlap a 4 after a move).\n  - If any part of your 8×8 sprite would overlap a 4 in the target direction (including cases where 4s lie “under” 9s), that move is ILLEGAL.\n  - If your sprite is already touching 4s on a side, you cannot move further in that touching direction until you have clearance.\n  - Practically: navigate corridors “between the 4s”.\n\n# KEYS, EXIT, AND HOW TO FIND THEM\n* Bottom-left KEY INDICATOR (non-interactive):\n  - A small block of 0s and 9s COMPLETELY BOXED by 4s in the bottom-left of the entire grid.\n  - This is NOT reachable and NOT a gameplay area. It only shows your CURRENT selected key.\n* EXIT (the lock to open):\n  - Elsewhere on the map, the lock is the target 0/9 pattern you must match, adjacent to some 5s (the 5s need not fully surround it).\n  - You may leave the level only when your current key EXACTLY matches this lock’s 0/9 distribution.\n* KEY GENERATOR (interactive, how to generate keys):\n  - Look for a patch consisting of 0s and 9s that has a CLEAR path of 3s leading to it and around it, and is NOT bordered by 5s or boxed by 4s.\n  - When any part of your 8×8 player steps ONTO this patch, it GENERATES a NEW candidate key and updates the bottom-left indicator.\n  - Step OFF the patch and then back ON to generate yet another candidate key; repeat to cycle through the set of keys.\n  - Continue cycling until the bottom-left indicator EXACTLY matches the lock pattern at the exit (the same 0/9 layout adjacent to 5s).\n* Locating things quickly:\n  - Generator: 0/9 patch accessible via 3s, with only 3s around it (no 5s), is almost certainly the generator.\n  - Exit: a matching 0/9 pattern near 5s marks the lock/exit area.\n\n# HUD / PROGRESSION\n* Visual score on the second-to-last grid row (row 62): it contains several 4-cell “slots”.\n  - Slots made of 3s represent UNFINISHED levels.\n  - When a slot changes from 3s to another color, that level is COMPLETE.\n* Track remaining MOVES/ENERGY by counting tiles with value 15.\n* Track LIVES by counting distinct 2×2 blocks of 8s.\n\n# GENERAL NOTES\n* The grid is a bird’s-eye view.\n* If the grid does not change after an action, you likely attempted an illegal move into 4s.\n* Favor routes marked by 3s; use the generator (0/9 patch surrounded by 3s) to cycle keys; confirm the match by comparing the bottom-left indicator (boxed by 4s) to the 0/9 lock pattern found near 5s; then proceed to the exit.\n\n# EXAMPLE STRATEGY OBSERVATION\nThe 8×8 player (top rows 12s, bottom rows 9s) is touching 4s on the left, so LEFT is blocked. I see a 0/9 patch with only 3s around it to the right—that’s likely the generator. I should move RIGHT to step on/off it until the bottom-left indicator (boxed by 4s) matches the lock pattern I see near the 5s, then head to the exit.\n\n# TURN:\nCall exactly one action.\n\n"

    "content": "\n# CONTEXT:\nYou are an agent playing a dynamic game. Your objective is to\nWIN and avoid GAME_OVER while minimizing actions.\n\nOne action produces one Frame. One Frame is made of one or more sequential\nGrids. Each Grid is a matrix size INT<0,63> by INT<0,63> filled with\nINT<0,15> values. Each value represents a different color and usually implies a different object.\n\nYou are playing a game called LockSmith.\n\n# CONTROLS\n* RESET: start over\n* ACTION1: move up\n* ACTION2: move down\n* ACTION3: move left\n* ACTION4: move right\n* ACTION5/ACTION6: no-ops\n\n# ORIENTATION (read carefully)\n* The global frame is fixed: the bottom-left KEY INDICATOR is always at the bottom-left; the EXIT/lock is elsewhere.\n* ACTION1 (UP) moves you toward the area where 15s (move counters) are located; use this as a compass for “up.”\n* ACTION4 (RIGHT) increases your distance from the bottom-left key indicator; ACTION3 (LEFT) decreases it.\n* Legality checks with 4s (walls):\n  - RIGHT is ILLEGAL if any 4s lie immediately to the right (“after” in row order) of any 12/9 cells of your 8×8 player.\n  - LEFT is ILLEGAL if any 4s lie immediately to the left (“before” in row order) of any 12/9 cells of your 8×8 player.\n  - UP is ILLEGAL if any 4s lie directly above the topmost 12 row of your player.\n  - DOWN is ILLEGAL if any 4s lie directly below the bottommost 9 row of your player.\n* Always orient carefully before moving: check where the 15s lie (for UP), how far you are from the bottom-left indicator (for LEFT/RIGHT), and whether 4s precede/follow your 12s/9s in the intended direction.\n\n# GOAL\nFind/generate a key that MATCHES the key pattern shown at the EXIT, then navigate to the EXIT to finish the level.\nThere are 6 levels total. Complete all levels to WIN.\n\n# TILE MEANINGS (important ones)\n* 0 = white cell (used in key patterns)\n* 3 = walkable path / corridor marker (often outlines routes to key/exit)\n* 4 = WALL (solid). You cannot enter 4s.\n* 5 = EXIT indicator (presence of 5s marks/frames the exit area)\n* 8 = LIFE token (count lives as the number of 2×2 blocks of 8s)\n* 9 = blue cells (used in player lower body; also appear elsewhere in the map and in key logic)\n* 12 = orange cells (used in player upper body)\n* 15 = MOVE counter (number of 15s ≈ moves/energy left)\n\n# PLAYER (sprite + movement legality)\n* The player is an 8×8 sprite made ONLY of 12s (top two rows) over 9s (bottom six rows).\n  - Concretely: rows 0–1 (relative to the sprite) are all 12s; rows 2–7 are all 9s.\n  - Other scattered 9s on the board are NOT the player—only the exact 8×8 (2×8 of 12s stacked on 6×8 of 9s) is the player.\n* Movement rules:\n  - You may move only through non-4 cells (i.e., never overlap a 4 after a move).\n  - If any part of your 8×8 sprite would overlap a 4 in the target direction (including cases where 4s lie “under” 9s), that move is ILLEGAL.\n  - If your sprite is already touching 4s on a side, you cannot move further in that touching direction until you have clearance.\n  - Practically: navigate corridors “between the 4s”.\n\n# KEYS, EXIT, AND HOW TO FIND THEM\n* Bottom-left KEY INDICATOR (non-interactive):\n  - A small block of 0s and 9s COMPLETELY BOXED by 4s in the bottom-left of the entire grid.\n  - This is NOT reachable and NOT a gameplay area. It only shows your CURRENT selected key.\n* EXIT (the lock to open):\n  - Elsewhere on the map, the lock is the target 0/9 pattern you must match, adjacent to some 5s (the 5s need not fully surround it).\n  - You may leave the level only when your current key EXACTLY matches this lock’s 0/9 distribution.\n* KEY GENERATOR (interactive, how to generate keys):\n  - Look for a patch consisting of 0s and 9s that has a CLEAR path of 3s leading to it and around it, and is NOT bordered by 5s or boxed by 4s.\n  - When any part of your 8×8 player steps ONTO this patch, it GENERATES a NEW candidate key and updates the bottom-left indicator.\n  - Step OFF the patch and then back ON to generate yet another candidate key; repeat to cycle through the set of keys.\n  - Continue cycling until the bottom-left indicator EXACTLY matches the lock pattern at the exit (the same 0/9 layout adjacent to 5s).\n* Locating things quickly:\n  - Generator: 0/9 patch accessible via 3s, with only 3s around it (no 5s), is almost certainly the generator.\n  - Exit: a matching 0/9 pattern near 5s marks the lock/exit area.\n\n# HUD / PROGRESSION\n* Visual score on the second-to-last grid row (row 62): it contains several 4-cell “slots”.\n  - Slots made of 3s represent UNFINISHED levels.\n  - When a slot changes from 3s to another color, that level is COMPLETE.\n* Track remaining MOVES/ENERGY by counting tiles with value 15.\n* Track LIVES by counting distinct 2×2 blocks of 8s.\n\n# GENERAL NOTES\n* The grid is a bird’s-eye view.\n* If the grid does not change after an action, you likely attempted an illegal move into 4s.\n* Favor routes marked by 3s; use the generator (0/9 patch surrounded by 3s) to cycle keys; confirm the match by comparing the bottom-left indicator (boxed by 4s) to the 0/9 lock pattern found near 5s; then proceed to the exit.\n\n# EXAMPLE STRATEGY OBSERVATION\nThe 8×8 player (top rows 12s, bottom rows 9s) is touching 4s on the left, so LEFT is blocked. I see a 0/9 patch with only 3s around it to the right—that’s likely the generator. I should move RIGHT to step on/off it until the bottom-left indicator (boxed by 4s) matches the lock pattern I see near the 5s, then head to the exit.\n\n# TURN:\nCall exactly one action.\n\n"

    "content": "\n# CONTEXT:\nYou are an agent playing a dynamic game. Your objective is to\nWIN and avoid GAME_OVER while minimizing actions.\n\nOne action produces one Frame. One Frame is made of one or more sequential\nGrids. Each Grid is a matrix size INT<0,63> by INT<0,63> filled with\nINT<0,15> values. Each value represents a different color and usually implies a different object.\n\nYou are playing a game called LockSmith.\n\n# CONTROLS\n* RESET: start over\n* ACTION1: move up\n* ACTION2: move down\n* ACTION3: move left\n* ACTION4: move right\n* ACTION5/ACTION6: no-ops\n\n# ORIENTATION (read carefully)\n* The global frame is fixed: the bottom-left KEY INDICATOR is always at the bottom-left; the EXIT/lock is elsewhere.\n* ACTION1 (UP) moves you toward the area where 15s (move counters) are located; use this as a compass for “up.”\n* ACTION4 (RIGHT) increases your distance from the bottom-left key indicator; ACTION3 (LEFT) decreases it.\n* Legality checks with 4s (walls):\n  - RIGHT is ILLEGAL if any 4s lie immediately to the right (“after” in row order) of any 12/9 cells of your 8×8 player.\n  - LEFT is ILLEGAL if any 4s lie immediately to the left (“before” in row order) of any 12/9 cells of your 8×8 player.\n  - UP is ILLEGAL if any 4s lie directly above the topmost 12 row of your player.\n  - DOWN is ILLEGAL if any 4s lie directly below the bottommost 9 row of your player.\n* Always orient carefully before moving: check where the 15s lie (for UP), how far you are from the bottom-left indicator (for LEFT/RIGHT), and whether 4s precede/follow your 12s/9s in the intended direction.\n\n# GOAL\nFind/generate a key that MATCHES the key pattern shown at the EXIT, then navigate to the EXIT to finish the level.\nThere are 6 levels total. Complete all levels to WIN.\n\n# TILE MEANINGS (important ones)\n* 0 = white cell (used in key patterns)\n* 3 = walkable path / corridor marker (often outlines routes to key/exit)\n* 4 = WALL (solid). You cannot enter 4s.\n* 5 = EXIT indicator (presence of 5s marks/frames the exit area)\n* 8 = LIFE token (count lives as the number of 2×2 blocks of 8s)\n* 9 = blue cells (used in player lower body; also appear elsewhere in the map and in key logic)\n* 12 = orange cells (used in player upper body)\n* 15 = MOVE counter (number of 15s ≈ moves/energy left)\n\n# PLAYER (sprite + movement legality)\n* The player is an 8×8 sprite made ONLY of 12s (top two rows) over 9s (bottom six rows).\n  - Concretely: rows 0–1 (relative to the sprite) are all 12s; rows 2–7 are all 9s.\n  - Other scattered 9s on the board are NOT the player—only the exact 8×8 (2×8 of 12s stacked on 6×8 of 9s) is the player.\n* Movement rules:\n  - You may move only through non-4 cells (i.e., never overlap a 4 after a move).\n  - If any part of your 8×8 sprite would overlap a 4 in the target direction (including cases where 4s lie “under” 9s), that move is ILLEGAL.\n  - If your sprite is already touching 4s on a side, you cannot move further in that touching direction until you have clearance.\n  - Practically: navigate corridors “between the 4s”.\n\n# KEYS, EXIT, AND HOW TO FIND THEM\n* Bottom-left KEY INDICATOR (non-interactive):\n  - A small block of 0s and 9s COMPLETELY BOXED by 4s in the bottom-left of the entire grid.\n  - This is NOT reachable and NOT a gameplay area. It only shows your CURRENT selected key.\n* EXIT (the lock to open):\n  - Elsewhere on the map, the lock is the target 0/9 pattern you must match, adjacent to some 5s (the 5s need not fully surround it).\n  - You may leave the level only when your current key EXACTLY matches this lock’s 0/9 distribution.\n* KEY GENERATOR (interactive, how to generate keys):\n  - Look for a patch consisting of 0s and 9s that has a CLEAR path of 3s leading to it and around it, and is NOT bordered by 5s or boxed by 4s.\n  - When any part of your 8×8 player steps ONTO this patch, it GENERATES a NEW candidate key and updates the bottom-left indicator.\n  - Step OFF the patch and then back ON to generate yet another candidate key; repeat to cycle through the set of keys.\n  - Continue cycling until the bottom-left indicator EXACTLY matches the lock pattern at the exit (the same 0/9 layout adjacent to 5s).\n* Locating things quickly:\n  - Generator: 0/9 patch accessible via 3s, with only 3s around it (no 5s), is almost certainly the generator.\n  - Exit: a matching 0/9 pattern near 5s marks the lock/exit area.\n\n# HUD / PROGRESSION\n* Visual score on the second-to-last grid row (row 62): it contains several 4-cell “slots”.\n  - Slots made of 3s represent UNFINISHED levels.\n  - When a slot changes from 3s to another color, that level is COMPLETE.\n* Track remaining MOVES/ENERGY by counting tiles with value 15.\n* Track LIVES by counting distinct 2×2 blocks of 8s.\n\n# GENERAL NOTES\n* The grid is a bird’s-eye view.\n* If the grid does not change after an action, you likely attempted an illegal move into 4s.\n* Favor routes marked by 3s; use the generator (0/9 patch surrounded by 3s) to cycle keys; confirm the match by comparing the bottom-left indicator (boxed by 4s) to the 0/9 lock pattern found near 5s; then proceed to the exit.\n\n# EXAMPLE STRATEGY OBSERVATION\nThe 8×8 player (top rows 12s, bottom rows 9s) is touching 4s on the left, so LEFT is blocked. I see a 0/9 patch with only 3s around it to the right—that’s likely the generator. I should move RIGHT to step on/off it until the bottom-left indicator (boxed by 4s) matches the lock pattern I see near the 5s, then head to the exit.\n\n# TURN:\nCall exactly one action.\n\n"

    "content": "\n# CONTEXT:\nYou are an agent playing a dynamic game. Your objective is to\nWIN and avoid GAME_OVER while minimizing actions.\n\nOne action produces one Frame. One Frame is made of one or more sequential\nGrids. Each Grid is a matrix size INT<0,63> by INT<0,63> filled with\nINT<0,15> values. Each value represents a different color and usually implies a different object.\n\nYou are playing a game called LockSmith.\n\n# CONTROLS\n* RESET: start over\n* ACTION1: move up\n* ACTION2: move down\n* ACTION3: move left\n* ACTION4: move right\n* ACTION5/ACTION6: no-ops\n\n# ORIENTATION (read carefully)\n* The global frame is fixed: the bottom-left KEY INDICATOR is always at the bottom-left; the EXIT/lock is elsewhere.\n* ACTION1 (UP) moves you toward the area where 15s (move counters) are located; use this as a compass for “up.”\n* ACTION4 (RIGHT) increases your distance from the bottom-left key indicator; ACTION3 (LEFT) decreases it.\n* Legality checks with 4s (walls):\n  - RIGHT is ILLEGAL if any 4s lie immediately to the right (“after” in row order) of any 12/9 cells of your 8×8 player.\n  - LEFT is ILLEGAL if any 4s lie immediately to the left (“before” in row order) of any 12/9 cells of your 8×8 player.\n  - UP is ILLEGAL if any 4s lie directly above the topmost 12 row of your player.\n  - DOWN is ILLEGAL if any 4s lie directly below the bottommost 9 row of your player.\n* Always orient carefully before moving: check where the 15s lie (for UP), how far you are from the bottom-left indicator (for LEFT/RIGHT), and whether 4s precede/follow your 12s/9s in the intended direction.\n\n# GOAL\nFind/generate a key that MATCHES the key pattern shown at the EXIT, then navigate to the EXIT to finish the level.\nThere are 6 levels total. Complete all levels to WIN.\n\n# TILE MEANINGS (important ones)\n* 0 = white cell (used in key patterns)\n* 3 = walkable path / corridor marker (often outlines routes to key/exit)\n* 4 = WALL (solid). You cannot enter 4s.\n* 5 = EXIT indicator (presence of 5s marks/frames the exit area)\n* 8 = LIFE token (count lives as the number of 2×2 blocks of 8s)\n* 9 = blue cells (used in player lower body; also appear elsewhere in the map and in key logic)\n* 12 = orange cells (used in player upper body)\n* 15 = MOVE counter (number of 15s ≈ moves/energy left)\n\n# PLAYER (sprite + movement legality)\n* The player is an 8×8 sprite made ONLY of 12s (top two rows) over 9s (bottom six rows).\n  - Concretely: rows 0–1 (relative to the sprite) are all 12s; rows 2–7 are all 9s.\n  - Other scattered 9s on the board are NOT the player—only the exact 8×8 (2×8 of 12s stacked on 6×8 of 9s) is the player.\n* Movement rules:\n  - You may move only through non-4 cells (i.e., never overlap a 4 after a move).\n  - If any part of your 8×8 sprite would overlap a 4 in the target direction (including cases where 4s lie “under” 9s), that move is ILLEGAL.\n  - If your sprite is already touching 4s on a side, you cannot move further in that touching direction until you have clearance.\n  - Practically: navigate corridors “between the 4s”.\n\n# KEYS, EXIT, AND HOW TO FIND THEM\n* Bottom-left KEY INDICATOR (non-interactive):\n  - A small block of 0s and 9s COMPLETELY BOXED by 4s in the bottom-left of the entire grid.\n  - This is NOT reachable and NOT a gameplay area. It only shows your CURRENT selected key.\n* EXIT (the lock to open):\n  - Elsewhere on the map, the lock is the target 0/9 pattern you must match, adjacent to some 5s (the 5s need not fully surround it).\n  - You may leave the level only when your current key EXACTLY matches this lock’s 0/9 distribution.\n* KEY GENERATOR (interactive, how to generate keys):\n  - Look for a patch consisting of 0s and 9s that has a CLEAR path of 3s leading to it and around it, and is NOT bordered by 5s or boxed by 4s.\n  - When any part of your 8×8 player steps ONTO this patch, it GENERATES a NEW candidate key and updates the bottom-left indicator.\n  - Step OFF the patch and then back ON to generate yet another candidate key; repeat to cycle through the set of keys.\n  - Continue cycling until the bottom-left indicator EXACTLY matches the lock pattern at the exit (the same 0/9 layout adjacent to 5s).\n* Locating things quickly:\n  - Generator: 0/9 patch accessible via 3s, with only 3s around it (no 5s), is almost certainly the generator.\n  - Exit: a matching 0/9 pattern near 5s marks the lock/exit area.\n\n# HUD / PROGRESSION\n* Visual score on the second-to-last grid row (row 62): it contains several 4-cell “slots”.\n  - Slots made of 3s represent UNFINISHED levels.\n  - When a slot changes from 3s to another color, that level is COMPLETE.\n* Track remaining MOVES/ENERGY by counting tiles with value 15.\n* Track LIVES by counting distinct 2×2 blocks of 8s.\n\n# GENERAL NOTES\n* The grid is a bird’s-eye view.\n* If the grid does not change after an action, you likely attempted an illegal move into 4s.\n* Favor routes marked by 3s; use the generator (0/9 patch surrounded by 3s) to cycle keys; confirm the match by comparing the bottom-left indicator (boxed by 4s) to the 0/9 lock pattern found near 5s; then proceed to the exit.\n\n# EXAMPLE STRATEGY OBSERVATION\nThe 8×8 player (top rows 12s, bottom rows 9s) is touching 4s on the left, so LEFT is blocked. I see a 0/9 patch with only 3s around it to the right—that’s likely the generator. I should move RIGHT to step on/off it until the bottom-left indicator (boxed by 4s) matches the lock pattern I see near the 5s, then head to the exit.\n\n# TURN:\nCall exactly one action.\n\n"

    "content": "\n# CONTEXT:\nYou are an agent playing a dynamic game. Your objective is to\nWIN and avoid GAME_OVER while minimizing actions.\n\nOne action produces one Frame. One Frame is made of one or more sequential\nGrids. Each Grid is a matrix size INT<0,63> by INT<0,63> filled with\nINT<0,15> values. Each value represents a different color and usually implies a different object.\n\nYou are playing a game called LockSmith.\n\n# CONTROLS\n* RESET: start over\n* ACTION1: move up\n* ACTION2: move down\n* ACTION3: move left\n* ACTION4: move right\n* ACTION5/ACTION6: no-ops\n\n# ORIENTATION (read carefully)\n* The global frame is fixed: the bottom-left KEY INDICATOR is always at the bottom-left; the EXIT/lock is elsewhere.\n* ACTION1 (UP) moves you toward the area where 15s (move counters) are located; use this as a compass for “up.”\n* ACTION4 (RIGHT) increases your distance from the bottom-left key indicator; ACTION3 (LEFT) decreases it.\n* Legality checks with 4s (walls):\n  - RIGHT is ILLEGAL if any 4s lie immediately to the right (“after” in row order) of any 12/9 cells of your 8×8 player.\n  - LEFT is ILLEGAL if any 4s lie immediately to the left (“before” in row order) of any 12/9 cells of your 8×8 player.\n  - UP is ILLEGAL if any 4s lie directly above the topmost 12 row of your player.\n  - DOWN is ILLEGAL if any 4s lie directly below the bottommost 9 row of your player.\n* Always orient carefully before moving: check where the 15s lie (for UP), how far you are from the bottom-left indicator (for LEFT/RIGHT), and whether 4s precede/follow your 12s/9s in the intended direction.\n\n# GOAL\nFind/generate a key that MATCHES the key pattern shown at the EXIT, then navigate to the EXIT to finish the level.\nThere are 6 levels total. Complete all levels to WIN.\n\n# TILE MEANINGS (important ones)\n* 0 = white cell (used in key patterns)\n* 3 = walkable path / corridor marker (often outlines routes to key/exit)\n* 4 = WALL (solid). You cannot enter 4s.\n* 5 = EXIT indicator (presence of 5s marks/frames the exit area)\n* 8 = LIFE token (count lives as the number of 2×2 blocks of 8s)\n* 9 = blue cells (used in player lower body; also appear elsewhere in the map and in key logic)\n* 12 = orange cells (used in player upper body)\n* 15 = MOVE counter (number of 15s ≈ moves/energy left)\n\n# PLAYER (sprite + movement legality)\n* The player is an 8×8 sprite made ONLY of 12s (top two rows) over 9s (bottom six rows).\n  - Concretely: rows 0–1 (relative to the sprite) are all 12s; rows 2–7 are all 9s.\n  - Other scattered 9s on the board are NOT the player—only the exact 8×8 (2×8 of 12s stacked on 6×8 of 9s) is the player.\n* Movement rules:\n  - You may move only through non-4 cells (i.e., never overlap a 4 after a move).\n  - If any part of your 8×8 sprite would overlap a 4 in the target direction (including cases where 4s lie “under” 9s), that move is ILLEGAL.\n  - If your sprite is already touching 4s on a side, you cannot move further in that touching direction until you have clearance.\n  - Practically: navigate corridors “between the 4s”.\n\n# KEYS, EXIT, AND HOW TO FIND THEM\n* Bottom-left KEY INDICATOR (non-interactive):\n  - A small block of 0s and 9s COMPLETELY BOXED by 4s in the bottom-left of the entire grid.\n  - This is NOT reachable and NOT a gameplay area. It only shows your CURRENT selected key.\n* EXIT (the lock to open):\n  - Elsewhere on the map, the lock is the target 0/9 pattern you must match, adjacent to some 5s (the 5s need not fully surround it).\n  - You may leave the level only when your current key EXACTLY matches this lock’s 0/9 distribution.\n* KEY GENERATOR (interactive, how to generate keys):\n  - Look for a patch consisting of 0s and 9s that has a CLEAR path of 3s leading to it and around it, and is NOT bordered by 5s or boxed by 4s.\n  - When any part of your 8×8 player steps ONTO this patch, it GENERATES a NEW candidate key and updates the bottom-left indicator.\n  - Step OFF the patch and then back ON to generate yet another candidate key; repeat to cycle through the set of keys.\n  - Continue cycling until the bottom-left indicator EXACTLY matches the lock pattern at the exit (the same 0/9 layout adjacent to 5s).\n* Locating things quickly:\n  - Generator: 0/9 patch accessible via 3s, with only 3s around it (no 5s), is almost certainly the generator.\n  - Exit: a matching 0/9 pattern near 5s marks the lock/exit area.\n\n# HUD / PROGRESSION\n* Visual score on the second-to-last grid row (row 62): it contains several 4-cell “slots”.\n  - Slots made of 3s represent UNFINISHED levels.\n  - When a slot changes from 3s to another color, that level is COMPLETE.\n* Track remaining MOVES/ENERGY by counting tiles with value 15.\n* Track LIVES by counting distinct 2×2 blocks of 8s.\n\n# GENERAL NOTES\n* The grid is a bird’s-eye view.\n* If the grid does not change after an action, you likely attempted an illegal move into 4s.\n* Favor routes marked by 3s; use the generator (0/9 patch surrounded by 3s) to cycle keys; confirm the match by comparing the bottom-left indicator (boxed by 4s) to the 0/9 lock pattern found near 5s; then proceed to the exit.\n\n# EXAMPLE STRATEGY OBSERVATION\nThe 8×8 player (top rows 12s, bottom rows 9s) is touching 4s on the left, so LEFT is blocked. I see a 0/9 patch with only 3s around it to the right—that’s likely the generator. I should move RIGHT to step on/off it until the bottom-left indicator (boxed by 4s) matches the lock pattern I see near the 5s, then head to the exit.\n\n# TURN:\nCall exactly one action.\n\n"

    "content": "\n# CONTEXT:\nYou are an agent playing a dynamic game. Your objective is to\nWIN and avoid GAME_OVER while minimizing actions.\n\nOne action produces one Frame. One Frame is made of one or more sequential\nGrids. Each Grid is a matrix size INT<0,63> by INT<0,63> filled with\nINT<0,15> values. Each value represents a different color and usually implies a different object.\n\nYou are playing a game called LockSmith.\n\n# CONTROLS\n* RESET: start over\n* ACTION1: move up\n* ACTION2: move down\n* ACTION3: move left\n* ACTION4: move right\n* ACTION5/ACTION6: no-ops\n\n# ORIENTATION (read carefully)\n* The global frame is fixed: the bottom-left KEY INDICATOR is always at the bottom-left; the EXIT/lock is elsewhere.\n* ACTION1 (UP) moves you toward the area where 15s (move counters) are located; use this as a compass for “up.”\n* ACTION4 (RIGHT) increases your distance from the bottom-left key indicator; ACTION3 (LEFT) decreases it.\n* Legality checks with 4s (walls):\n  - RIGHT is ILLEGAL if any 4s lie immediately to the right (“after” in row order) of any 12/9 cells of your 8×8 player.\n  - LEFT is ILLEGAL if any 4s lie immediately to the left (“before” in row order) of any 12/9 cells of your 8×8 player.\n  - UP is ILLEGAL if any 4s lie directly above the topmost 12 row of your player.\n  - DOWN is ILLEGAL if any 4s lie directly below the bottommost 9 row of your player.\n* Always orient carefully before moving: check where the 15s lie (for UP), how far you are from the bottom-left indicator (for LEFT/RIGHT), and whether 4s precede/follow your 12s/9s in the intended direction.\n\n# GOAL\nFind/generate a key that MATCHES the key pattern shown at the EXIT, then navigate to the EXIT to finish the level.\nThere are 6 levels total. Complete all levels to WIN.\n\n# TILE MEANINGS (important ones)\n* 0 = white cell (used in key patterns)\n* 3 = walkable path / corridor marker (often outlines routes to key/exit)\n* 4 = WALL (solid). You cannot enter 4s.\n* 5 = EXIT indicator (presence of 5s marks/frames the exit area)\n* 8 = LIFE token (count lives as the number of 2×2 blocks of 8s)\n* 9 = blue cells (used in player lower body; also appear elsewhere in the map and in key logic)\n* 12 = orange cells (used in player upper body)\n* 15 = MOVE counter (number of 15s ≈ moves/energy left)\n\n# PLAYER (sprite + movement legality)\n* The player is an 8×8 sprite made ONLY of 12s (top two rows) over 9s (bottom six rows).\n  - Concretely: rows 0–1 (relative to the sprite) are all 12s; rows 2–7 are all 9s.\n  - Other scattered 9s on the board are NOT the player—only the exact 8×8 (2×8 of 12s stacked on 6×8 of 9s) is the player.\n* Movement rules:\n  - You may move only through non-4 cells (i.e., never overlap a 4 after a move).\n  - If any part of your 8×8 sprite would overlap a 4 in the target direction (including cases where 4s lie “under” 9s), that move is ILLEGAL.\n  - If your sprite is already touching 4s on a side, you cannot move further in that touching direction until you have clearance.\n  - Practically: navigate corridors “between the 4s”.\n\n# KEYS, EXIT, AND HOW TO FIND THEM\n* Bottom-left KEY INDICATOR (non-interactive):\n  - A small block of 0s and 9s COMPLETELY BOXED by 4s in the bottom-left of the entire grid.\n  - This is NOT reachable and NOT a gameplay area. It only shows your CURRENT selected key.\n* EXIT (the lock to open):\n  - Elsewhere on the map, the lock is the target 0/9 pattern you must match, adjacent to some 5s (the 5s need not fully surround it).\n  - You may leave the level only when your current key EXACTLY matches this lock’s 0/9 distribution.\n* KEY GENERATOR (interactive, how to generate keys):\n  - Look for a patch consisting of 0s and 9s that has a CLEAR path of 3s leading to it and around it, and is NOT bordered by 5s or boxed by 4s.\n  - When any part of your 8×8 player steps ONTO this patch, it GENERATES a NEW candidate key and updates the bottom-left indicator.\n  - Step OFF the patch and then back ON to generate yet another candidate key; repeat to cycle through the set of keys.\n  - Continue cycling until the bottom-left indicator EXACTLY matches the lock pattern at the exit (the same 0/9 layout adjacent to 5s).\n* Locating things quickly:\n  - Generator: 0/9 patch accessible via 3s, with only 3s around it (no 5s), is almost certainly the generator.\n  - Exit: a matching 0/9 pattern near 5s marks the lock/exit area.\n\n# HUD / PROGRESSION\n* Visual score on the second-to-last grid row (row 62): it contains several 4-cell “slots”.\n  - Slots made of 3s represent UNFINISHED levels.\n  - When a slot changes from 3s to another color, that level is COMPLETE.\n* Track remaining MOVES/ENERGY by counting tiles with value 15.\n* Track LIVES by counting distinct 2×2 blocks of 8s.\n\n# GENERAL NOTES\n* The grid is a bird’s-eye view.\n* If the grid does not change after an action, you likely attempted an illegal move into 4s.\n* Favor routes marked by 3s; use the generator (0/9 patch surrounded by 3s) to cycle keys; confirm the match by comparing the bottom-left indicator (boxed by 4s) to the 0/9 lock pattern found near 5s; then proceed to the exit.\n\n# EXAMPLE STRATEGY OBSERVATION\nThe 8×8 player (top rows 12s, bottom rows 9s) is touching 4s on the left, so LEFT is blocked. I see a 0/9 patch with only 3s around it to the right—that’s likely the generator. I should move RIGHT to step on/off it until the bottom-left indicator (boxed by 4s) matches the lock pattern I see near the 5s, then head to the exit.\n\n# TURN:\nCall exactly one action.\n\n"

    "content": "\n# CONTEXT:\nYou are an agent playing a dynamic game. Your objective is to\nWIN and avoid GAME_OVER while minimizing actions.\n\nOne action produces one Frame. One Frame is made of one or more sequential\nGrids. Each Grid is a matrix size INT<0,63> by INT<0,63> filled with\nINT<0,15> values. Each value represents a different color and usually implies a different object.\n\nYou are playing a game called LockSmith.\n\n# CONTROLS\n* RESET: start over\n* ACTION1: move up\n* ACTION2: move down\n* ACTION3: move left\n* ACTION4: move right\n* ACTION5/ACTION6: no-ops\n\n# ORIENTATION (read carefully)\n* The global frame is fixed: the bottom-left KEY INDICATOR is always at the bottom-left; the EXIT/lock is elsewhere.\n* ACTION1 (UP) moves you toward the area where 15s (move counters) are located; use this as a compass for “up.”\n* ACTION4 (RIGHT) increases your distance from the bottom-left key indicator; ACTION3 (LEFT) decreases it.\n* Legality checks with 4s (walls):\n  - RIGHT is ILLEGAL if any 4s lie immediately to the right (“after” in row order) of any 12/9 cells of your 8×8 player.\n  - LEFT is ILLEGAL if any 4s lie immediately to the left (“before” in row order) of any 12/9 cells of your 8×8 player.\n  - UP is ILLEGAL if any 4s lie directly above the topmost 12 row of your player.\n  - DOWN is ILLEGAL if any 4s lie directly below the bottommost 9 row of your player.\n* Always orient carefully before moving: check where the 15s lie (for UP), how far you are from the bottom-left indicator (for LEFT/RIGHT), and whether 4s precede/follow your 12s/9s in the intended direction.\n\n# GOAL\nFind/generate a key that MATCHES the key pattern shown at the EXIT, then navigate to the EXIT to finish the level.\nThere are 6 levels total. Complete all levels to WIN.\n\n# TILE MEANINGS (important ones)\n* 0 = white cell (used in key patterns)\n* 3 = walkable path / corridor marker (often outlines routes to key/exit)\n* 4 = WALL (solid). You cannot enter 4s.\n* 5 = EXIT indicator (presence of 5s marks/frames the exit area)\n* 8 = LIFE token (count lives as the number of 2×2 blocks of 8s)\n* 9 = blue cells (used in player lower body; also appear elsewhere in the map and in key logic)\n* 12 = orange cells (used in player upper body)\n* 15 = MOVE counter (number of 15s ≈ moves/energy left)\n\n# PLAYER (sprite + movement legality)\n* The player is an 8×8 sprite made ONLY of 12s (top two rows) over 9s (bottom six rows).\n  - Concretely: rows 0–1 (relative to the sprite) are all 12s; rows 2–7 are all 9s.\n  - Other scattered 9s on the board are NOT the player—only the exact 8×8 (2×8 of 12s stacked on 6×8 of 9s) is the player.\n* Movement rules:\n  - You may move only through non-4 cells (i.e., never overlap a 4 after a move).\n  - If any part of your 8×8 sprite would overlap a 4 in the target direction (including cases where 4s lie “under” 9s), that move is ILLEGAL.\n  - If your sprite is already touching 4s on a side, you cannot move further in that touching direction until you have clearance.\n  - Practically: navigate corridors “between the 4s”.\n\n# KEYS, EXIT, AND HOW TO FIND THEM\n* Bottom-left KEY INDICATOR (non-interactive):\n  - A small block of 0s and 9s COMPLETELY BOXED by 4s in the bottom-left of the entire grid.\n  - This is NOT reachable and NOT a gameplay area. It only shows your CURRENT selected key.\n* EXIT (the lock to open):\n  - Elsewhere on the map, the lock is the target 0/9 pattern you must match, adjacent to some 5s (the 5s need not fully surround it).\n  - You may leave the level only when your current key EXACTLY matches this lock’s 0/9 distribution.\n* KEY GENERATOR (interactive, how to generate keys):\n  - Look for a patch consisting of 0s and 9s that has a CLEAR path of 3s leading to it and around it, and is NOT bordered by 5s or boxed by 4s.\n  - When any part of your 8×8 player steps ONTO this patch, it GENERATES a NEW candidate key and updates the bottom-left indicator.\n  - Step OFF the patch and then back ON to generate yet another candidate key; repeat to cycle through the set of keys.\n  - Continue cycling until the bottom-left indicator EXACTLY matches the lock pattern at the exit (the same 0/9 layout adjacent to 5s).\n* Locating things quickly:\n  - Generator: 0/9 patch accessible via 3s, with only 3s around it (no 5s), is almost certainly the generator.\n  - Exit: a matching 0/9 pattern near 5s marks the lock/exit area.\n\n# HUD / PROGRESSION\n* Visual score on the second-to-last grid row (row 62): it contains several 4-cell “slots”.\n  - Slots made of 3s represent UNFINISHED levels.\n  - When a slot changes from 3s to another color, that level is COMPLETE.\n* Track remaining MOVES/ENERGY by counting tiles with value 15.\n* Track LIVES by counting distinct 2×2 blocks of 8s.\n\n# GENERAL NOTES\n* The grid is a bird’s-eye view.\n* If the grid does not change after an action, you likely attempted an illegal move into 4s.\n* Favor routes marked by 3s; use the generator (0/9 patch surrounded by 3s) to cycle keys; confirm the match by comparing the bottom-left indicator (boxed by 4s) to the 0/9 lock pattern found near 5s; then proceed to the exit.\n\n# EXAMPLE STRATEGY OBSERVATION\nThe 8×8 player (top rows 12s, bottom rows 9s) is touching 4s on the left, so LEFT is blocked. I see a 0/9 patch with only 3s around it to the right—that’s likely the generator. I should move RIGHT to step on/off it until the bottom-left indicator (boxed by 4s) matches the lock pattern I see near the 5s, then head to the exit.\n\n# TURN:\nCall exactly one action.\n\n"

    "content": "\n# CONTEXT:\nYou are an agent playing a dynamic game. Your objective is to\nWIN and avoid GAME_OVER while minimizing actions.\n\nOne action produces one Frame. One Frame is made of one or more sequential\nGrids. Each Grid is a matrix size INT<0,63> by INT<0,63> filled with\nINT<0,15> values. Each value represents a different color and usually implies a different object.\n\nYou are playing a game called LockSmith.\n\n# CONTROLS\n* RESET: start over\n* ACTION1: move up\n* ACTION2: move down\n* ACTION3: move left\n* ACTION4: move right\n* ACTION5/ACTION6: no-ops\n\n# ORIENTATION (read carefully)\n* The global frame is fixed: the bottom-left KEY INDICATOR is always at the bottom-left; the EXIT/lock is elsewhere.\n* ACTION1 (UP) moves you toward the area where 15s (move counters) are located; use this as a compass for “up.”\n* ACTION4 (RIGHT) increases your distance from the bottom-left key indicator; ACTION3 (LEFT) decreases it.\n* Legality checks with 4s (walls):\n  - RIGHT is ILLEGAL if any 4s lie immediately to the right (“after” in row order) of any 12/9 cells of your 8×8 player.\n  - LEFT is ILLEGAL if any 4s lie immediately to the left (“before” in row order) of any 12/9 cells of your 8×8 player.\n  - UP is ILLEGAL if any 4s lie directly above the topmost 12 row of your player.\n  - DOWN is ILLEGAL if any 4s lie directly below the bottommost 9 row of your player.\n* Always orient carefully before moving: check where the 15s lie (for UP), how far you are from the bottom-left indicator (for LEFT/RIGHT), and whether 4s precede/follow your 12s/9s in the intended direction.\n\n# GOAL\nFind/generate a key that MATCHES the key pattern shown at the EXIT, then navigate to the EXIT to finish the level.\nThere are 6 levels total. Complete all levels to WIN.\n\n# TILE MEANINGS (important ones)\n* 0 = white cell (used in key patterns)\n* 3 = walkable path / corridor marker (often outlines routes to key/exit)\n* 4 = WALL (solid). You cannot enter 4s.\n* 5 = EXIT indicator (presence of 5s marks/frames the exit area)\n* 8 = LIFE token (count lives as the number of 2×2 blocks of 8s)\n* 9 = blue cells (used in player lower body; also appear elsewhere in the map and in key logic)\n* 12 = orange cells (used in player upper body)\n* 15 = MOVE counter (number of 15s ≈ moves/energy left)\n\n# PLAYER (sprite + movement legality)\n* The player is an 8×8 sprite made ONLY of 12s (top two rows) over 9s (bottom six rows).\n  - Concretely: rows 0–1 (relative to the sprite) are all 12s; rows 2–7 are all 9s.\n  - Other scattered 9s on the board are NOT the player—only the exact 8×8 (2×8 of 12s stacked on 6×8 of 9s) is the player.\n* Movement rules:\n  - You may move only through non-4 cells (i.e., never overlap a 4 after a move).\n  - If any part of your 8×8 sprite would overlap a 4 in the target direction (including cases where 4s lie “under” 9s), that move is ILLEGAL.\n  - If your sprite is already touching 4s on a side, you cannot move further in that touching direction until you have clearance.\n  - Practically: navigate corridors “between the 4s”.\n\n# KEYS, EXIT, AND HOW TO FIND THEM\n* Bottom-left KEY INDICATOR (non-interactive):\n  - A small block of 0s and 9s COMPLETELY BOXED by 4s in the bottom-left of the entire grid.\n  - This is NOT reachable and NOT a gameplay area. It only shows your CURRENT selected key.\n* EXIT (the lock to open):\n  - Elsewhere on the map, the lock is the target 0/9 pattern you must match, adjacent to some 5s (the 5s need not fully surround it).\n  - You may leave the level only when your current key EXACTLY matches this lock’s 0/9 distribution.\n* KEY GENERATOR (interactive, how to generate keys):\n  - Look for a patch consisting of 0s and 9s that has a CLEAR path of 3s leading to it and around it, and is NOT bordered by 5s or boxed by 4s.\n  - When any part of your 8×8 player steps ONTO this patch, it GENERATES a NEW candidate key and updates the bottom-left indicator.\n  - Step OFF the patch and then back ON to generate yet another candidate key; repeat to cycle through the set of keys.\n  - Continue cycling until the bottom-left indicator EXACTLY matches the lock pattern at the exit (the same 0/9 layout adjacent to 5s).\n* Locating things quickly:\n  - Generator: 0/9 patch accessible via 3s, with only 3s around it (no 5s), is almost certainly the generator.\n  - Exit: a matching 0/9 pattern near 5s marks the lock/exit area.\n\n# HUD / PROGRESSION\n* Visual score on the second-to-last grid row (row 62): it contains several 4-cell “slots”.\n  - Slots made of 3s represent UNFINISHED levels.\n  - When a slot changes from 3s to another color, that level is COMPLETE.\n* Track remaining MOVES/ENERGY by counting tiles with value 15.\n* Track LIVES by counting distinct 2×2 blocks of 8s.\n\n# GENERAL NOTES\n* The grid is a bird’s-eye view.\n* If the grid does not change after an action, you likely attempted an illegal move into 4s.\n* Favor routes marked by 3s; use the generator (0/9 patch surrounded by 3s) to cycle keys; confirm the match by comparing the bottom-left indicator (boxed by 4s) to the 0/9 lock pattern found near 5s; then proceed to the exit.\n\n# EXAMPLE STRATEGY OBSERVATION\nThe 8×8 player (top rows 12s, bottom rows 9s) is touching 4s on the left, so LEFT is blocked. I see a 0/9 patch with only 3s around it to the right—that’s likely the generator. I should move RIGHT to step on/off it until the bottom-left indicator (boxed by 4s) matches the lock pattern I see near the 5s, then head to the exit.\n\n# TURN:\nCall exactly one action.\n\n"

    "content": "\n# CONTEXT:\nYou are an agent playing a dynamic game. Your objective is to\nWIN and avoid GAME_OVER while minimizing actions.\n\nOne action produces one Frame. One Frame is made of one or more sequential\nGrids. Each Grid is a matrix size INT<0,63> by INT<0,63> filled with\nINT<0,15> values. Each value represents a different color and usually implies a different object.\n\nYou are playing a game called LockSmith.\n\n# CONTROLS\n* RESET: start over\n* ACTION1: move up\n* ACTION2: move down\n* ACTION3: move left\n* ACTION4: move right\n* ACTION5/ACTION6: no-ops\n\n# ORIENTATION (read carefully)\n* The global frame is fixed: the bottom-left KEY INDICATOR is always at the bottom-left; the EXIT/lock is elsewhere.\n* ACTION1 (UP) moves you toward the area where 15s (move counters) are located; use this as a compass for “up.”\n* ACTION4 (RIGHT) increases your distance from the bottom-left key indicator; ACTION3 (LEFT) decreases it.\n* Legality checks with 4s (walls):\n  - RIGHT is ILLEGAL if any 4s lie immediately to the right (“after” in row order) of any 12/9 cells of your 8×8 player.\n  - LEFT is ILLEGAL if any 4s lie immediately to the left (“before” in row order) of any 12/9 cells of your 8×8 player.\n  - UP is ILLEGAL if any 4s lie directly above the topmost 12 row of your player.\n  - DOWN is ILLEGAL if any 4s lie directly below the bottommost 9 row of your player.\n* Always orient carefully before moving: check where the 15s lie (for UP), how far you are from the bottom-left indicator (for LEFT/RIGHT), and whether 4s precede/follow your 12s/9s in the intended direction.\n\n# GOAL\nFind/generate a key that MATCHES the key pattern shown at the EXIT, then navigate to the EXIT to finish the level.\nThere are 6 levels total. Complete all levels to WIN.\n\n# TILE MEANINGS (important ones)\n* 0 = white cell (used in key patterns)\n* 3 = walkable path / corridor marker (often outlines routes to key/exit)\n* 4 = WALL (solid). You cannot enter 4s.\n* 5 = EXIT indicator (presence of 5s marks/frames the exit area)\n* 8 = LIFE token (count lives as the number of 2×2 blocks of 8s)\n* 9 = blue cells (used in player lower body; also appear elsewhere in the map and in key logic)\n* 12 = orange cells (used in player upper body)\n* 15 = MOVE counter (number of 15s ≈ moves/energy left)\n\n# PLAYER (sprite + movement legality)\n* The player is an 8×8 sprite made ONLY of 12s (top two rows) over 9s (bottom six rows).\n  - Concretely: rows 0–1 (relative to the sprite) are all 12s; rows 2–7 are all 9s.\n  - Other scattered 9s on the board are NOT the player—only the exact 8×8 (2×8 of 12s stacked on 6×8 of 9s) is the player.\n* Movement rules:\n  - You may move only through non-4 cells (i.e., never overlap a 4 after a move).\n  - If any part of your 8×8 sprite would overlap a 4 in the target direction (including cases where 4s lie “under” 9s), that move is ILLEGAL.\n  - If your sprite is already touching 4s on a side, you cannot move further in that touching direction until you have clearance.\n  - Practically: navigate corridors “between the 4s”.\n\n# KEYS, EXIT, AND HOW TO FIND THEM\n* Bottom-left KEY INDICATOR (non-interactive):\n  - A small block of 0s and 9s COMPLETELY BOXED by 4s in the bottom-left of the entire grid.\n  - This is NOT reachable and NOT a gameplay area. It only shows your CURRENT selected key.\n* EXIT (the lock to open):\n  - Elsewhere on the map, the lock is the target 0/9 pattern you must match, adjacent to some 5s (the 5s need not fully surround it).\n  - You may leave the level only when your current key EXACTLY matches this lock’s 0/9 distribution.\n* KEY GENERATOR (interactive, how to generate keys):\n  - Look for a patch consisting of 0s and 9s that has a CLEAR path of 3s leading to it and around it, and is NOT bordered by 5s or boxed by 4s.\n  - When any part of your 8×8 player steps ONTO this patch, it GENERATES a NEW candidate key and updates the bottom-left indicator.\n  - Step OFF the patch and then back ON to generate yet another candidate key; repeat to cycle through the set of keys.\n  - Continue cycling until the bottom-left indicator EXACTLY matches the lock pattern at the exit (the same 0/9 layout adjacent to 5s).\n* Locating things quickly:\n  - Generator: 0/9 patch accessible via 3s, with only 3s around it (no 5s), is almost certainly the generator.\n  - Exit: a matching 0/9 pattern near 5s marks the lock/exit area.\n\n# HUD / PROGRESSION\n* Visual score on the second-to-last grid row (row 62): it contains several 4-cell “slots”.\n  - Slots made of 3s represent UNFINISHED levels.\n  - When a slot changes from 3s to another color, that level is COMPLETE.\n* Track remaining MOVES/ENERGY by counting tiles with value 15.\n* Track LIVES by counting distinct 2×2 blocks of 8s.\n\n# GENERAL NOTES\n* The grid is a bird’s-eye view.\n* If the grid does not change after an action, you likely attempted an illegal move into 4s.\n* Favor routes marked by 3s; use the generator (0/9 patch surrounded by 3s) to cycle keys; confirm the match by comparing the bottom-left indicator (boxed by 4s) to the 0/9 lock pattern found near 5s; then proceed to the exit.\n\n# EXAMPLE STRATEGY OBSERVATION\nThe 8×8 player (top rows 12s, bottom rows 9s) is touching 4s on the left, so LEFT is blocked. I see a 0/9 patch with only 3s around it to the right—that’s likely the generator. I should move RIGHT to step on/off it until the bottom-left indicator (boxed by 4s) matches the lock pattern I see near the 5s, then head to the exit.\n\n# TURN:\nCall exactly one action.\n\n"

    "content": "\n# CONTEXT:\nYou are an agent playing a dynamic game. Your objective is to\nWIN and avoid GAME_OVER while minimizing actions.\n\nOne action produces one Frame. One Frame is made of one or more sequential\nGrids. Each Grid is a matrix size INT<0,63> by INT<0,63> filled with\nINT<0,15> values. Each value represents a different color and usually implies a different object.\n\nYou are playing a game called LockSmith.\n\n# CONTROLS\n* RESET: start over\n* ACTION1: move up\n* ACTION2: move down\n* ACTION3: move left\n* ACTION4: move right\n* ACTION5/ACTION6: no-ops\n\n# ORIENTATION (read carefully)\n* The global frame is fixed: the bottom-left KEY INDICATOR is always at the bottom-left; the EXIT/lock is elsewhere.\n* ACTION1 (UP) moves you toward the area where 15s (move counters) are located; use this as a compass for “up.”\n* ACTION4 (RIGHT) increases your distance from the bottom-left key indicator; ACTION3 (LEFT) decreases it.\n* Legality checks with 4s (walls):\n  - RIGHT is ILLEGAL if any 4s lie immediately to the right (“after” in row order) of any 12/9 cells of your 8×8 player.\n  - LEFT is ILLEGAL if any 4s lie immediately to the left (“before” in row order) of any 12/9 cells of your 8×8 player.\n  - UP is ILLEGAL if any 4s lie directly above the topmost 12 row of your player.\n  - DOWN is ILLEGAL if any 4s lie directly below the bottommost 9 row of your player.\n* Always orient carefully before moving: check where the 15s lie (for UP), how far you are from the bottom-left indicator (for LEFT/RIGHT), and whether 4s precede/follow your 12s/9s in the intended direction.\n\n# GOAL\nFind/generate a key that MATCHES the key pattern shown at the EXIT, then navigate to the EXIT to finish the level.\nThere are 6 levels total. Complete all levels to WIN.\n\n# TILE MEANINGS (important ones)\n* 0 = white cell (used in key patterns)\n* 3 = walkable path / corridor marker (often outlines routes to key/exit)\n* 4 = WALL (solid). You cannot enter 4s.\n* 5 = EXIT indicator (presence of 5s marks/frames the exit area)\n* 8 = LIFE token (count lives as the number of 2×2 blocks of 8s)\n* 9 = blue cells (used in player lower body; also appear elsewhere in the map and in key logic)\n* 12 = orange cells (used in player upper body)\n* 15 = MOVE counter (number of 15s ≈ moves/energy left)\n\n# PLAYER (sprite + movement legality)\n* The player is an 8×8 sprite made ONLY of 12s (top two rows) over 9s (bottom six rows).\n  - Concretely: rows 0–1 (relative to the sprite) are all 12s; rows 2–7 are all 9s.\n  - Other scattered 9s on the board are NOT the player—only the exact 8×8 (2×8 of 12s stacked on 6×8 of 9s) is the player.\n* Movement rules:\n  - You may move only through non-4 cells (i.e., never overlap a 4 after a move).\n  - If any part of your 8×8 sprite would overlap a 4 in the target direction (including cases where 4s lie “under” 9s), that move is ILLEGAL.\n  - If your sprite is already touching 4s on a side, you cannot move further in that touching direction until you have clearance.\n  - Practically: navigate corridors “between the 4s”.\n\n# KEYS, EXIT, AND HOW TO FIND THEM\n* Bottom-left KEY INDICATOR (non-interactive):\n  - A small block of 0s and 9s COMPLETELY BOXED by 4s in the bottom-left of the entire grid.\n  - This is NOT reachable and NOT a gameplay area. It only shows your CURRENT selected key.\n* EXIT (the lock to open):\n  - Elsewhere on the map, the lock is the target 0/9 pattern you must match, adjacent to some 5s (the 5s need not fully surround it).\n  - You may leave the level only when your current key EXACTLY matches this lock’s 0/9 distribution.\n* KEY GENERATOR (interactive, how to generate keys):\n  - Look for a patch consisting of 0s and 9s that has a CLEAR path of 3s leading to it and around it, and is NOT bordered by 5s or boxed by 4s.\n  - When any part of your 8×8 player steps ONTO this patch, it GENERATES a NEW candidate key and updates the bottom-left indicator.\n  - Step OFF the patch and then back ON to generate yet another candidate key; repeat to cycle through the set of keys.\n  - Continue cycling until the bottom-left indicator EXACTLY matches the lock pattern at the exit (the same 0/9 layout adjacent to 5s).\n* Locating things quickly:\n  - Generator: 0/9 patch accessible via 3s, with only 3s around it (no 5s), is almost certainly the generator.\n  - Exit: a matching 0/9 pattern near 5s marks the lock/exit area.\n\n# HUD / PROGRESSION\n* Visual score on the second-to-last grid row (row 62): it contains several 4-cell “slots”.\n  - Slots made of 3s represent UNFINISHED levels.\n  - When a slot changes from 3s to another color, that level is COMPLETE.\n* Track remaining MOVES/ENERGY by counting tiles with value 15.\n* Track LIVES by counting distinct 2×2 blocks of 8s.\n\n# GENERAL NOTES\n* The grid is a bird’s-eye view.\n* If the grid does not change after an action, you likely attempted an illegal move into 4s.\n* Favor routes marked by 3s; use the generator (0/9 patch surrounded by 3s) to cycle keys; confirm the match by comparing the bottom-left indicator (boxed by 4s) to the 0/9 lock pattern found near 5s; then proceed to the exit.\n\n# EXAMPLE STRATEGY OBSERVATION\nThe 8×8 player (top rows 12s, bottom rows 9s) is touching 4s on the left, so LEFT is blocked. I see a 0/9 patch with only 3s around it to the right—that’s likely the generator. I should move RIGHT to step on/off it until the bottom-left indicator (boxed by 4s) matches the lock pattern I see near the 5s, then head to the exit.\n\n# TURN:\nCall exactly one action.\n\n"

    "content": "\n# CONTEXT:\nYou are an agent playing a dynamic game. Your objective is to\nWIN and avoid GAME_OVER while minimizing actions.\n\nOne action produces one Frame. One Frame is made of one or more sequential\nGrids. Each Grid is a matrix size INT<0,63> by INT<0,63> filled with\nINT<0,15> values. Each value represents a different color and usually implies a different object.\n\nYou are playing a game called LockSmith.\n\n# CONTROLS\n* RESET: start over\n* ACTION1: move up\n* ACTION2: move down\n* ACTION3: move left\n* ACTION4: move right\n* ACTION5/ACTION6: no-ops\n\n# ORIENTATION (read carefully)\n* The global frame is fixed: the bottom-left KEY INDICATOR is always at the bottom-left; the EXIT/lock is elsewhere.\n* ACTION1 (UP) moves you toward the area where 15s (move counters) are located; use this as a compass for “up.”\n* ACTION4 (RIGHT) increases your distance from the bottom-left key indicator; ACTION3 (LEFT) decreases it.\n* Legality checks with 4s (walls):\n  - RIGHT is ILLEGAL if any 4s lie immediately to the right (“after” in row order) of any 12/9 cells of your 8×8 player.\n  - LEFT is ILLEGAL if any 4s lie immediately to the left (“before” in row order) of any 12/9 cells of your 8×8 player.\n  - UP is ILLEGAL if any 4s lie directly above the topmost 12 row of your player.\n  - DOWN is ILLEGAL if any 4s lie directly below the bottommost 9 row of your player.\n* Always orient carefully before moving: check where the 15s lie (for UP), how far you are from the bottom-left indicator (for LEFT/RIGHT), and whether 4s precede/follow your 12s/9s in the intended direction.\n\n# GOAL\nFind/generate a key that MATCHES the key pattern shown at the EXIT, then navigate to the EXIT to finish the level.\nThere are 6 levels total. Complete all levels to WIN.\n\n# TILE MEANINGS (important ones)\n* 0 = white cell (used in key patterns)\n* 3 = walkable path / corridor marker (often outlines routes to key/exit)\n* 4 = WALL (solid). You cannot enter 4s.\n* 5 = EXIT indicator (presence of 5s marks/frames the exit area)\n* 8 = LIFE token (count lives as the number of 2×2 blocks of 8s)\n* 9 = blue cells (used in player lower body; also appear elsewhere in the map and in key logic)\n* 12 = orange cells (used in player upper body)\n* 15 = MOVE counter (number of 15s ≈ moves/energy left)\n\n# PLAYER (sprite + movement legality)\n* The player is an 8×8 sprite made ONLY of 12s (top two rows) over 9s (bottom six rows).\n  - Concretely: rows 0–1 (relative to the sprite) are all 12s; rows 2–7 are all 9s.\n  - Other scattered 9s on the board are NOT the player—only the exact 8×8 (2×8 of 12s stacked on 6×8 of 9s) is the player.\n* Movement rules:\n  - You may move only through non-4 cells (i.e., never overlap a 4 after a move).\n  - If any part of your 8×8 sprite would overlap a 4 in the target direction (including cases where 4s lie “under” 9s), that move is ILLEGAL.\n  - If your sprite is already touching 4s on a side, you cannot move further in that touching direction until you have clearance.\n  - Practically: navigate corridors “between the 4s”.\n\n# KEYS, EXIT, AND HOW TO FIND THEM\n* Bottom-left KEY INDICATOR (non-interactive):\n  - A small block of 0s and 9s COMPLETELY BOXED by 4s in the bottom-left of the entire grid.\n  - This is NOT reachable and NOT a gameplay area. It only shows your CURRENT selected key.\n* EXIT (the lock to open):\n  - Elsewhere on the map, the lock is the target 0/9 pattern you must match, adjacent to some 5s (the 5s need not fully surround it).\n  - You may leave the level only when your current key EXACTLY matches this lock’s 0/9 distribution.\n* KEY GENERATOR (interactive, how to generate keys):\n  - Look for a patch consisting of 0s and 9s that has a CLEAR path of 3s leading to it and around it, and is NOT bordered by 5s or boxed by 4s.\n  - When any part of your 8×8 player steps ONTO this patch, it GENERATES a NEW candidate key and updates the bottom-left indicator.\n  - Step OFF the patch and then back ON to generate yet another candidate key; repeat to cycle through the set of keys.\n  - Continue cycling until the bottom-left indicator EXACTLY matches the lock pattern at the exit (the same 0/9 layout adjacent to 5s).\n* Locating things quickly:\n  - Generator: 0/9 patch accessible via 3s, with only 3s around it (no 5s), is almost certainly the generator.\n  - Exit: a matching 0/9 pattern near 5s marks the lock/exit area.\n\n# HUD / PROGRESSION\n* Visual score on the second-to-last grid row (row 62): it contains several 4-cell “slots”.\n  - Slots made of 3s represent UNFINISHED levels.\n  - When a slot changes from 3s to another color, that level is COMPLETE.\n* Track remaining MOVES/ENERGY by counting tiles with value 15.\n* Track LIVES by counting distinct 2×2 blocks of 8s.\n\n# GENERAL NOTES\n* The grid is a bird’s-eye view.\n* If the grid does not change after an action, you likely attempted an illegal move into 4s.\n* Favor routes marked by 3s; use the generator (0/9 patch surrounded by 3s) to cycle keys; confirm the match by comparing the bottom-left indicator (boxed by 4s) to the 0/9 lock pattern found near 5s; then proceed to the exit.\n\n# EXAMPLE STRATEGY OBSERVATION\nThe 8×8 player (top rows 12s, bottom rows 9s) is touching 4s on the left, so LEFT is blocked. I see a 0/9 patch with only 3s around it to the right—that’s likely the generator. I should move RIGHT to step on/off it until the bottom-left indicator (boxed by 4s) matches the lock pattern I see near the 5s, then head to the exit.\n\n# TURN:\nCall exactly one action.\n\n"

    "content": "\n# CONTEXT:\nYou are an agent playing a dynamic game. Your objective is to\nWIN and avoid GAME_OVER while minimizing actions.\n\nOne action produces one Frame. One Frame is made of one or more sequential\nGrids. Each Grid is a matrix size INT<0,63> by INT<0,63> filled with\nINT<0,15> values. Each value represents a different color and usually implies a different object.\n\nYou are playing a game called LockSmith.\n\n# CONTROLS\n* RESET: start over\n* ACTION1: move up\n* ACTION2: move down\n* ACTION3: move left\n* ACTION4: move right\n* ACTION5/ACTION6: no-ops\n\n# ORIENTATION (read carefully)\n* The global frame is fixed: the bottom-left KEY INDICATOR is always at the bottom-left; the EXIT/lock is elsewhere.\n* ACTION1 (UP) moves you toward the area where 15s (move counters) are located; use this as a compass for “up.”\n* ACTION4 (RIGHT) increases your distance from the bottom-left key indicator; ACTION3 (LEFT) decreases it.\n* Legality checks with 4s (walls):\n  - RIGHT is ILLEGAL if any 4s lie immediately to the right (“after” in row order) of any 12/9 cells of your 8×8 player.\n  - LEFT is ILLEGAL if any 4s lie immediately to the left (“before” in row order) of any 12/9 cells of your 8×8 player.\n  - UP is ILLEGAL if any 4s lie directly above the topmost 12 row of your player.\n  - DOWN is ILLEGAL if any 4s lie directly below the bottommost 9 row of your player.\n* Always orient carefully before moving: check where the 15s lie (for UP), how far you are from the bottom-left indicator (for LEFT/RIGHT), and whether 4s precede/follow your 12s/9s in the intended direction.\n\n# GOAL\nFind/generate a key that MATCHES the key pattern shown at the EXIT, then navigate to the EXIT to finish the level.\nThere are 6 levels total. Complete all levels to WIN.\n\n# TILE MEANINGS (important ones)\n* 0 = white cell (used in key patterns)\n* 3 = walkable path / corridor marker (often outlines routes to key/exit)\n* 4 = WALL (solid). You cannot enter 4s.\n* 5 = EXIT indicator (presence of 5s marks/frames the exit area)\n* 8 = LIFE token (count lives as the number of 2×2 blocks of 8s)\n* 9 = blue cells (used in player lower body; also appear elsewhere in the map and in key logic)\n* 12 = orange cells (used in player upper body)\n* 15 = MOVE counter (number of 15s ≈ moves/energy left)\n\n# PLAYER (sprite + movement legality)\n* The player is an 8×8 sprite made ONLY of 12s (top two rows) over 9s (bottom six rows).\n  - Concretely: rows 0–1 (relative to the sprite) are all 12s; rows 2–7 are all 9s.\n  - Other scattered 9s on the board are NOT the player—only the exact 8×8 (2×8 of 12s stacked on 6×8 of 9s) is the player.\n* Movement rules:\n  - You may move only through non-4 cells (i.e., never overlap a 4 after a move).\n  - If any part of your 8×8 sprite would overlap a 4 in the target direction (including cases where 4s lie “under” 9s), that move is ILLEGAL.\n  - If your sprite is already touching 4s on a side, you cannot move further in that touching direction until you have clearance.\n  - Practically: navigate corridors “between the 4s”.\n\n# KEYS, EXIT, AND HOW TO FIND THEM\n* Bottom-left KEY INDICATOR (non-interactive):\n  - A small block of 0s and 9s COMPLETELY BOXED by 4s in the bottom-left of the entire grid.\n  - This is NOT reachable and NOT a gameplay area. It only shows your CURRENT selected key.\n* EXIT (the lock to open):\n  - Elsewhere on the map, the lock is the target 0/9 pattern you must match, adjacent to some 5s (the 5s need not fully surround it).\n  - You may leave the level only when your current key EXACTLY matches this lock’s 0/9 distribution.\n* KEY GENERATOR (interactive, how to generate keys):\n  - Look for a patch consisting of 0s and 9s that has a CLEAR path of 3s leading to it and around it, and is NOT bordered by 5s or boxed by 4s.\n  - When any part of your 8×8 player steps ONTO this patch, it GENERATES a NEW candidate key and updates the bottom-left indicator.\n  - Step OFF the patch and then back ON to generate yet another candidate key; repeat to cycle through the set of keys.\n  - Continue cycling until the bottom-left indicator EXACTLY matches the lock pattern at the exit (the same 0/9 layout adjacent to 5s).\n* Locating things quickly:\n  - Generator: 0/9 patch accessible via 3s, with only 3s around it (no 5s), is almost certainly the generator.\n  - Exit: a matching 0/9 pattern near 5s marks the lock/exit area.\n\n# HUD / PROGRESSION\n* Visual score on the second-to-last grid row (row 62): it contains several 4-cell “slots”.\n  - Slots made of 3s represent UNFINISHED levels.\n  - When a slot changes from 3s to another color, that level is COMPLETE.\n* Track remaining MOVES/ENERGY by counting tiles with value 15.\n* Track LIVES by counting distinct 2×2 blocks of 8s.\n\n# GENERAL NOTES\n* The grid is a bird’s-eye view.\n* If the grid does not change after an action, you likely attempted an illegal move into 4s.\n* Favor routes marked by 3s; use the generator (0/9 patch surrounded by 3s) to cycle keys; confirm the match by comparing the bottom-left indicator (boxed by 4s) to the 0/9 lock pattern found near 5s; then proceed to the exit.\n\n# EXAMPLE STRATEGY OBSERVATION\nThe 8×8 player (top rows 12s, bottom rows 9s) is touching 4s on the left, so LEFT is blocked. I see a 0/9 patch with only 3s around it to the right—that’s likely the generator. I should move RIGHT to step on/off it until the bottom-left indicator (boxed by 4s) matches the lock pattern I see near the 5s, then head to the exit.\n\n# TURN:\nCall exactly one action.\n\n"

    "content": "\n# CONTEXT:\nYou are an agent playing a dynamic game. Your objective is to\nWIN and avoid GAME_OVER while minimizing actions.\n\nOne action produces one Frame. One Frame is made of one or more sequential\nGrids. Each Grid is a matrix size INT<0,63> by INT<0,63> filled with\nINT<0,15> values. Each value represents a different color and usually implies a different object.\n\nYou are playing a game called LockSmith.\n\n# CONTROLS\n* RESET: start over\n* ACTION1: move up\n* ACTION2: move down\n* ACTION3: move left\n* ACTION4: move right\n* ACTION5/ACTION6: no-ops\n\n# ORIENTATION (read carefully)\n* The global frame is fixed: the bottom-left KEY INDICATOR is always at the bottom-left; the EXIT/lock is elsewhere.\n* ACTION1 (UP) moves you toward the area where 15s (move counters) are located; use this as a compass for “up.”\n* ACTION4 (RIGHT) increases your distance from the bottom-left key indicator; ACTION3 (LEFT) decreases it.\n* Legality checks with 4s (walls):\n  - RIGHT is ILLEGAL if any 4s lie immediately to the right (“after” in row order) of any 12/9 cells of your 8×8 player.\n  - LEFT is ILLEGAL if any 4s lie immediately to the left (“before” in row order) of any 12/9 cells of your 8×8 player.\n  - UP is ILLEGAL if any 4s lie directly above the topmost 12 row of your player.\n  - DOWN is ILLEGAL if any 4s lie directly below the bottommost 9 row of your player.\n* Always orient carefully before moving: check where the 15s lie (for UP), how far you are from the bottom-left indicator (for LEFT/RIGHT), and whether 4s precede/follow your 12s/9s in the intended direction.\n\n# GOAL\nFind/generate a key that MATCHES the key pattern shown at the EXIT, then navigate to the EXIT to finish the level.\nThere are 6 levels total. Complete all levels to WIN.\n\n# TILE MEANINGS (important ones)\n* 0 = white cell (used in key patterns)\n* 3 = walkable path / corridor marker (often outlines routes to key/exit)\n* 4 = WALL (solid). You cannot enter 4s.\n* 5 = EXIT indicator (presence of 5s marks/frames the exit area)\n* 8 = LIFE token (count lives as the number of 2×2 blocks of 8s)\n* 9 = blue cells (used in player lower body; also appear elsewhere in the map and in key logic)\n* 12 = orange cells (used in player upper body)\n* 15 = MOVE counter (number of 15s ≈ moves/energy left)\n\n# PLAYER (sprite + movement legality)\n* The player is an 8×8 sprite made ONLY of 12s (top two rows) over 9s (bottom six rows).\n  - Concretely: rows 0–1 (relative to the sprite) are all 12s; rows 2–7 are all 9s.\n  - Other scattered 9s on the board are NOT the player—only the exact 8×8 (2×8 of 12s stacked on 6×8 of 9s) is the player.\n* Movement rules:\n  - You may move only through non-4 cells (i.e., never overlap a 4 after a move).\n  - If any part of your 8×8 sprite would overlap a 4 in the target direction (including cases where 4s lie “under” 9s), that move is ILLEGAL.\n  - If your sprite is already touching 4s on a side, you cannot move further in that touching direction until you have clearance.\n  - Practically: navigate corridors “between the 4s”.\n\n# KEYS, EXIT, AND HOW TO FIND THEM\n* Bottom-left KEY INDICATOR (non-interactive):\n  - A small block of 0s and 9s COMPLETELY BOXED by 4s in the bottom-left of the entire grid.\n  - This is NOT reachable and NOT a gameplay area. It only shows your CURRENT selected key.\n* EXIT (the lock to open):\n  - Elsewhere on the map, the lock is the target 0/9 pattern you must match, adjacent to some 5s (the 5s need not fully surround it).\n  - You may leave the level only when your current key EXACTLY matches this lock’s 0/9 distribution.\n* KEY GENERATOR (interactive, how to generate keys):\n  - Look for a patch consisting of 0s and 9s that has a CLEAR path of 3s leading to it and around it, and is NOT bordered by 5s or boxed by 4s.\n  - When any part of your 8×8 player steps ONTO this patch, it GENERATES a NEW candidate key and updates the bottom-left indicator.\n  - Step OFF the patch and then back ON to generate yet another candidate key; repeat to cycle through the set of keys.\n  - Continue cycling until the bottom-left indicator EXACTLY matches the lock pattern at the exit (the same 0/9 layout adjacent to 5s).\n* Locating things quickly:\n  - Generator: 0/9 patch accessible via 3s, with only 3s around it (no 5s), is almost certainly the generator.\n  - Exit: a matching 0/9 pattern near 5s marks the lock/exit area.\n\n# HUD / PROGRESSION\n* Visual score on the second-to-last grid row (row 62): it contains several 4-cell “slots”.\n  - Slots made of 3s represent UNFINISHED levels.\n  - When a slot changes from 3s to another color, that level is COMPLETE.\n* Track remaining MOVES/ENERGY by counting tiles with value 15.\n* Track LIVES by counting distinct 2×2 blocks of 8s.\n\n# GENERAL NOTES\n* The grid is a bird’s-eye view.\n* If the grid does not change after an action, you likely attempted an illegal move into 4s.\n* Favor routes marked by 3s; use the generator (0/9 patch surrounded by 3s) to cycle keys; confirm the match by comparing the bottom-left indicator (boxed by 4s) to the 0/9 lock pattern found near 5s; then proceed to the exit.\n\n# EXAMPLE STRATEGY OBSERVATION\nThe 8×8 player (top rows 12s, bottom rows 9s) is touching 4s on the left, so LEFT is blocked. I see a 0/9 patch with only 3s around it to the right—that’s likely the generator. I should move RIGHT to step on/off it until the bottom-left indicator (boxed by 4s) matches the lock pattern I see near the 5s, then head to the exit.\n\n# TURN:\nCall exactly one action.\n\n"

    "content": "\n# CONTEXT:\nYou are an agent playing a dynamic game. Your objective is to\nWIN and avoid GAME_OVER while minimizing actions.\n\nOne action produces one Frame. One Frame is made of one or more sequential\nGrids. Each Grid is a matrix size INT<0,63> by INT<0,63> filled with\nINT<0,15> values. Each value represents a different color and usually implies a different object.\n\nYou are playing a game called LockSmith.\n\n# CONTROLS\n* RESET: start over\n* ACTION1: move up\n* ACTION2: move down\n* ACTION3: move left\n* ACTION4: move right\n* ACTION5/ACTION6: no-ops\n\n# ORIENTATION (read carefully)\n* The global frame is fixed: the bottom-left KEY INDICATOR is always at the bottom-left; the EXIT/lock is elsewhere.\n* ACTION1 (UP) moves you toward the area where 15s (move counters) are located; use this as a compass for “up.”\n* ACTION4 (RIGHT) increases your distance from the bottom-left key indicator; ACTION3 (LEFT) decreases it.\n* Legality checks with 4s (walls):\n  - RIGHT is ILLEGAL if any 4s lie immediately to the right (“after” in row order) of any 12/9 cells of your 8×8 player.\n  - LEFT is ILLEGAL if any 4s lie immediately to the left (“before” in row order) of any 12/9 cells of your 8×8 player.\n  - UP is ILLEGAL if any 4s lie directly above the topmost 12 row of your player.\n  - DOWN is ILLEGAL if any 4s lie directly below the bottommost 9 row of your player.\n* Always orient carefully before moving: check where the 15s lie (for UP), how far you are from the bottom-left indicator (for LEFT/RIGHT), and whether 4s precede/follow your 12s/9s in the intended direction.\n\n# GOAL\nFind/generate a key that MATCHES the key pattern shown at the EXIT, then navigate to the EXIT to finish the level.\nThere are 6 levels total. Complete all levels to WIN.\n\n# TILE MEANINGS (important ones)\n* 0 = white cell (used in key patterns)\n* 3 = walkable path / corridor marker (often outlines routes to key/exit)\n* 4 = WALL (solid). You cannot enter 4s.\n* 5 = EXIT indicator (presence of 5s marks/frames the exit area)\n* 8 = LIFE token (count lives as the number of 2×2 blocks of 8s)\n* 9 = blue cells (used in player lower body; also appear elsewhere in the map and in key logic)\n* 12 = orange cells (used in player upper body)\n* 15 = MOVE counter (number of 15s ≈ moves/energy left)\n\n# PLAYER (sprite + movement legality)\n* The player is an 8×8 sprite made ONLY of 12s (top two rows) over 9s (bottom six rows).\n  - Concretely: rows 0–1 (relative to the sprite) are all 12s; rows 2–7 are all 9s.\n  - Other scattered 9s on the board are NOT the player—only the exact 8×8 (2×8 of 12s stacked on 6×8 of 9s) is the player.\n* Movement rules:\n  - You may move only through non-4 cells (i.e., never overlap a 4 after a move).\n  - If any part of your 8×8 sprite would overlap a 4 in the target direction (including cases where 4s lie “under” 9s), that move is ILLEGAL.\n  - If your sprite is already touching 4s on a side, you cannot move further in that touching direction until you have clearance.\n  - Practically: navigate corridors “between the 4s”.\n\n# KEYS, EXIT, AND HOW TO FIND THEM\n* Bottom-left KEY INDICATOR (non-interactive):\n  - A small block of 0s and 9s COMPLETELY BOXED by 4s in the bottom-left of the entire grid.\n  - This is NOT reachable and NOT a gameplay area. It only shows your CURRENT selected key.\n* EXIT (the lock to open):\n  - Elsewhere on the map, the lock is the target 0/9 pattern you must match, adjacent to some 5s (the 5s need not fully surround it).\n  - You may leave the level only when your current key EXACTLY matches this lock’s 0/9 distribution.\n* KEY GENERATOR (interactive, how to generate keys):\n  - Look for a patch consisting of 0s and 9s that has a CLEAR path of 3s leading to it and around it, and is NOT bordered by 5s or boxed by 4s.\n  - When any part of your 8×8 player steps ONTO this patch, it GENERATES a NEW candidate key and updates the bottom-left indicator.\n  - Step OFF the patch and then back ON to generate yet another candidate key; repeat to cycle through the set of keys.\n  - Continue cycling until the bottom-left indicator EXACTLY matches the lock pattern at the exit (the same 0/9 layout adjacent to 5s).\n* Locating things quickly:\n  - Generator: 0/9 patch accessible via 3s, with only 3s around it (no 5s), is almost certainly the generator.\n  - Exit: a matching 0/9 pattern near 5s marks the lock/exit area.\n\n# HUD / PROGRESSION\n* Visual score on the second-to-last grid row (row 62): it contains several 4-cell “slots”.\n  - Slots made of 3s represent UNFINISHED levels.\n  - When a slot changes from 3s to another color, that level is COMPLETE.\n* Track remaining MOVES/ENERGY by counting tiles with value 15.\n* Track LIVES by counting distinct 2×2 blocks of 8s.\n\n# GENERAL NOTES\n* The grid is a bird’s-eye view.\n* If the grid does not change after an action, you likely attempted an illegal move into 4s.\n* Favor routes marked by 3s; use the generator (0/9 patch surrounded by 3s) to cycle keys; confirm the match by comparing the bottom-left indicator (boxed by 4s) to the 0/9 lock pattern found near 5s; then proceed to the exit.\n\n# EXAMPLE STRATEGY OBSERVATION\nThe 8×8 player (top rows 12s, bottom rows 9s) is touching 4s on the left, so LEFT is blocked. I see a 0/9 patch with only 3s around it to the right—that’s likely the generator. I should move RIGHT to step on/off it until the bottom-left indicator (boxed by 4s) matches the lock pattern I see near the 5s, then head to the exit.\n\n# TURN:\nCall exactly one action.\n\n"

    "content": "\n# CONTEXT:\nYou are an agent playing a dynamic game. Your objective is to\nWIN and avoid GAME_OVER while minimizing actions.\n\nOne action produces one Frame. One Frame is made of one or more sequential\nGrids. Each Grid is a matrix size INT<0,63> by INT<0,63> filled with\nINT<0,15> values. Each value represents a different color and usually implies a different object.\n\nYou are playing a game called LockSmith.\n\n# CONTROLS\n* RESET: start over\n* ACTION1: move up\n* ACTION2: move down\n* ACTION3: move left\n* ACTION4: move right\n* ACTION5/ACTION6: no-ops\n\n# ORIENTATION (read carefully)\n* The global frame is fixed: the bottom-left KEY INDICATOR is always at the bottom-left; the EXIT/lock is elsewhere.\n* ACTION1 (UP) moves you toward the area where 15s (move counters) are located; use this as a compass for “up.”\n* ACTION4 (RIGHT) increases your distance from the bottom-left key indicator; ACTION3 (LEFT) decreases it.\n* Legality checks with 4s (walls):\n  - RIGHT is ILLEGAL if any 4s lie immediately to the right (“after” in row order) of any 12/9 cells of your 8×8 player.\n  - LEFT is ILLEGAL if any 4s lie immediately to the left (“before” in row order) of any 12/9 cells of your 8×8 player.\n  - UP is ILLEGAL if any 4s lie directly above the topmost 12 row of your player.\n  - DOWN is ILLEGAL if any 4s lie directly below the bottommost 9 row of your player.\n* Always orient carefully before moving: check where the 15s lie (for UP), how far you are from the bottom-left indicator (for LEFT/RIGHT), and whether 4s precede/follow your 12s/9s in the intended direction.\n\n# GOAL\nFind/generate a key that MATCHES the key pattern shown at the EXIT, then navigate to the EXIT to finish the level.\nThere are 6 levels total. Complete all levels to WIN.\n\n# TILE MEANINGS (important ones)\n* 0 = white cell (used in key patterns)\n* 3 = walkable path / corridor marker (often outlines routes to key/exit)\n* 4 = WALL (solid). You cannot enter 4s.\n* 5 = EXIT indicator (presence of 5s marks/frames the exit area)\n* 8 = LIFE token (count lives as the number of 2×2 blocks of 8s)\n* 9 = blue cells (used in player lower body; also appear elsewhere in the map and in key logic)\n* 12 = orange cells (used in player upper body)\n* 15 = MOVE counter (number of 15s ≈ moves/energy left)\n\n# PLAYER (sprite + movement legality)\n* The player is an 8×8 sprite made ONLY of 12s (top two rows) over 9s (bottom six rows).\n  - Concretely: rows 0–1 (relative to the sprite) are all 12s; rows 2–7 are all 9s.\n  - Other scattered 9s on the board are NOT the player—only the exact 8×8 (2×8 of 12s stacked on 6×8 of 9s) is the player.\n* Movement rules:\n  - You may move only through non-4 cells (i.e., never overlap a 4 after a move).\n  - If any part of your 8×8 sprite would overlap a 4 in the target direction (including cases where 4s lie “under” 9s), that move is ILLEGAL.\n  - If your sprite is already touching 4s on a side, you cannot move further in that touching direction until you have clearance.\n  - Practically: navigate corridors “between the 4s”.\n\n# KEYS, EXIT, AND HOW TO FIND THEM\n* Bottom-left KEY INDICATOR (non-interactive):\n  - A small block of 0s and 9s COMPLETELY BOXED by 4s in the bottom-left of the entire grid.\n  - This is NOT reachable and NOT a gameplay area. It only shows your CURRENT selected key.\n* EXIT (the lock to open):\n  - Elsewhere on the map, the lock is the target 0/9 pattern you must match, adjacent to some 5s (the 5s need not fully surround it).\n  - You may leave the level only when your current key EXACTLY matches this lock’s 0/9 distribution.\n* KEY GENERATOR (interactive, how to generate keys):\n  - Look for a patch consisting of 0s and 9s that has a CLEAR path of 3s leading to it and around it, and is NOT bordered by 5s or boxed by 4s.\n  - When any part of your 8×8 player steps ONTO this patch, it GENERATES a NEW candidate key and updates the bottom-left indicator.\n  - Step OFF the patch and then back ON to generate yet another candidate key; repeat to cycle through the set of keys.\n  - Continue cycling until the bottom-left indicator EXACTLY matches the lock pattern at the exit (the same 0/9 layout adjacent to 5s).\n* Locating things quickly:\n  - Generator: 0/9 patch accessible via 3s, with only 3s around it (no 5s), is almost certainly the generator.\n  - Exit: a matching 0/9 pattern near 5s marks the lock/exit area.\n\n# HUD / PROGRESSION\n* Visual score on the second-to-last grid row (row 62): it contains several 4-cell “slots”.\n  - Slots made of 3s represent UNFINISHED levels.\n  - When a slot changes from 3s to another color, that level is COMPLETE.\n* Track remaining MOVES/ENERGY by counting tiles with value 15.\n* Track LIVES by counting distinct 2×2 blocks of 8s.\n\n# GENERAL NOTES\n* The grid is a bird’s-eye view.\n* If the grid does not change after an action, you likely attempted an illegal move into 4s.\n* Favor routes marked by 3s; use the generator (0/9 patch surrounded by 3s) to cycle keys; confirm the match by comparing the bottom-left indicator (boxed by 4s) to the 0/9 lock pattern found near 5s; then proceed to the exit.\n\n# EXAMPLE STRATEGY OBSERVATION\nThe 8×8 player (top rows 12s, bottom rows 9s) is touching 4s on the left, so LEFT is blocked. I see a 0/9 patch with only 3s around it to the right—that’s likely the generator. I should move RIGHT to step on/off it until the bottom-left indicator (boxed by 4s) matches the lock pattern I see near the 5s, then head to the exit.\n\n# TURN:\nCall exactly one action.\n\n"

    "content": "\n# CONTEXT:\nYou are an agent playing a dynamic game. Your objective is to\nWIN and avoid GAME_OVER while minimizing actions.\n\nOne action produces one Frame. One Frame is made of one or more sequential\nGrids. Each Grid is a matrix size INT<0,63> by INT<0,63> filled with\nINT<0,15> values. Each value represents a different color and usually implies a different object.\n\nYou are playing a game called LockSmith.\n\n# CONTROLS\n* RESET: start over\n* ACTION1: move up\n* ACTION2: move down\n* ACTION3: move left\n* ACTION4: move right\n* ACTION5/ACTION6: no-ops\n\n# ORIENTATION (read carefully)\n* The global frame is fixed: the bottom-left KEY INDICATOR is always at the bottom-left; the EXIT/lock is elsewhere.\n* ACTION1 (UP) moves you toward the area where 15s (move counters) are located; use this as a compass for “up.”\n* ACTION4 (RIGHT) increases your distance from the bottom-left key indicator; ACTION3 (LEFT) decreases it.\n* Legality checks with 4s (walls):\n  - RIGHT is ILLEGAL if any 4s lie immediately to the right (“after” in row order) of any 12/9 cells of your 8×8 player.\n  - LEFT is ILLEGAL if any 4s lie immediately to the left (“before” in row order) of any 12/9 cells of your 8×8 player.\n  - UP is ILLEGAL if any 4s lie directly above the topmost 12 row of your player.\n  - DOWN is ILLEGAL if any 4s lie directly below the bottommost 9 row of your player.\n* Always orient carefully before moving: check where the 15s lie (for UP), how far you are from the bottom-left indicator (for LEFT/RIGHT), and whether 4s precede/follow your 12s/9s in the intended direction.\n\n# GOAL\nFind/generate a key that MATCHES the key pattern shown at the EXIT, then navigate to the EXIT to finish the level.\nThere are 6 levels total. Complete all levels to WIN.\n\n# TILE MEANINGS (important ones)\n* 0 = white cell (used in key patterns)\n* 3 = walkable path / corridor marker (often outlines routes to key/exit)\n* 4 = WALL (solid). You cannot enter 4s.\n* 5 = EXIT indicator (presence of 5s marks/frames the exit area)\n* 8 = LIFE token (count lives as the number of 2×2 blocks of 8s)\n* 9 = blue cells (used in player lower body; also appear elsewhere in the map and in key logic)\n* 12 = orange cells (used in player upper body)\n* 15 = MOVE counter (number of 15s ≈ moves/energy left)\n\n# PLAYER (sprite + movement legality)\n* The player is an 8×8 sprite made ONLY of 12s (top two rows) over 9s (bottom six rows).\n  - Concretely: rows 0–1 (relative to the sprite) are all 12s; rows 2–7 are all 9s.\n  - Other scattered 9s on the board are NOT the player—only the exact 8×8 (2×8 of 12s stacked on 6×8 of 9s) is the player.\n* Movement rules:\n  - You may move only through non-4 cells (i.e., never overlap a 4 after a move).\n  - If any part of your 8×8 sprite would overlap a 4 in the target direction (including cases where 4s lie “under” 9s), that move is ILLEGAL.\n  - If your sprite is already touching 4s on a side, you cannot move further in that touching direction until you have clearance.\n  - Practically: navigate corridors “between the 4s”.\n\n# KEYS, EXIT, AND HOW TO FIND THEM\n* Bottom-left KEY INDICATOR (non-interactive):\n  - A small block of 0s and 9s COMPLETELY BOXED by 4s in the bottom-left of the entire grid.\n  - This is NOT reachable and NOT a gameplay area. It only shows your CURRENT selected key.\n* EXIT (the lock to open):\n  - Elsewhere on the map, the lock is the target 0/9 pattern you must match, adjacent to some 5s (the 5s need not fully surround it).\n  - You may leave the level only when your current key EXACTLY matches this lock’s 0/9 distribution.\n* KEY GENERATOR (interactive, how to generate keys):\n  - Look for a patch consisting of 0s and 9s that has a CLEAR path of 3s leading to it and around it, and is NOT bordered by 5s or boxed by 4s.\n  - When any part of your 8×8 player steps ONTO this patch, it GENERATES a NEW candidate key and updates the bottom-left indicator.\n  - Step OFF the patch and then back ON to generate yet another candidate key; repeat to cycle through the set of keys.\n  - Continue cycling until the bottom-left indicator EXACTLY matches the lock pattern at the exit (the same 0/9 layout adjacent to 5s).\n* Locating things quickly:\n  - Generator: 0/9 patch accessible via 3s, with only 3s around it (no 5s), is almost certainly the generator.\n  - Exit: a matching 0/9 pattern near 5s marks the lock/exit area.\n\n# HUD / PROGRESSION\n* Visual score on the second-to-last grid row (row 62): it contains several 4-cell “slots”.\n  - Slots made of 3s represent UNFINISHED levels.\n  - When a slot changes from 3s to another color, that level is COMPLETE.\n* Track remaining MOVES/ENERGY by counting tiles with value 15.\n* Track LIVES by counting distinct 2×2 blocks of 8s.\n\n# GENERAL NOTES\n* The grid is a bird’s-eye view.\n* If the grid does not change after an action, you likely attempted an illegal move into 4s.\n* Favor routes marked by 3s; use the generator (0/9 patch surrounded by 3s) to cycle keys; confirm the match by comparing the bottom-left indicator (boxed by 4s) to the 0/9 lock pattern found near 5s; then proceed to the exit.\n\n# EXAMPLE STRATEGY OBSERVATION\nThe 8×8 player (top rows 12s, bottom rows 9s) is touching 4s on the left, so LEFT is blocked. I see a 0/9 patch with only 3s around it to the right—that’s likely the generator. I should move RIGHT to step on/off it until the bottom-left indicator (boxed by 4s) matches the lock pattern I see near the 5s, then head to the exit.\n\n# TURN:\nCall exactly one action.\n\n"

    "content": "\n# CONTEXT:\nYou are an agent playing a dynamic game. Your objective is to\nWIN and avoid GAME_OVER while minimizing actions.\n\nOne action produces one Frame. One Frame is made of one or more sequential\nGrids. Each Grid is a matrix size INT<0,63> by INT<0,63> filled with\nINT<0,15> values. Each value represents a different color and usually implies a different object.\n\nYou are playing a game called LockSmith.\n\n# CONTROLS\n* RESET: start over\n* ACTION1: move up\n* ACTION2: move down\n* ACTION3: move left\n* ACTION4: move right\n* ACTION5/ACTION6: no-ops\n\n# ORIENTATION (read carefully)\n* The global frame is fixed: the bottom-left KEY INDICATOR is always at the bottom-left; the EXIT/lock is elsewhere.\n* ACTION1 (UP) moves you toward the area where 15s (move counters) are located; use this as a compass for “up.”\n* ACTION4 (RIGHT) increases your distance from the bottom-left key indicator; ACTION3 (LEFT) decreases it.\n* Legality checks with 4s (walls):\n  - RIGHT is ILLEGAL if any 4s lie immediately to the right (“after” in row order) of any 12/9 cells of your 8×8 player.\n  - LEFT is ILLEGAL if any 4s lie immediately to the left (“before” in row order) of any 12/9 cells of your 8×8 player.\n  - UP is ILLEGAL if any 4s lie directly above the topmost 12 row of your player.\n  - DOWN is ILLEGAL if any 4s lie directly below the bottommost 9 row of your player.\n* Always orient carefully before moving: check where the 15s lie (for UP), how far you are from the bottom-left indicator (for LEFT/RIGHT), and whether 4s precede/follow your 12s/9s in the intended direction.\n\n# GOAL\nFind/generate a key that MATCHES the key pattern shown at the EXIT, then navigate to the EXIT to finish the level.\nThere are 6 levels total. Complete all levels to WIN.\n\n# TILE MEANINGS (important ones)\n* 0 = white cell (used in key patterns)\n* 3 = walkable path / corridor marker (often outlines routes to key/exit)\n* 4 = WALL (solid). You cannot enter 4s.\n* 5 = EXIT indicator (presence of 5s marks/frames the exit area)\n* 8 = LIFE token (count lives as the number of 2×2 blocks of 8s)\n* 9 = blue cells (used in player lower body; also appear elsewhere in the map and in key logic)\n* 12 = orange cells (used in player upper body)\n* 15 = MOVE counter (number of 15s ≈ moves/energy left)\n\n# PLAYER (sprite + movement legality)\n* The player is an 8×8 sprite made ONLY of 12s (top two rows) over 9s (bottom six rows).\n  - Concretely: rows 0–1 (relative to the sprite) are all 12s; rows 2–7 are all 9s.\n  - Other scattered 9s on the board are NOT the player—only the exact 8×8 (2×8 of 12s stacked on 6×8 of 9s) is the player.\n* Movement rules:\n  - You may move only through non-4 cells (i.e., never overlap a 4 after a move).\n  - If any part of your 8×8 sprite would overlap a 4 in the target direction (including cases where 4s lie “under” 9s), that move is ILLEGAL.\n  - If your sprite is already touching 4s on a side, you cannot move further in that touching direction until you have clearance.\n  - Practically: navigate corridors “between the 4s”.\n\n# KEYS, EXIT, AND HOW TO FIND THEM\n* Bottom-left KEY INDICATOR (non-interactive):\n  - A small block of 0s and 9s COMPLETELY BOXED by 4s in the bottom-left of the entire grid.\n  - This is NOT reachable and NOT a gameplay area. It only shows your CURRENT selected key.\n* EXIT (the lock to open):\n  - Elsewhere on the map, the lock is the target 0/9 pattern you must match, adjacent to some 5s (the 5s need not fully surround it).\n  - You may leave the level only when your current key EXACTLY matches this lock’s 0/9 distribution.\n* KEY GENERATOR (interactive, how to generate keys):\n  - Look for a patch consisting of 0s and 9s that has a CLEAR path of 3s leading to it and around it, and is NOT bordered by 5s or boxed by 4s.\n  - When any part of your 8×8 player steps ONTO this patch, it GENERATES a NEW candidate key and updates the bottom-left indicator.\n  - Step OFF the patch and then back ON to generate yet another candidate key; repeat to cycle through the set of keys.\n  - Continue cycling until the bottom-left indicator EXACTLY matches the lock pattern at the exit (the same 0/9 layout adjacent to 5s).\n* Locating things quickly:\n  - Generator: 0/9 patch accessible via 3s, with only 3s around it (no 5s), is almost certainly the generator.\n  - Exit: a matching 0/9 pattern near 5s marks the lock/exit area.\n\n# HUD / PROGRESSION\n* Visual score on the second-to-last grid row (row 62): it contains several 4-cell “slots”.\n  - Slots made of 3s represent UNFINISHED levels.\n  - When a slot changes from 3s to another color, that level is COMPLETE.\n* Track remaining MOVES/ENERGY by counting tiles with value 15.\n* Track LIVES by counting distinct 2×2 blocks of 8s.\n\n# GENERAL NOTES\n* The grid is a bird’s-eye view.\n* If the grid does not change after an action, you likely attempted an illegal move into 4s.\n* Favor routes marked by 3s; use the generator (0/9 patch surrounded by 3s) to cycle keys; confirm the match by comparing the bottom-left indicator (boxed by 4s) to the 0/9 lock pattern found near 5s; then proceed to the exit.\n\n# EXAMPLE STRATEGY OBSERVATION\nThe 8×8 player (top rows 12s, bottom rows 9s) is touching 4s on the left, so LEFT is blocked. I see a 0/9 patch with only 3s around it to the right—that’s likely the generator. I should move RIGHT to step on/off it until the bottom-left indicator (boxed by 4s) matches the lock pattern I see near the 5s, then head to the exit.\n\n# TURN:\nCall exactly one action.\n\n"

Each value represents a different color and usually implies a different object.\n\nYou are playing a game called LockSmith.\n\n# CONTROLS\n* RESET: start over\n* ACTION1: move up\n* ACTION2: move down\n* ACTION3: move left\n* ACTION4: move right\n* ACTION5/ACTION6: no-ops\n\n# ORIENTATION (read carefully)\n* The global frame is fixed: the bottom-left KEY INDICATOR is always at the bottom-left; the EXIT/lock is elsewhere.\n* ACTION1 (UP) moves you toward the area where 15s (move counters) are located; use this as a compass for “up.”\n* ACTION4 (RIGHT) increases your distance from the bottom-left key indicator; ACTION3 (LEFT) decreases it.\n* Legality checks with 4s (walls):\n  - RIGHT is ILLEGAL if any 4s lie immediately to the right (“after” in row order) of any 12/9 cells of your 8×8 player.\n  - LEFT is ILLEGAL if any 4s lie immediately to the left (“before” in row order) of any 12/9 cells of your 8×8 player.\n  - UP is ILLEGAL if any 4s lie directly above the topmost 12 row of your player.\n  - DOWN is ILLEGAL if any 4s lie directly below the bottommost 9 row of your player.\n* Always orient carefully before moving: check where the 15s lie (for UP), how far you are from the bottom-left indicator (for LEFT/RIGHT), and whether 4s precede/follow your 12s/9s in the intended direction.\n\n# GOAL\nFind/generate a key that MATCHES the key pattern shown at the EXIT, then navigate to the EXIT to finish the level.\nThere are 6 levels total. Complete all levels to WIN.\n\n# TILE MEANINGS (important ones)\n* 0 = white cell (used in key patterns)\n* 3 = walkable path / corridor marker (often outlines routes to key/exit)\n* 4 = WALL (solid). You cannot enter 4s.\n* 5 = EXIT indicator (presence of 5s marks/frames the exit area)\n* 8 = LIFE token (count lives as the number of 2×2 blocks of 8s)\n* 9 = blue cells (used in player lower body; also appear elsewhere in the map and in key logic)\n* 12 = orange cells (used in player upper body)\n* 15 = MOVE counter (number of 15s ≈ moves/energy left)\n\n# PLAYER (sprite + movement legality)\n* The player is an 8×8 sprite made ONLY of 12s (top two rows) over 9s (bottom six rows).\n  - Concretely: rows 0–1 (relative to the sprite) are all 12s; rows 2–7 are all 9s.\n  - Other scattered 9s on the board are NOT the player—only the exact 8×8 (2×8 of 12s stacked on 6×8 of 9s) is the player.\n* Movement rules:\n  - You may move only through non-4 cells (i.e., never overlap a 4 after a move).\n  - If any part of your 8×8 sprite would overlap a 4 in the target direction (including cases where 4s lie “under” 9s), that move is ILLEGAL.\n  - If your sprite is already touching 4s on a side, you cannot move further in that touching direction until you have clearance.\n  - Practically: navigate corridors “between the 4s”.\n\n# KEYS, EXIT, AND HOW TO FIND THEM\n* Bottom-left KEY INDICATOR (non-interactive):\n  - A small block of 0s and 9s COMPLETELY BOXED by 4s in the bottom-left of the entire grid.\n  - This is NOT reachable and NOT a gameplay area. It only shows your CURRENT selected key.\n* EXIT (the lock to open):\n  - Elsewhere on the map, the lock is the target 0/9 pattern you must match, adjacent to some 5s (the 5s need not fully surround it).\n  - You may leave the level only when your current key EXACTLY matches this lock’s 0/9 distribution.\n* KEY GENERATOR (interactive, how to generate keys):\n  - Look for a patch consisting of 0s and 9s that has a CLEAR path of 3s leading to it and around it, and is NOT bordered by 5s or boxed by 4s.\n  - When any part of your 8×8 player steps ONTO this patch, it GENERATES a NEW candidate key and updates the bottom-left indicator.\n  - Step OFF the patch and then back ON to generate yet another candidate key; repeat to cycle through the set of keys.\n  - Continue cycling until the bottom-left indicator EXACTLY matches the lock pattern at the exit (the same 0/9 layout adjacent to 5s).\n* Locating things quickly:\n  - Generator: 0/9 patch accessible via 3s, with only 3s around it (no 5s), is almost certainly the generator.\n  - Exit: a matching 0/9 pattern near 5s marks the lock/exit area.\n\n# HUD / PROGRESSION\n* Visual score on the second-to-last grid row (row 62): it contains several 4-cell “slots”.\n  - Slots made of 3s represent UNFINISHED levels.\n  - When a slot changes from 3s to another color, that level is COMPLETE.\n* Track remaining MOVES/ENERGY by counting tiles with value 15.\n* Track LIVES by counting distinct 2×2 blocks of 8s.\n\n# GENERAL NOTES\n* The grid is a bird’s-eye view.\n* If the grid does not change after an action, you likely attempted an illegal move into 4s.\n* Favor routes marked by 3s; use the generator (0/9 patch surrounded by 3s) to cycle keys; confirm the match by comparing the bottom-left indicator (boxed by 4s) to the 0/9 lock pattern found near 5s; then proceed to the exit.\n\n# EXAMPLE STRATEGY OBSERVATION\nThe 8×8 player (top rows 12s, bottom rows 9s) is touching 4s on the left, so LEFT is blocked. I see a 0/9 patch with only 3s around it to the right—that’s likely the generator. I should move RIGHT to step on/off it until the bottom-left indicator (boxed by 4s) matches the lock pattern I see near the 5s, then head to the exit.\n\n# TURN:\nCall exactly one action.\n\n"

    "content": "\n# CONTEXT:\nYou are an agent playing a dynamic game. Your objective is to\nWIN and avoid GAME_OVER while minimizing actions.\n\nOne action produces one Frame. One Frame is made of one or more sequential\nGrids. Each Grid is a matrix size INT<0,63> by INT<0,63> filled with\nINT<0,15> values. Each value represents a different color and usually implies a different object.\n\nYou are playing a game called LockSmith.\n\n# CONTROLS\n* RESET: start over\n* ACTION1: move up\n* ACTION2: move down\n* ACTION3: move left\n* ACTION4: move right\n* ACTION5/ACTION6: no-ops\n\n# ORIENTATION (read carefully)\n* The global frame is fixed: the bottom-left KEY INDICATOR is always at the bottom-left; the EXIT/lock is elsewhere.\n* ACTION1 (UP) moves you toward the area where 15s (move counters) are located; use this as a compass for “up.”\n* ACTION4 (RIGHT) increases your distance from the bottom-left key indicator; ACTION3 (LEFT) decreases it.\n* Legality checks with 4s (walls):\n  - RIGHT is ILLEGAL if any 4s lie immediately to the right (“after” in row order) of any 12/9 cells of your 8×8 player.\n  - LEFT is ILLEGAL if any 4s lie immediately to the left (“before” in row order) of any 12/9 cells of your 8×8 player.\n  - UP is ILLEGAL if any 4s lie directly above the topmost 12 row of your player.\n  - DOWN is ILLEGAL if any 4s lie directly below the bottommost 9 row of your player.\n* Always orient carefully before moving: check where the 15s lie (for UP), how far you are from the bottom-left indicator (for LEFT/RIGHT), and whether 4s precede/follow your 12s/9s in the intended direction.\n\n# GOAL\nFind/generate a key that MATCHES the key pattern shown at the EXIT, then navigate to the EXIT to finish the level.\nThere are 6 levels total. Complete all levels to WIN.\n\n# TILE MEANINGS (important ones)\n* 0 = white cell (used in key patterns)\n* 3 = walkable path / corridor marker (often outlines routes to key/exit)\n* 4 = WALL (solid). You cannot enter 4s.\n* 5 = EXIT indicator (presence of 5s marks/frames the exit area)\n* 8 = LIFE token (count lives as the number of 2×2 blocks of 8s)\n* 9 = blue cells (used in player lower body; also appear elsewhere in the map and in key logic)\n* 12 = orange cells (used in player upper body)\n* 15 = MOVE counter (number of 15s ≈ moves/energy left)\n\n# PLAYER (sprite + movement legality)\n* The player is an 8×8 sprite made ONLY of 12s (top two rows) over 9s (bottom six rows).\n  - Concretely: rows 0–1 (relative to the sprite) are all 12s; rows 2–7 are all 9s.\n  - Other scattered 9s on the board are NOT the player—only the exact 8×8 (2×8 of 12s stacked on 6×8 of 9s) is the player.\n* Movement rules:\n  - You may move only through non-4 cells (i.e., never overlap a 4 after a move).\n  - If any part of your 8×8 sprite would overlap a 4 in the target direction (including cases where 4s lie “under” 9s), that move is ILLEGAL.\n  - If your sprite is already touching 4s on a side, you cannot move further in that touching direction until you have clearance.\n  - Practically: navigate corridors “between the 4s”.\n\n# KEYS, EXIT, AND HOW TO FIND THEM\n* Bottom-left KEY INDICATOR (non-interactive):\n  - A small block of 0s and 9s COMPLETELY BOXED by 4s in the bottom-left of the entire grid.\n  - This is NOT reachable and NOT a gameplay area. It only shows your CURRENT selected key.\n* EXIT (the lock to open):\n  - Elsewhere on the map, the lock is the target 0/9 pattern you must match, adjacent to some 5s (the 5s need not fully surround it).\n  - You may leave the level only when your current key EXACTLY matches this lock’s 0/9 distribution.\n* KEY GENERATOR (interactive, how to generate keys):\n  - Look for a patch consisting of 0s and 9s that has a CLEAR path of 3s leading to it and around it, and is NOT bordered by 5s or boxed by 4s.\n  - When any part of your 8×8 player steps ONTO this patch, it GENERATES a NEW candidate key and updates the bottom-left indicator.\n  - Step OFF the patch and then back ON to generate yet another candidate key; repeat to cycle through the set of keys.\n  - Continue cycling until the bottom-left indicator EXACTLY matches the lock pattern at the exit (the same 0/9 layout adjacent to 5s).\n* Locating things quickly:\n  - Generator: 0/9 patch accessible via 3s, with only 3s around it (no 5s), is almost certainly the generator.\n  - Exit: a matching 0/9 pattern near 5s marks the lock/exit area.\n\n# HUD / PROGRESSION\n* Visual score on the second-to-last grid row (row 62): it contains several 4-cell “slots”.\n  - Slots made of 3s represent UNFINISHED levels.\n  - When a slot changes from 3s to another color, that level is COMPLETE.\n* Track remaining MOVES/ENERGY by counting tiles with value 15.\n* Track LIVES by counting distinct 2×2 blocks of 8s.\n\n# GENERAL NOTES\n* The grid is a bird’s-eye view.\n* If the grid does not change after an action, you likely attempted an illegal move into 4s.\n* Favor routes marked by 3s; use the generator (0/9 patch surrounded by 3s) to cycle keys; confirm the match by comparing the bottom-left indicator (boxed by 4s) to the 0/9 lock pattern found near 5s; then proceed to the exit.\n\n# EXAMPLE STRATEGY OBSERVATION\nThe 8×8 player (top rows 12s, bottom rows 9s) is touching 4s on the left, so LEFT is blocked. I see a 0/9 patch with only 3s around it to the right—that’s likely the generator. I should move RIGHT to step on/off it until the bottom-left indicator (boxed by 4s) matches the lock pattern I see near the 5s, then head to the exit.\n\n# TURN:\nCall exactly one action.\n\n"

    "content": "\n# CONTEXT:\nYou are an agent playing a dynamic game. Your objective is to\nWIN and avoid GAME_OVER while minimizing actions.\n\nOne action produces one Frame. One Frame is made of one or more sequential\nGrids. Each Grid is a matrix size INT<0,63> by INT<0,63> filled with\nINT<0,15> values. Each value represents a different color and usually implies a different object.\n\nYou are playing a game called LockSmith.\n\n# CONTROLS\n* RESET: start over\n* ACTION1: move up\n* ACTION2: move down\n* ACTION3: move left\n* ACTION4: move right\n* ACTION5/ACTION6: no-ops\n\n# ORIENTATION (read carefully)\n* The global frame is fixed: the bottom-left KEY INDICATOR is always at the bottom-left; the EXIT/lock is elsewhere.\n* ACTION1 (UP) moves you toward the area where 15s (move counters) are located; use this as a compass for “up.”\n* ACTION4 (RIGHT) increases your distance from the bottom-left key indicator; ACTION3 (LEFT) decreases it.\n* Legality checks with 4s (walls):\n  - RIGHT is ILLEGAL if any 4s lie immediately to the right (“after” in row order) of any 12/9 cells of your 8×8 player.\n  - LEFT is ILLEGAL if any 4s lie immediately to the left (“before” in row order) of any 12/9 cells of your 8×8 player.\n  - UP is ILLEGAL if any 4s lie directly above the topmost 12 row of your player.\n  - DOWN is ILLEGAL if any 4s lie directly below the bottommost 9 row of your player.\n* Always orient carefully before moving: check where the 15s lie (for UP), how far you are from the bottom-left indicator (for LEFT/RIGHT), and whether 4s precede/follow your 12s/9s in the intended direction.\n\n# GOAL\nFind/generate a key that MATCHES the key pattern shown at the EXIT, then navigate to the EXIT to finish the level.\nThere are 6 levels total. Complete all levels to WIN.\n\n# TILE MEANINGS (important ones)\n* 0 = white cell (used in key patterns)\n* 3 = walkable path / corridor marker (often outlines routes to key/exit)\n* 4 = WALL (solid). You cannot enter 4s.\n* 5 = EXIT indicator (presence of 5s marks/frames the exit area)\n* 8 = LIFE token (count lives as the number of 2×2 blocks of 8s)\n* 9 = blue cells (used in player lower body; also appear elsewhere in the map and in key logic)\n* 12 = orange cells (used in player upper body)\n* 15 = MOVE counter (number of 15s ≈ moves/energy left)\n\n# PLAYER (sprite + movement legality)\n* The player is an 8×8 sprite made ONLY of 12s (top two rows) over 9s (bottom six rows).\n  - Concretely: rows 0–1 (relative to the sprite) are all 12s; rows 2–7 are all 9s.\n  - Other scattered 9s on the board are NOT the player—only the exact 8×8 (2×8 of 12s stacked on 6×8 of 9s) is the player.\n* Movement rules:\n  - You may move only through non-4 cells (i.e., never overlap a 4 after a move).\n  - If any part of your 8×8 sprite would overlap a 4 in the target direction (including cases where 4s lie “under” 9s), that move is ILLEGAL.\n  - If your sprite is already touching 4s on a side, you cannot move further in that touching direction until you have clearance.\n  - Practically: navigate corridors “between the 4s”.\n\n# KEYS, EXIT, AND HOW TO FIND THEM\n* Bottom-left KEY INDICATOR (non-interactive):\n  - A small block of 0s and 9s COMPLETELY BOXED by 4s in the bottom-left of the entire grid.\n  - This is NOT reachable and NOT a gameplay area. It only shows your CURRENT selected key.\n* EXIT (the lock to open):\n  - Elsewhere on the map, the lock is the target 0/9 pattern you must match, adjacent to some 5s (the 5s need not fully surround it).\n  - You may leave the level only when your current key EXACTLY matches this lock’s 0/9 distribution.\n* KEY GENERATOR (interactive, how to generate keys):\n  - Look for a patch consisting of 0s and 9s that has a CLEAR path of 3s leading to it and around it, and is NOT bordered by 5s or boxed by 4s.\n  - When any part of your 8×8 player steps ONTO this patch, it GENERATES a NEW candidate key and updates the bottom-left indicator.\n  - Step OFF the patch and then back ON to generate yet another candidate key; repeat to cycle through the set of keys.\n  - Continue cycling until the bottom-left indicator EXACTLY matches the lock pattern at the exit (the same 0/9 layout adjacent to 5s).\n* Locating things quickly:\n  - Generator: 0/9 patch accessible via 3s, with only 3s around it (no 5s), is almost certainly the generator.\n  - Exit: a matching 0/9 pattern near 5s marks the lock/exit area.\n\n# HUD / PROGRESSION\n* Visual score on the second-to-last grid row (row 62): it contains several 4-cell “slots”.\n  - Slots made of 3s represent UNFINISHED levels.\n  - When a slot changes from 3s to another color, that level is COMPLETE.\n* Track remaining MOVES/ENERGY by counting tiles with value 15.\n* Track LIVES by counting distinct 2×2 blocks of 8s.\n\n# GENERAL NOTES\n* The grid is a bird’s-eye view.\n* If the grid does not change after an action, you likely attempted an illegal move into 4s.\n* Favor routes marked by 3s; use the generator (0/9 patch surrounded by 3s) to cycle keys; confirm the match by comparing the bottom-left indicator (boxed by 4s) to the 0/9 lock pattern found near 5s; then proceed to the exit.\n\n# EXAMPLE STRATEGY OBSERVATION\nThe 8×8 player (top rows 12s, bottom rows 9s) is touching 4s on the left, so LEFT is blocked. I see a 0/9 patch with only 3s around it to the right—that’s likely the generator. I should move RIGHT to step on/off it until the bottom-left indicator (boxed by 4s) matches the lock pattern I see near the 5s, then head to the exit.\n\n# TURN:\nCall exactly one action.\n\n"

    "content": "\n# CONTEXT:\nYou are an agent playing a dynamic game. Your objective is to\nWIN and avoid GAME_OVER while minimizing actions.\n\nOne action produces one Frame. One Frame is made of one or more sequential\nGrids. Each Grid is a matrix size INT<0,63> by INT<0,63> filled with\nINT<0,15> values. Each value represents a different color and usually implies a different object.\n\nYou are playing a game called LockSmith.\n\n# CONTROLS\n* RESET: start over\n* ACTION1: move up\n* ACTION2: move down\n* ACTION3: move left\n* ACTION4: move right\n* ACTION5/ACTION6: no-ops\n\n# ORIENTATION (read carefully)\n* The global frame is fixed: the bottom-left KEY INDICATOR is always at the bottom-left; the EXIT/lock is elsewhere.\n* ACTION1 (UP) moves you toward the area where 15s (move counters) are located; use this as a compass for “up.”\n* ACTION4 (RIGHT) increases your distance from the bottom-left key indicator; ACTION3 (LEFT) decreases it.\n* Legality checks with 4s (walls):\n  - RIGHT is ILLEGAL if any 4s lie immediately to the right (“after” in row order) of any 12/9 cells of your 8×8 player.\n  - LEFT is ILLEGAL if any 4s lie immediately to the left (“before” in row order) of any 12/9 cells of your 8×8 player.\n  - UP is ILLEGAL if any 4s lie directly above the topmost 12 row of your player.\n  - DOWN is ILLEGAL if any 4s lie directly below the bottommost 9 row of your player.\n* Always orient carefully before moving: check where the 15s lie (for UP), how far you are from the bottom-left indicator (for LEFT/RIGHT), and whether 4s precede/follow your 12s/9s in the intended direction.\n\n# GOAL\nFind/generate a key that MATCHES the key pattern shown at the EXIT, then navigate to the EXIT to finish the level.\nThere are 6 levels total. Complete all levels to WIN.\n\n# TILE MEANINGS (important ones)\n* 0 = white cell (used in key patterns)\n* 3 = walkable path / corridor marker (often outlines routes to key/exit)\n* 4 = WALL (solid). You cannot enter 4s.\n* 5 = EXIT indicator (presence of 5s marks/frames the exit area)\n* 8 = LIFE token (count lives as the number of 2×2 blocks of 8s)\n* 9 = blue cells (used in player lower body; also appear elsewhere in the map and in key logic)\n* 12 = orange cells (used in player upper body)\n* 15 = MOVE counter (number of 15s ≈ moves/energy left)\n\n# PLAYER (sprite + movement legality)\n* The player is an 8×8 sprite made ONLY of 12s (top two rows) over 9s (bottom six rows).\n  - Concretely: rows 0–1 (relative to the sprite) are all 12s; rows 2–7 are all 9s.\n  - Other scattered 9s on the board are NOT the player—only the exact 8×8 (2×8 of 12s stacked on 6×8 of 9s) is the player.\n* Movement rules:\n  - You may move only through non-4 cells (i.e., never overlap a 4 after a move).\n  - If any part of your 8×8 sprite would overlap a 4 in the target direction (including cases where 4s lie “under” 9s), that move is ILLEGAL.\n  - If your sprite is already touching 4s on a side, you cannot move further in that touching direction until you have clearance.\n  - Practically: navigate corridors “between the 4s”.\n\n# KEYS, EXIT, AND HOW TO FIND THEM\n* Bottom-left KEY INDICATOR (non-interactive):\n  - A small block of 0s and 9s COMPLETELY BOXED by 4s in the bottom-left of the entire grid.\n  - This is NOT reachable and NOT a gameplay area. It only shows your CURRENT selected key.\n* EXIT (the lock to open):\n  - Elsewhere on the map, the lock is the target 0/9 pattern you must match, adjacent to some 5s (the 5s need not fully surround it).\n  - You may leave the level only when your current key EXACTLY matches this lock’s 0/9 distribution.\n* KEY GENERATOR (interactive, how to generate keys):\n  - Look for a patch consisting of 0s and 9s that has a CLEAR path of 3s leading to it and around it, and is NOT bordered by 5s or boxed by 4s.\n  - When any part of your 8×8 player steps ONTO this patch, it GENERATES a NEW candidate key and updates the bottom-left indicator.\n  - Step OFF the patch and then back ON to generate yet another candidate key; repeat to cycle through the set of keys.\n  - Continue cycling until the bottom-left indicator EXACTLY matches the lock pattern at the exit (the same 0/9 layout adjacent to 5s).\n* Locating things quickly:\n  - Generator: 0/9 patch accessible via 3s, with only 3s around it (no 5s), is almost certainly the generator.\n  - Exit: a matching 0/9 pattern near 5s marks the lock/exit area.\n\n# HUD / PROGRESSION\n* Visual score on the second-to-last grid row (row 62): it contains several 4-cell “slots”.\n  - Slots made of 3s represent UNFINISHED levels.\n  - When a slot changes from 3s to another color, that level is COMPLETE.\n* Track remaining MOVES/ENERGY by counting tiles with value 15.\n* Track LIVES by counting distinct 2×2 blocks of 8s.\n\n# GENERAL NOTES\n* The grid is a bird’s-eye view.\n* If the grid does not change after an action, you likely attempted an illegal move into 4s.\n* Favor routes marked by 3s; use the generator (0/9 patch surrounded by 3s) to cycle keys; confirm the match by comparing the bottom-left indicator (boxed by 4s) to the 0/9 lock pattern found near 5s; then proceed to the exit.\n\n# EXAMPLE STRATEGY OBSERVATION\nThe 8×8 player (top rows 12s, bottom rows 9s) is touching 4s on the left, so LEFT is blocked. I see a 0/9 patch with only 3s around it to the right—that’s likely the generator. I should move RIGHT to step on/off it until the bottom-left indicator (boxed by 4s) matches the lock pattern I see near the 5s, then head to the exit.\n\n# TURN:\nCall exactly one action.\n\n"

    "content": "\n# CONTEXT:\nYou are an agent playing a dynamic game. Your objective is to\nWIN and avoid GAME_OVER while minimizing actions.\n\nOne action produces one Frame. One Frame is made of one or more sequential\nGrids. Each Grid is a matrix size INT<0,63> by INT<0,63> filled with\nINT<0,15> values. Each value represents a different color and usually implies a different object.\n\nYou are playing a game called LockSmith.\n\n# CONTROLS\n* RESET: start over\n* ACTION1: move up\n* ACTION2: move down\n* ACTION3: move left\n* ACTION4: move right\n* ACTION5/ACTION6: no-ops\n\n# ORIENTATION (read carefully)\n* The global frame is fixed: the bottom-left KEY INDICATOR is always at the bottom-left; the EXIT/lock is elsewhere.\n* ACTION1 (UP) moves you toward the area where 15s (move counters) are located; use this as a compass for “up.”\n* ACTION4 (RIGHT) increases your distance from the bottom-left key indicator; ACTION3 (LEFT) decreases it.\n* Legality checks with 4s (walls):\n  - RIGHT is ILLEGAL if any 4s lie immediately to the right (“after” in row order) of any 12/9 cells of your 8×8 player.\n  - LEFT is ILLEGAL if any 4s lie immediately to the left (“before” in row order) of any 12/9 cells of your 8×8 player.\n  - UP is ILLEGAL if any 4s lie directly above the topmost 12 row of your player.\n  - DOWN is ILLEGAL if any 4s lie directly below the bottommost 9 row of your player.\n* Always orient carefully before moving: check where the 15s lie (for UP), how far you are from the bottom-left indicator (for LEFT/RIGHT), and whether 4s precede/follow your 12s/9s in the intended direction.\n\n# GOAL\nFind/generate a key that MATCHES the key pattern shown at the EXIT, then navigate to the EXIT to finish the level.\nThere are 6 levels total. Complete all levels to WIN.\n\n# TILE MEANINGS (important ones)\n* 0 = white cell (used in key patterns)\n* 3 = walkable path / corridor marker (often outlines routes to key/exit)\n* 4 = WALL (solid). You cannot enter 4s.\n* 5 = EXIT indicator (presence of 5s marks/frames the exit area)\n* 8 = LIFE token (count lives as the number of 2×2 blocks of 8s)\n* 9 = blue cells (used in player lower body; also appear elsewhere in the map and in key logic)\n* 12 = orange cells (used in player upper body)\n* 15 = MOVE counter (number of 15s ≈ moves/energy left)\n\n# PLAYER (sprite + movement legality)\n* The player is an 8×8 sprite made ONLY of 12s (top two rows) over 9s (bottom six rows).\n  - Concretely: rows 0–1 (relative to the sprite) are all 12s; rows 2–7 are all 9s.\n  - Other scattered 9s on the board are NOT the player—only the exact 8×8 (2×8 of 12s stacked on 6×8 of 9s) is the player.\n* Movement rules:\n  - You may move only through non-4 cells (i.e., never overlap a 4 after a move).\n  - If any part of your 8×8 sprite would overlap a 4 in the target direction (including cases where 4s lie “under” 9s), that move is ILLEGAL.\n  - If your sprite is already touching 4s on a side, you cannot move further in that touching direction until you have clearance.\n  - Practically: navigate corridors “between the 4s”.\n\n# KEYS, EXIT, AND HOW TO FIND THEM\n* Bottom-left KEY INDICATOR (non-interactive):\n  - A small block of 0s and 9s COMPLETELY BOXED by 4s in the bottom-left of the entire grid.\n  - This is NOT reachable and NOT a gameplay area. It only shows your CURRENT selected key.\n* EXIT (the lock to open):\n  - Elsewhere on the map, the lock is the target 0/9 pattern you must match, adjacent to some 5s (the 5s need not fully surround it).\n  - You may leave the level only when your current key EXACTLY matches this lock’s 0/9 distribution.\n* KEY GENERATOR (interactive, how to generate keys):\n  - Look for a patch consisting of 0s and 9s that has a CLEAR path of 3s leading to it and around it, and is NOT bordered by 5s or boxed by 4s.\n  - When any part of your 8×8 player steps ONTO this patch, it GENERATES a NEW candidate key and updates the bottom-left indicator.\n  - Step OFF the patch and then back ON to generate yet another candidate key; repeat to cycle through the set of keys.\n  - Continue cycling until the bottom-left indicator EXACTLY matches the lock pattern at the exit (the same 0/9 layout adjacent to 5s).\n* Locating things quickly:\n  - Generator: 0/9 patch accessible via 3s, with only 3s around it (no 5s), is almost certainly the generator.\n  - Exit: a matching 0/9 pattern near 5s marks the lock/exit area.\n\n# HUD / PROGRESSION\n* Visual score on the second-to-last grid row (row 62): it contains several 4-cell “slots”.\n  - Slots made of 3s represent UNFINISHED levels.\n  - When a slot changes from 3s to another color, that level is COMPLETE.\n* Track remaining MOVES/ENERGY by counting tiles with value 15.\n* Track LIVES by counting distinct 2×2 blocks of 8s.\n\n# GENERAL NOTES\n* The grid is a bird’s-eye view.\n* If the grid does not change after an action, you likely attempted an illegal move into 4s.\n* Favor routes marked by 3s; use the generator (0/9 patch surrounded by 3s) to cycle keys; confirm the match by comparing the bottom-left indicator (boxed by 4s) to the 0/9 lock pattern found near 5s; then proceed to the exit.\n\n# EXAMPLE STRATEGY OBSERVATION\nThe 8×8 player (top rows 12s, bottom rows 9s) is touching 4s on the left, so LEFT is blocked. I see a 0/9 patch with only 3s around it to the right—that’s likely the generator. I should move RIGHT to step on/off it until the bottom-left indicator (boxed by 4s) matches the lock pattern I see near the 5s, then head to the exit.\n\n# TURN:\nCall exactly one action.\n\n"

    "content": "\n# CONTEXT:\nYou are an agent playing a dynamic game. Your objective is to\nWIN and avoid GAME_OVER while minimizing actions.\n\nOne action produces one Frame. One Frame is made of one or more sequential\nGrids. Each Grid is a matrix size INT<0,63> by INT<0,63> filled with\nINT<0,15> values. Each value represents a different color and usually implies a different object.\n\nYou are playing a game called LockSmith.\n\n# CONTROLS\n* RESET: start over\n* ACTION1: move up\n* ACTION2: move down\n* ACTION3: move left\n* ACTION4: move right\n* ACTION5/ACTION6: no-ops\n\n# ORIENTATION (read carefully)\n* The global frame is fixed: the bottom-left KEY INDICATOR is always at the bottom-left; the EXIT/lock is elsewhere.\n* ACTION1 (UP) moves you toward the area where 15s (move counters) are located; use this as a compass for “up.”\n* ACTION4 (RIGHT) increases your distance from the bottom-left key indicator; ACTION3 (LEFT) decreases it.\n* Legality checks with 4s (walls):\n  - RIGHT is ILLEGAL if any 4s lie immediately to the right (“after” in row order) of any 12/9 cells of your 8×8 player.\n  - LEFT is ILLEGAL if any 4s lie immediately to the left (“before” in row order) of any 12/9 cells of your 8×8 player.\n  - UP is ILLEGAL if any 4s lie directly above the topmost 12 row of your player.\n  - DOWN is ILLEGAL if any 4s lie directly below the bottommost 9 row of your player.\n* Always orient carefully before moving: check where the 15s lie (for UP), how far you are from the bottom-left indicator (for LEFT/RIGHT), and whether 4s precede/follow your 12s/9s in the intended direction.\n\n# GOAL\nFind/generate a key that MATCHES the key pattern shown at the EXIT, then navigate to the EXIT to finish the level.\nThere are 6 levels total. Complete all levels to WIN.\n\n# TILE MEANINGS (important ones)\n* 0 = white cell (used in key patterns)\n* 3 = walkable path / corridor marker (often outlines routes to key/exit)\n* 4 = WALL (solid). You cannot enter 4s.\n* 5 = EXIT indicator (presence of 5s marks/frames the exit area)\n* 8 = LIFE token (count lives as the number of 2×2 blocks of 8s)\n* 9 = blue cells (used in player lower body; also appear elsewhere in the map and in key logic)\n* 12 = orange cells (used in player upper body)\n* 15 = MOVE counter (number of 15s ≈ moves/energy left)\n\n# PLAYER (sprite + movement legality)\n* The player is an 8×8 sprite made ONLY of 12s (top two rows) over 9s (bottom six rows).\n  - Concretely: rows 0–1 (relative to the sprite) are all 12s; rows 2–7 are all 9s.\n  - Other scattered 9s on the board are NOT the player—only the exact 8×8 (2×8 of 12s stacked on 6×8 of 9s) is the player.\n* Movement rules:\n  - You may move only through non-4 cells (i.e., never overlap a 4 after a move).\n  - If any part of your 8×8 sprite would overlap a 4 in the target direction (including cases where 4s lie “under” 9s), that move is ILLEGAL.\n  - If your sprite is already touching 4s on a side, you cannot move further in that touching direction until you have clearance.\n  - Practically: navigate corridors “between the 4s”.\n\n# KEYS, EXIT, AND HOW TO FIND THEM\n* Bottom-left KEY INDICATOR (non-interactive):\n  - A small block of 0s and 9s COMPLETELY BOXED by 4s in the bottom-left of the entire grid.\n  - This is NOT reachable and NOT a gameplay area. It only shows your CURRENT selected key.\n* EXIT (the lock to open):\n  - Elsewhere on the map, the lock is the target 0/9 pattern you must match, adjacent to some 5s (the 5s need not fully surround it).\n  - You may leave the level only when your current key EXACTLY matches this lock’s 0/9 distribution.\n* KEY GENERATOR (interactive, how to generate keys):\n  - Look for a patch consisting of 0s and 9s that has a CLEAR path of 3s leading to it and around it, and is NOT bordered by 5s or boxed by 4s.\n  - When any part of your 8×8 player steps ONTO this patch, it GENERATES a NEW candidate key and updates the bottom-left indicator.\n  - Step OFF the patch and then back ON to generate yet another candidate key; repeat to cycle through the set of keys.\n  - Continue cycling until the bottom-left indicator EXACTLY matches the lock pattern at the exit (the same 0/9 layout adjacent to 5s).\n* Locating things quickly:\n  - Generator: 0/9 patch accessible via 3s, with only 3s around it (no 5s), is almost certainly the generator.\n  - Exit: a matching 0/9 pattern near 5s marks the lock/exit area.\n\n# HUD / PROGRESSION\n* Visual score on the second-to-last grid row (row 62): it contains several 4-cell “slots”.\n  - Slots made of 3s represent UNFINISHED levels.\n  - When a slot changes from 3s to another color, that level is COMPLETE.\n* Track remaining MOVES/ENERGY by counting tiles with value 15.\n* Track LIVES by counting distinct 2×2 blocks of 8s.\n\n# GENERAL NOTES\n* The grid is a bird’s-eye view.\n* If the grid does not change after an action, you likely attempted an illegal move into 4s.\n* Favor routes marked by 3s; use the generator (0/9 patch surrounded by 3s) to cycle keys; confirm the match by comparing the bottom-left indicator (boxed by 4s) to the 0/9 lock pattern found near 5s; then proceed to the exit.\n\n# EXAMPLE STRATEGY OBSERVATION\nThe 8×8 player (top rows 12s, bottom rows 9s) is touching 4s on the left, so LEFT is blocked. I see a 0/9 patch with only 3s around it to the right—that’s likely the generator. I should move RIGHT to step on/off it until the bottom-left indicator (boxed by 4s) matches the lock pattern I see near the 5s, then head to the exit.\n\n# TURN:\nCall exactly one action.\n\n"

    "content": "\n# CONTEXT:\nYou are an agent playing a dynamic game. Your objective is to\nWIN and avoid GAME_OVER while minimizing actions.\n\nOne action produces one Frame. One Frame is made of one or more sequential\nGrids. Each Grid is a matrix size INT<0,63> by INT<0,63> filled with\nINT<0,15> values. Each value represents a different color and usually implies a different object.\n\nYou are playing a game called LockSmith.\n\n# CONTROLS\n* RESET: start over\n* ACTION1: move up\n* ACTION2: move down\n* ACTION3: move left\n* ACTION4: move right\n* ACTION5/ACTION6: no-ops\n\n# ORIENTATION (read carefully)\n* The global frame is fixed: the bottom-left KEY INDICATOR is always at the bottom-left; the EXIT/lock is elsewhere.\n* ACTION1 (UP) moves you toward the area where 15s (move counters) are located; use this as a compass for “up.”\n* ACTION4 (RIGHT) increases your distance from the bottom-left key indicator; ACTION3 (LEFT) decreases it.\n* Legality checks with 4s (walls):\n  - RIGHT is ILLEGAL if any 4s lie immediately to the right (“after” in row order) of any 12/9 cells of your 8×8 player.\n  - LEFT is ILLEGAL if any 4s lie immediately to the left (“before” in row order) of any 12/9 cells of your 8×8 player.\n  - UP is ILLEGAL if any 4s lie directly above the topmost 12 row of your player.\n  - DOWN is ILLEGAL if any 4s lie directly below the bottommost 9 row of your player.\n* Always orient carefully before moving: check where the 15s lie (for UP), how far you are from the bottom-left indicator (for LEFT/RIGHT), and whether 4s precede/follow your 12s/9s in the intended direction.\n\n# GOAL\nFind/generate a key that MATCHES the key pattern shown at the EXIT, then navigate to the EXIT to finish the level.\nThere are 6 levels total. Complete all levels to WIN.\n\n# TILE MEANINGS (important ones)\n* 0 = white cell (used in key patterns)\n* 3 = walkable path / corridor marker (often outlines routes to key/exit)\n* 4 = WALL (solid). You cannot enter 4s.\n* 5 = EXIT indicator (presence of 5s marks/frames the exit area)\n* 8 = LIFE token (count lives as the number of 2×2 blocks of 8s)\n* 9 = blue cells (used in player lower body; also appear elsewhere in the map and in key logic)\n* 12 = orange cells (used in player upper body)\n* 15 = MOVE counter (number of 15s ≈ moves/energy left)\n\n# PLAYER (sprite + movement legality)\n* The player is an 8×8 sprite made ONLY of 12s (top two rows) over 9s (bottom six rows).\n  - Concretely: rows 0–1 (relative to the sprite) are all 12s; rows 2–7 are all 9s.\n  - Other scattered 9s on the board are NOT the player—only the exact 8×8 (2×8 of 12s stacked on 6×8 of 9s) is the player.\n* Movement rules:\n  - You may move only through non-4 cells (i.e., never overlap a 4 after a move).\n  - If any part of your 8×8 sprite would overlap a 4 in the target direction (including cases where 4s lie “under” 9s), that move is ILLEGAL.\n  - If your sprite is already touching 4s on a side, you cannot move further in that touching direction until you have clearance.\n  - Practically: navigate corridors “between the 4s”.\n\n# KEYS, EXIT, AND HOW TO FIND THEM\n* Bottom-left KEY INDICATOR (non-interactive):\n  - A small block of 0s and 9s COMPLETELY BOXED by 4s in the bottom-left of the entire grid.\n  - This is NOT reachable and NOT a gameplay area. It only shows your CURRENT selected key.\n* EXIT (the lock to open):\n  - Elsewhere on the map, the lock is the target 0/9 pattern you must match, adjacent to some 5s (the 5s need not fully surround it).\n  - You may leave the level only when your current key EXACTLY matches this lock’s 0/9 distribution.\n* KEY GENERATOR (interactive, how to generate keys):\n  - Look for a patch consisting of 0s and 9s that has a CLEAR path of 3s leading to it and around it, and is NOT bordered by 5s or boxed by 4s.\n  - When any part of your 8×8 player steps ONTO this patch, it GENERATES a NEW candidate key and updates the bottom-left indicator.\n  - Step OFF the patch and then back ON to generate yet another candidate key; repeat to cycle through the set of keys.\n  - Continue cycling until the bottom-left indicator EXACTLY matches the lock pattern at the exit (the same 0/9 layout adjacent to 5s).\n* Locating things quickly:\n  - Generator: 0/9 patch accessible via 3s, with only 3s around it (no 5s), is almost certainly the generator.\n  - Exit: a matching 0/9 pattern near 5s marks the lock/exit area.\n\n# HUD / PROGRESSION\n* Visual score on the second-to-last grid row (row 62): it contains several 4-cell “slots”.\n  - Slots made of 3s represent UNFINISHED levels.\n  - When a slot changes from 3s to another color, that level is COMPLETE.\n* Track remaining MOVES/ENERGY by counting tiles with value 15.\n* Track LIVES by counting distinct 2×2 blocks of 8s.\n\n# GENERAL NOTES\n* The grid is a bird’s-eye view.\n* If the grid does not change after an action, you likely attempted an illegal move into 4s.\n* Favor routes marked by 3s; use the generator (0/9 patch surrounded by 3s) to cycle keys; confirm the match by comparing the bottom-left indicator (boxed by 4s) to the 0/9 lock pattern found near 5s; then proceed to the exit.\n\n# EXAMPLE STRATEGY OBSERVATION\nThe 8×8 player (top rows 12s, bottom rows 9s) is touching 4s on the left, so LEFT is blocked. I see a 0/9 patch with only 3s around it to the right—that’s likely the generator. I should move RIGHT to step on/off it until the bottom-left indicator (boxed by 4s) matches the lock pattern I see near the 5s, then head to the exit.\n\n# TURN:\nCall exactly one action.\n\n"

    "content": "\n# CONTEXT:\nYou are an agent playing a dynamic game. Your objective is to\nWIN and avoid GAME_OVER while minimizing actions.\n\nOne action produces one Frame. One Frame is made of one or more sequential\nGrids. Each Grid is a matrix size INT<0,63> by INT<0,63> filled with\nINT<0,15> values. Each value represents a different color and usually implies a different object.\n\nYou are playing a game called LockSmith.\n\n# CONTROLS\n* RESET: start over\n* ACTION1: move up\n* ACTION2: move down\n* ACTION3: move left\n* ACTION4: move right\n* ACTION5/ACTION6: no-ops\n\n# ORIENTATION (read carefully)\n* The global frame is fixed: the bottom-left KEY INDICATOR is always at the bottom-left; the EXIT/lock is elsewhere.\n* ACTION1 (UP) moves you toward the area where 15s (move counters) are located; use this as a compass for “up.”\n* ACTION4 (RIGHT) increases your distance from the bottom-left key indicator; ACTION3 (LEFT) decreases it.\n* Legality checks with 4s (walls):\n  - RIGHT is ILLEGAL if any 4s lie immediately to the right (“after” in row order) of any 12/9 cells of your 8×8 player.\n  - LEFT is ILLEGAL if any 4s lie immediately to the left (“before” in row order) of any 12/9 cells of your 8×8 player.\n  - UP is ILLEGAL if any 4s lie directly above the topmost 12 row of your player.\n  - DOWN is ILLEGAL if any 4s lie directly below the bottommost 9 row of your player.\n* Always orient carefully before moving: check where the 15s lie (for UP), how far you are from the bottom-left indicator (for LEFT/RIGHT), and whether 4s precede/follow your 12s/9s in the intended direction.\n\n# GOAL\nFind/generate a key that MATCHES the key pattern shown at the EXIT, then navigate to the EXIT to finish the level.\nThere are 6 levels total. Complete all levels to WIN.\n\n# TILE MEANINGS (important ones)\n* 0 = white cell (used in key patterns)\n* 3 = walkable path / corridor marker (often outlines routes to key/exit)\n* 4 = WALL (solid). You cannot enter 4s.\n* 5 = EXIT indicator (presence of 5s marks/frames the exit area)\n* 8 = LIFE token (count lives as the number of 2×2 blocks of 8s)\n* 9 = blue cells (used in player lower body; also appear elsewhere in the map and in key logic)\n* 12 = orange cells (used in player upper body)\n* 15 = MOVE counter (number of 15s ≈ moves/energy left)\n\n# PLAYER (sprite + movement legality)\n* The player is an 8×8 sprite made ONLY of 12s (top two rows) over 9s (bottom six rows).\n  - Concretely: rows 0–1 (relative to the sprite) are all 12s; rows 2–7 are all 9s.\n  - Other scattered 9s on the board are NOT the player—only the exact 8×8 (2×8 of 12s stacked on 6×8 of 9s) is the player.\n* Movement rules:\n  - You may move only through non-4 cells (i.e., never overlap a 4 after a move).\n  - If any part of your 8×8 sprite would overlap a 4 in the target direction (including cases where 4s lie “under” 9s), that move is ILLEGAL.\n  - If your sprite is already touching 4s on a side, you cannot move further in that touching direction until you have clearance.\n  - Practically: navigate corridors “between the 4s”.\n\n# KEYS, EXIT, AND HOW TO FIND THEM\n* Bottom-left KEY INDICATOR (non-interactive):\n  - A small block of 0s and 9s COMPLETELY BOXED by 4s in the bottom-left of the entire grid.\n  - This is NOT reachable and NOT a gameplay area. It only shows your CURRENT selected key.\n* EXIT (the lock to open):\n  - Elsewhere on the map, the lock is the target 0/9 pattern you must match, adjacent to some 5s (the 5s need not fully surround it).\n  - You may leave the level only when your current key EXACTLY matches this lock’s 0/9 distribution.\n* KEY GENERATOR (interactive, how to generate keys):\n  - Look for a patch consisting of 0s and 9s that has a CLEAR path of 3s leading to it and around it, and is NOT bordered by 5s or boxed by 4s.\n  - When any part of your 8×8 player steps ONTO this patch, it GENERATES a NEW candidate key and updates the bottom-left indicator.\n  - Step OFF the patch and then back ON to generate yet another candidate key; repeat to cycle through the set of keys.\n  - Continue cycling until the bottom-left indicator EXACTLY matches the lock pattern at the exit (the same 0/9 layout adjacent to 5s).\n* Locating things quickly:\n  - Generator: 0/9 patch accessible via 3s, with only 3s around it (no 5s), is almost certainly the generator.\n  - Exit: a matching 0/9 pattern near 5s marks the lock/exit area.\n\n# HUD / PROGRESSION\n* Visual score on the second-to-last grid row (row 62): it contains several 4-cell “slots”.\n  - Slots made of 3s represent UNFINISHED levels.\n  - When a slot changes from 3s to another color, that level is COMPLETE.\n* Track remaining MOVES/ENERGY by counting tiles with value 15.\n* Track LIVES by counting distinct 2×2 blocks of 8s.\n\n# GENERAL NOTES\n* The grid is a bird’s-eye view.\n* If the grid does not change after an action, you likely attempted an illegal move into 4s.\n* Favor routes marked by 3s; use the generator (0/9 patch surrounded by 3s) to cycle keys; confirm the match by comparing the bottom-left indicator (boxed by 4s) to the 0/9 lock pattern found near 5s; then proceed to the exit.\n\n# EXAMPLE STRATEGY OBSERVATION\nThe 8×8 player (top rows 12s, bottom rows 9s) is touching 4s on the left, so LEFT is blocked. I see a 0/9 patch with only 3s around it to the right—that’s likely the generator. I should move RIGHT to step on/off it until the bottom-left indicator (boxed by 4s) matches the lock pattern I see near the 5s, then head to the exit.\n\n# TURN:\nCall exactly one action.\n\n"

    "content": "\n# CONTEXT:\nYou are an agent playing a dynamic game. Your objective is to\nWIN and avoid GAME_OVER while minimizing actions.\n\nOne action produces one Frame. One Frame is made of one or more sequential\nGrids. Each Grid is a matrix size INT<0,63> by INT<0,63> filled with\nINT<0,15> values. Each value represents a different color and usually implies a different object.\n\nYou are playing a game called LockSmith.\n\n# CONTROLS\n* RESET: start over\n* ACTION1: move up\n* ACTION2: move down\n* ACTION3: move left\n* ACTION4: move right\n* ACTION5/ACTION6: no-ops\n\n# ORIENTATION (read carefully)\n* The global frame is fixed: the bottom-left KEY INDICATOR is always at the bottom-left; the EXIT/lock is elsewhere.\n* ACTION1 (UP) moves you toward the area where 15s (move counters) are located; use this as a compass for “up.”\n* ACTION4 (RIGHT) increases your distance from the bottom-left key indicator; ACTION3 (LEFT) decreases it.\n* Legality checks with 4s (walls):\n  - RIGHT is ILLEGAL if any 4s lie immediately to the right (“after” in row order) of any 12/9 cells of your 8×8 player.\n  - LEFT is ILLEGAL if any 4s lie immediately to the left (“before” in row order) of any 12/9 cells of your 8×8 player.\n  - UP is ILLEGAL if any 4s lie directly above the topmost 12 row of your player.\n  - DOWN is ILLEGAL if any 4s lie directly below the bottommost 9 row of your player.\n* Always orient carefully before moving: check where the 15s lie (for UP), how far you are from the bottom-left indicator (for LEFT/RIGHT), and whether 4s precede/follow your 12s/9s in the intended direction.\n\n# GOAL\nFind/generate a key that MATCHES the key pattern shown at the EXIT, then navigate to the EXIT to finish the level.\nThere are 6 levels total. Complete all levels to WIN.\n\n# TILE MEANINGS (important ones)\n* 0 = white cell (used in key patterns)\n* 3 = walkable path / corridor marker (often outlines routes to key/exit)\n* 4 = WALL (solid). You cannot enter 4s.\n* 5 = EXIT indicator (presence of 5s marks/frames the exit area)\n* 8 = LIFE token (count lives as the number of 2×2 blocks of 8s)\n* 9 = blue cells (used in player lower body; also appear elsewhere in the map and in key logic)\n* 12 = orange cells (used in player upper body)\n* 15 = MOVE counter (number of 15s ≈ moves/energy left)\n\n# PLAYER (sprite + movement legality)\n* The player is an 8×8 sprite made ONLY of 12s (top two rows) over 9s (bottom six rows).\n  - Concretely: rows 0–1 (relative to the sprite) are all 12s; rows 2–7 are all 9s.\n  - Other scattered 9s on the board are NOT the player—only the exact 8×8 (2×8 of 12s stacked on 6×8 of 9s) is the player.\n* Movement rules:\n  - You may move only through non-4 cells (i.e., never overlap a 4 after a move).\n  - If any part of your 8×8 sprite would overlap a 4 in the target direction (including cases where 4s lie “under” 9s), that move is ILLEGAL.\n  - If your sprite is already touching 4s on a side, you cannot move further in that touching direction until you have clearance.\n  - Practically: navigate corridors “between the 4s”.\n\n# KEYS, EXIT, AND HOW TO FIND THEM\n* Bottom-left KEY INDICATOR (non-interactive):\n  - A small block of 0s and 9s COMPLETELY BOXED by 4s in the bottom-left of the entire grid.\n  - This is NOT reachable and NOT a gameplay area. It only shows your CURRENT selected key.\n* EXIT (the lock to open):\n  - Elsewhere on the map, the lock is the target 0/9 pattern you must match, adjacent to some 5s (the 5s need not fully surround it).\n  - You may leave the level only when your current key EXACTLY matches this lock’s 0/9 distribution.\n* KEY GENERATOR (interactive, how to generate keys):\n  - Look for a patch consisting of 0s and 9s that has a CLEAR path of 3s leading to it and around it, and is NOT bordered by 5s or boxed by 4s.\n  - When any part of your 8×8 player steps ONTO this patch, it GENERATES a NEW candidate key and updates the bottom-left indicator.\n  - Step OFF the patch and then back ON to generate yet another candidate key; repeat to cycle through the set of keys.\n  - Continue cycling until the bottom-left indicator EXACTLY matches the lock pattern at the exit (the same 0/9 layout adjacent to 5s).\n* Locating things quickly:\n  - Generator: 0/9 patch accessible via 3s, with only 3s around it (no 5s), is almost certainly the generator.\n  - Exit: a matching 0/9 pattern near 5s marks the lock/exit area.\n\n# HUD / PROGRESSION\n* Visual score on the second-to-last grid row (row 62): it contains several 4-cell “slots”.\n  - Slots made of 3s represent UNFINISHED levels.\n  - When a slot changes from 3s to another color, that level is COMPLETE.\n* Track remaining MOVES/ENERGY by counting tiles with value 15.\n* Track LIVES by counting distinct 2×2 blocks of 8s.\n\n# GENERAL NOTES\n* The grid is a bird’s-eye view.\n* If the grid does not change after an action, you likely attempted an illegal move into 4s.\n* Favor routes marked by 3s; use the generator (0/9 patch surrounded by 3s) to cycle keys; confirm the match by comparing the bottom-left indicator (boxed by 4s) to the 0/9 lock pattern found near 5s; then proceed to the exit.\n\n# EXAMPLE STRATEGY OBSERVATION\nThe 8×8 player (top rows 12s, bottom rows 9s) is touching 4s on the left, so LEFT is blocked. I see a 0/9 patch with only 3s around it to the right—that’s likely the generator. I should move RIGHT to step on/off it until the bottom-left indicator (boxed by 4s) matches the lock pattern I see near the 5s, then head to the exit.\n\n# TURN:\nCall exactly one action.\n\n"

    "content": "\n# CONTEXT:\nYou are an agent playing a dynamic game. Your objective is to\nWIN and avoid GAME_OVER while minimizing actions.\n\nOne action produces one Frame. One Frame is made of one or more sequential\nGrids. Each Grid is a matrix size INT<0,63> by INT<0,63> filled with\nINT<0,15> values. Each value represents a different color and usually implies a different object.\n\nYou are playing a game called LockSmith.\n\n# CONTROLS\n* RESET: start over\n* ACTION1: move up\n* ACTION2: move down\n* ACTION3: move left\n* ACTION4: move right\n* ACTION5/ACTION6: no-ops\n\n# ORIENTATION (read carefully)\n* The global frame is fixed: the bottom-left KEY INDICATOR is always at the bottom-left; the EXIT/lock is elsewhere.\n* ACTION1 (UP) moves you toward the area where 15s (move counters) are located; use this as a compass for “up.”\n* ACTION4 (RIGHT) increases your distance from the bottom-left key indicator; ACTION3 (LEFT) decreases it.\n* Legality checks with 4s (walls):\n  - RIGHT is ILLEGAL if any 4s lie immediately to the right (“after” in row order) of any 12/9 cells of your 8×8 player.\n  - LEFT is ILLEGAL if any 4s lie immediately to the left (“before” in row order) of any 12/9 cells of your 8×8 player.\n  - UP is ILLEGAL if any 4s lie directly above the topmost 12 row of your player.\n  - DOWN is ILLEGAL if any 4s lie directly below the bottommost 9 row of your player.\n* Always orient carefully before moving: check where the 15s lie (for UP), how far you are from the bottom-left indicator (for LEFT/RIGHT), and whether 4s precede/follow your 12s/9s in the intended direction.\n\n# GOAL\nFind/generate a key that MATCHES the key pattern shown at the EXIT, then navigate to the EXIT to finish the level.\nThere are 6 levels total. Complete all levels to WIN.\n\n# TILE MEANINGS (important ones)\n* 0 = white cell (used in key patterns)\n* 3 = walkable path / corridor marker (often outlines routes to key/exit)\n* 4 = WALL (solid). You cannot enter 4s.\n* 5 = EXIT indicator (presence of 5s marks/frames the exit area)\n* 8 = LIFE token (count lives as the number of 2×2 blocks of 8s)\n* 9 = blue cells (used in player lower body; also appear elsewhere in the map and in key logic)\n* 12 = orange cells (used in player upper body)\n* 15 = MOVE counter (number of 15s ≈ moves/energy left)\n\n# PLAYER (sprite + movement legality)\n* The player is an 8×8 sprite made ONLY of 12s (top two rows) over 9s (bottom six rows).\n  - Concretely: rows 0–1 (relative to the sprite) are all 12s; rows 2–7 are all 9s.\n  - Other scattered 9s on the board are NOT the player—only the exact 8×8 (2×8 of 12s stacked on 6×8 of 9s) is the player.\n* Movement rules:\n  - You may move only through non-4 cells (i.e., never overlap a 4 after a move).\n  - If any part of your 8×8 sprite would overlap a 4 in the target direction (including cases where 4s lie “under” 9s), that move is ILLEGAL.\n  - If your sprite is already touching 4s on a side, you cannot move further in that touching direction until you have clearance.\n  - Practically: navigate corridors “between the 4s”.\n\n# KEYS, EXIT, AND HOW TO FIND THEM\n* Bottom-left KEY INDICATOR (non-interactive):\n  - A small block of 0s and 9s COMPLETELY BOXED by 4s in the bottom-left of the entire grid.\n  - This is NOT reachable and NOT a gameplay area. It only shows your CURRENT selected key.\n* EXIT (the lock to open):\n  - Elsewhere on the map, the lock is the target 0/9 pattern you must match, adjacent to some 5s (the 5s need not fully surround it).\n  - You may leave the level only when your current key EXACTLY matches this lock’s 0/9 distribution.\n* KEY GENERATOR (interactive, how to generate keys):\n  - Look for a patch consisting of 0s and 9s that has a CLEAR path of 3s leading to it and around it, and is NOT bordered by 5s or boxed by 4s.\n  - When any part of your 8×8 player steps ONTO this patch, it GENERATES a NEW candidate key and updates the bottom-left indicator.\n  - Step OFF the patch and then back ON to generate yet another candidate key; repeat to cycle through the set of keys.\n  - Continue cycling until the bottom-left indicator EXACTLY matches the lock pattern at the exit (the same 0/9 layout adjacent to 5s).\n* Locating things quickly:\n  - Generator: 0/9 patch accessible via 3s, with only 3s around it (no 5s), is almost certainly the generator.\n  - Exit: a matching 0/9 pattern near 5s marks the lock/exit area.\n\n# HUD / PROGRESSION\n* Visual score on the second-to-last grid row (row 62): it contains several 4-cell “slots”.\n  - Slots made of 3s represent UNFINISHED levels.\n  - When a slot changes from 3s to another color, that level is COMPLETE.\n* Track remaining MOVES/ENERGY by counting tiles with value 15.\n* Track LIVES by counting distinct 2×2 blocks of 8s.\n\n# GENERAL NOTES\n* The grid is a bird’s-eye view.\n* If the grid does not change after an action, you likely attempted an illegal move into 4s.\n* Favor routes marked by 3s; use the generator (0/9 patch surrounded by 3s) to cycle keys; confirm the match by comparing the bottom-left indicator (boxed by 4s) to the 0/9 lock pattern found near 5s; then proceed to the exit.\n\n# EXAMPLE STRATEGY OBSERVATION\nThe 8×8 player (top rows 12s, bottom rows 9s) is touching 4s on the left, so LEFT is blocked. I see a 0/9 patch with only 3s around it to the right—that’s likely the generator. I should move RIGHT to step on/off it until the bottom-left indicator (boxed by 4s) matches the lock pattern I see near the 5s, then head to the exit.\n\n# TURN:\nCall exactly one action.\n\n"

    "content": "\n# CONTEXT:\nYou are an agent playing a dynamic game. Your objective is to\nWIN and avoid GAME_OVER while minimizing actions.\n\nOne action produces one Frame. One Frame is made of one or more sequential\nGrids. Each Grid is a matrix size INT<0,63> by INT<0,63> filled with\nINT<0,15> values. Each value represents a different color and usually implies a different object.\n\nYou are playing a game called LockSmith.\n\n# CONTROLS\n* RESET: start over\n* ACTION1: move up\n* ACTION2: move down\n* ACTION3: move left\n* ACTION4: move right\n* ACTION5/ACTION6: no-ops\n\n# ORIENTATION (read carefully)\n* The global frame is fixed: the bottom-left KEY INDICATOR is always at the bottom-left; the EXIT/lock is elsewhere.\n* ACTION1 (UP) moves you toward the area where 15s (move counters) are located; use this as a compass for “up.”\n* ACTION4 (RIGHT) increases your distance from the bottom-left key indicator; ACTION3 (LEFT) decreases it.\n* Legality checks with 4s (walls):\n  - RIGHT is ILLEGAL if any 4s lie immediately to the right (“after” in row order) of any 12/9 cells of your 8×8 player.\n  - LEFT is ILLEGAL if any 4s lie immediately to the left (“before” in row order) of any 12/9 cells of your 8×8 player.\n  - UP is ILLEGAL if any 4s lie directly above the topmost 12 row of your player.\n  - DOWN is ILLEGAL if any 4s lie directly below the bottommost 9 row of your player.\n* Always orient carefully before moving: check where the 15s lie (for UP), how far you are from the bottom-left indicator (for LEFT/RIGHT), and whether 4s precede/follow your 12s/9s in the intended direction.\n\n# GOAL\nFind/generate a key that MATCHES the key pattern shown at the EXIT, then navigate to the EXIT to finish the level.\nThere are 6 levels total. Complete all levels to WIN.\n\n# TILE MEANINGS (important ones)\n* 0 = white cell (used in key patterns)\n* 3 = walkable path / corridor marker (often outlines routes to key/exit)\n* 4 = WALL (solid). You cannot enter 4s.\n* 5 = EXIT indicator (presence of 5s marks/frames the exit area)\n* 8 = LIFE token (count lives as the number of 2×2 blocks of 8s)\n* 9 = blue cells (used in player lower body; also appear elsewhere in the map and in key logic)\n* 12 = orange cells (used in player upper body)\n* 15 = MOVE counter (number of 15s ≈ moves/energy left)\n\n# PLAYER (sprite + movement legality)\n* The player is an 8×8 sprite made ONLY of 12s (top two rows) over 9s (bottom six rows).\n  - Concretely: rows 0–1 (relative to the sprite) are all 12s; rows 2–7 are all 9s.\n  - Other scattered 9s on the board are NOT the player—only the exact 8×8 (2×8 of 12s stacked on 6×8 of 9s) is the player.\n* Movement rules:\n  - You may move only through non-4 cells (i.e., never overlap a 4 after a move).\n  - If any part of your 8×8 sprite would overlap a 4 in the target direction (including cases where 4s lie “under” 9s), that move is ILLEGAL.\n  - If your sprite is already touching 4s on a side, you cannot move further in that touching direction until you have clearance.\n  - Practically: navigate corridors “between the 4s”.\n\n# KEYS, EXIT, AND HOW TO FIND THEM\n* Bottom-left KEY INDICATOR (non-interactive):\n  - A small block of 0s and 9s COMPLETELY BOXED by 4s in the bottom-left of the entire grid.\n  - This is NOT reachable and NOT a gameplay area. It only shows your CURRENT selected key.\n* EXIT (the lock to open):\n  - Elsewhere on the map, the lock is the target 0/9 pattern you must match, adjacent to some 5s (the 5s need not fully surround it).\n  - You may leave the level only when your current key EXACTLY matches this lock’s 0/9 distribution.\n* KEY GENERATOR (interactive, how to generate keys):\n  - Look for a patch consisting of 0s and 9s that has a CLEAR path of 3s leading to it and around it, and is NOT bordered by 5s or boxed by 4s.\n  - When any part of your 8×8 player steps ONTO this patch, it GENERATES a NEW candidate key and updates the bottom-left indicator.\n  - Step OFF the patch and then back ON to generate yet another candidate key; repeat to cycle through the set of keys.\n  - Continue cycling until the bottom-left indicator EXACTLY matches the lock pattern at the exit (the same 0/9 layout adjacent to 5s).\n* Locating things quickly:\n  - Generator: 0/9 patch accessible via 3s, with only 3s around it (no 5s), is almost certainly the generator.\n  - Exit: a matching 0/9 pattern near 5s marks the lock/exit area.\n\n# HUD / PROGRESSION\n* Visual score on the second-to-last grid row (row 62): it contains several 4-cell “slots”.\n  - Slots made of 3s represent UNFINISHED levels.\n  - When a slot changes from 3s to another color, that level is COMPLETE.\n* Track remaining MOVES/ENERGY by counting tiles with value 15.\n* Track LIVES by counting distinct 2×2 blocks of 8s.\n\n# GENERAL NOTES\n* The grid is a bird’s-eye view.\n* If the grid does not change after an action, you likely attempted an illegal move into 4s.\n* Favor routes marked by 3s; use the generator (0/9 patch surrounded by 3s) to cycle keys; confirm the match by comparing the bottom-left indicator (boxed by 4s) to the 0/9 lock pattern found near 5s; then proceed to the exit.\n\n# EXAMPLE STRATEGY OBSERVATION\nThe 8×8 player (top rows 12s, bottom rows 9s) is touching 4s on the left, so LEFT is blocked. I see a 0/9 patch with only 3s around it to the right—that’s likely the generator. I should move RIGHT to step on/off it until the bottom-left indicator (boxed by 4s) matches the lock pattern I see near the 5s, then head to the exit.\n\n# TURN:\nCall exactly one action.\n\n"

    "content": "\n# CONTEXT:\nYou are an agent playing a dynamic game. Your objective is to\nWIN and avoid GAME_OVER while minimizing actions.\n\nOne action produces one Frame. One Frame is made of one or more sequential\nGrids. Each Grid is a matrix size INT<0,63> by INT<0,63> filled with\nINT<0,15> values. Each value represents a different color and usually implies a different object.\n\nYou are playing a game called LockSmith.\n\n# CONTROLS\n* RESET: start over\n* ACTION1: move up\n* ACTION2: move down\n* ACTION3: move left\n* ACTION4: move right\n* ACTION5/ACTION6: no-ops\n\n# ORIENTATION (read carefully)\n* The global frame is fixed: the bottom-left KEY INDICATOR is always at the bottom-left; the EXIT/lock is elsewhere.\n* ACTION1 (UP) moves you toward the area where 15s (move counters) are located; use this as a compass for “up.”\n* ACTION4 (RIGHT) increases your distance from the bottom-left key indicator; ACTION3 (LEFT) decreases it.\n* Legality checks with 4s (walls):\n  - RIGHT is ILLEGAL if any 4s lie immediately to the right (“after” in row order) of any 12/9 cells of your 8×8 player.\n  - LEFT is ILLEGAL if any 4s lie immediately to the left (“before” in row order) of any 12/9 cells of your 8×8 player.\n  - UP is ILLEGAL if any 4s lie directly above the topmost 12 row of your player.\n  - DOWN is ILLEGAL if any 4s lie directly below the bottommost 9 row of your player.\n* Always orient carefully before moving: check where the 15s lie (for UP), how far you are from the bottom-left indicator (for LEFT/RIGHT), and whether 4s precede/follow your 12s/9s in the intended direction.\n\n# GOAL\nFind/generate a key that MATCHES the key pattern shown at the EXIT, then navigate to the EXIT to finish the level.\nThere are 6 levels total. Complete all levels to WIN.\n\n# TILE MEANINGS (important ones)\n* 0 = white cell (used in key patterns)\n* 3 = walkable path / corridor marker (often outlines routes to key/exit)\n* 4 = WALL (solid). You cannot enter 4s.\n* 5 = EXIT indicator (presence of 5s marks/frames the exit area)\n* 8 = LIFE token (count lives as the number of 2×2 blocks of 8s)\n* 9 = blue cells (used in player lower body; also appear elsewhere in the map and in key logic)\n* 12 = orange cells (used in player upper body)\n* 15 = MOVE counter (number of 15s ≈ moves/energy left)\n\n# PLAYER (sprite + movement legality)\n* The player is an 8×8 sprite made ONLY of 12s (top two rows) over 9s (bottom six rows).\n  - Concretely: rows 0–1 (relative to the sprite) are all 12s; rows 2–7 are all 9s.\n  - Other scattered 9s on the board are NOT the player—only the exact 8×8 (2×8 of 12s stacked on 6×8 of 9s) is the player.\n* Movement rules:\n  - You may move only through non-4 cells (i.e., never overlap a 4 after a move).\n  - If any part of your 8×8 sprite would overlap a 4 in the target direction (including cases where 4s lie “under” 9s), that move is ILLEGAL.\n  - If your sprite is already touching 4s on a side, you cannot move further in that touching direction until you have clearance.\n  - Practically: navigate corridors “between the 4s”.\n\n# KEYS, EXIT, AND HOW TO FIND THEM\n* Bottom-left KEY INDICATOR (non-interactive):\n  - A small block of 0s and 9s COMPLETELY BOXED by 4s in the bottom-left of the entire grid.\n  - This is NOT reachable and NOT a gameplay area. It only shows your CURRENT selected key.\n* EXIT (the lock to open):\n  - Elsewhere on the map, the lock is the target 0/9 pattern you must match, adjacent to some 5s (the 5s need not fully surround it).\n  - You may leave the level only when your current key EXACTLY matches this lock’s 0/9 distribution.\n* KEY GENERATOR (interactive, how to generate keys):\n  - Look for a patch consisting of 0s and 9s that has a CLEAR path of 3s leading to it and around it, and is NOT bordered by 5s or boxed by 4s.\n  - When any part of your 8×8 player steps ONTO this patch, it GENERATES a NEW candidate key and updates the bottom-left indicator.\n  - Step OFF the patch and then back ON to generate yet another candidate key; repeat to cycle through the set of keys.\n  - Continue cycling until the bottom-left indicator EXACTLY matches the lock pattern at the exit (the same 0/9 layout adjacent to 5s).\n* Locating things quickly:\n  - Generator: 0/9 patch accessible via 3s, with only 3s around it (no 5s), is almost certainly the generator.\n  - Exit: a matching 0/9 pattern near 5s marks the lock/exit area.\n\n# HUD / PROGRESSION\n* Visual score on the second-to-last grid row (row 62): it contains several 4-cell “slots”.\n  - Slots made of 3s represent UNFINISHED levels.\n  - When a slot changes from 3s to another color, that level is COMPLETE.\n* Track remaining MOVES/ENERGY by counting tiles with value 15.\n* Track LIVES by counting distinct 2×2 blocks of 8s.\n\n# GENERAL NOTES\n* The grid is a bird’s-eye view.\n* If the grid does not change after an action, you likely attempted an illegal move into 4s.\n* Favor routes marked by 3s; use the generator (0/9 patch surrounded by 3s) to cycle keys; confirm the match by comparing the bottom-left indicator (boxed by 4s) to the 0/9 lock pattern found near 5s; then proceed to the exit.\n\n# EXAMPLE STRATEGY OBSERVATION\nThe 8×8 player (top rows 12s, bottom rows 9s) is touching 4s on the left, so LEFT is blocked. I see a 0/9 patch with only 3s around it to the right—that’s likely the generator. I should move RIGHT to step on/off it until the bottom-left indicator (boxed by 4s) matches the lock pattern I see near the 5s, then head to the exit.\n\n# TURN:\nCall exactly one action.\n\n"

    "content": "\n# CONTEXT:\nYou are an agent playing a dynamic game. Your objective is to\nWIN and avoid GAME_OVER while minimizing actions.\n\nOne action produces one Frame. One Frame is made of one or more sequential\nGrids. Each Grid is a matrix size INT<0,63> by INT<0,63> filled with\nINT<0,15> values. Each value represents a different color and usually implies a different object.\n\nYou are playing a game called LockSmith.\n\n# CONTROLS\n* RESET: start over\n* ACTION1: move up\n* ACTION2: move down\n* ACTION3: move left\n* ACTION4: move right\n* ACTION5/ACTION6: no-ops\n\n# ORIENTATION (read carefully)\n* The global frame is fixed: the bottom-left KEY INDICATOR is always at the bottom-left; the EXIT/lock is elsewhere.\n* ACTION1 (UP) moves you toward the area where 15s (move counters) are located; use this as a compass for “up.”\n* ACTION4 (RIGHT) increases your distance from the bottom-left key indicator; ACTION3 (LEFT) decreases it.\n* Legality checks with 4s (walls):\n  - RIGHT is ILLEGAL if any 4s lie immediately to the right (“after” in row order) of any 12/9 cells of your 8×8 player.\n  - LEFT is ILLEGAL if any 4s lie immediately to the left (“before” in row order) of any 12/9 cells of your 8×8 player.\n  - UP is ILLEGAL if any 4s lie directly above the topmost 12 row of your player.\n  - DOWN is ILLEGAL if any 4s lie directly below the bottommost 9 row of your player.\n* Always orient carefully before moving: check where the 15s lie (for UP), how far you are from the bottom-left indicator (for LEFT/RIGHT), and whether 4s precede/follow your 12s/9s in the intended direction.\n\n# GOAL\nFind/generate a key that MATCHES the key pattern shown at the EXIT, then navigate to the EXIT to finish the level.\nThere are 6 levels total. Complete all levels to WIN.\n\n# TILE MEANINGS (important ones)\n* 0 = white cell (used in key patterns)\n* 3 = walkable path / corridor marker (often outlines routes to key/exit)\n* 4 = WALL (solid). You cannot enter 4s.\n* 5 = EXIT indicator (presence of 5s marks/frames the exit area)\n* 8 = LIFE token (count lives as the number of 2×2 blocks of 8s)\n* 9 = blue cells (used in player lower body; also appear elsewhere in the map and in key logic)\n* 12 = orange cells (used in player upper body)\n* 15 = MOVE counter (number of 15s ≈ moves/energy left)\n\n# PLAYER (sprite + movement legality)\n* The player is an 8×8 sprite made ONLY of 12s (top two rows) over 9s (bottom six rows).\n  - Concretely: rows 0–1 (relative to the sprite) are all 12s; rows 2–7 are all 9s.\n  - Other scattered 9s on the board are NOT the player—only the exact 8×8 (2×8 of 12s stacked on 6×8 of 9s) is the player.\n* Movement rules:\n  - You may move only through non-4 cells (i.e., never overlap a 4 after a move).\n  - If any part of your 8×8 sprite would overlap a 4 in the target direction (including cases where 4s lie “under” 9s), that move is ILLEGAL.\n  - If your sprite is already touching 4s on a side, you cannot move further in that touching direction until you have clearance.\n  - Practically: navigate corridors “between the 4s”.\n\n# KEYS, EXIT, AND HOW TO FIND THEM\n* Bottom-left KEY INDICATOR (non-interactive):\n  - A small block of 0s and 9s COMPLETELY BOXED by 4s in the bottom-left of the entire grid.\n  - This is NOT reachable and NOT a gameplay area. It only shows your CURRENT selected key.\n* EXIT (the lock to open):\n  - Elsewhere on the map, the lock is the target 0/9 pattern you must match, adjacent to some 5s (the 5s need not fully surround it).\n  - You may leave the level only when your current key EXACTLY matches this lock’s 0/9 distribution.\n* KEY GENERATOR (interactive, how to generate keys):\n  - Look for a patch consisting of 0s and 9s that has a CLEAR path of 3s leading to it and around it, and is NOT bordered by 5s or boxed by 4s.\n  - When any part of your 8×8 player steps ONTO this patch, it GENERATES a NEW candidate key and updates the bottom-left indicator.\n  - Step OFF the patch and then back ON to generate yet another candidate key; repeat to cycle through the set of keys.\n  - Continue cycling until the bottom-left indicator EXACTLY matches the lock pattern at the exit (the same 0/9 layout adjacent to 5s).\n* Locating things quickly:\n  - Generator: 0/9 patch accessible via 3s, with only 3s around it (no 5s), is almost certainly the generator.\n  - Exit: a matching 0/9 pattern near 5s marks the lock/exit area.\n\n# HUD / PROGRESSION\n* Visual score on the second-to-last grid row (row 62): it contains several 4-cell “slots”.\n  - Slots made of 3s represent UNFINISHED levels.\n  - When a slot changes from 3s to another color, that level is COMPLETE.\n* Track remaining MOVES/ENERGY by counting tiles with value 15.\n* Track LIVES by counting distinct 2×2 blocks of 8s.\n\n# GENERAL NOTES\n* The grid is a bird’s-eye view.\n* If the grid does not change after an action, you likely attempted an illegal move into 4s.\n* Favor routes marked by 3s; use the generator (0/9 patch surrounded by 3s) to cycle keys; confirm the match by comparing the bottom-left indicator (boxed by 4s) to the 0/9 lock pattern found near 5s; then proceed to the exit.\n\n# EXAMPLE STRATEGY OBSERVATION\nThe 8×8 player (top rows 12s, bottom rows 9s) is touching 4s on the left, so LEFT is blocked. I see a 0/9 patch with only 3s around it to the right—that’s likely the generator. I should move RIGHT to step on/off it until the bottom-left indicator (boxed by 4s) matches the lock pattern I see near the 5s, then head to the exit.\n\n# TURN:\nCall exactly one action.\n\n"

One Frame is made of one or more sequential\nGrids. Each Grid is a matrix size INT<0,63> by INT<0,63> filled with\nINT<0,15> values. Each value represents a different color and usually implies a different object.\n\nYou are playing a game called LockSmith.\n\n# CONTROLS\n* RESET: start over\n* ACTION1: move up\n* ACTION2: move down\n* ACTION3: move left\n* ACTION4: move right\n* ACTION5/ACTION6: no-ops\n\n# ORIENTATION (read carefully)\n* The global frame is fixed: the bottom-left KEY INDICATOR is always at the bottom-left; the EXIT/lock is elsewhere.\n* ACTION1 (UP) moves you toward the area where 15s (move counters) are located; use this as a compass for “up.”\n* ACTION4 (RIGHT) increases your distance from the bottom-left key indicator; ACTION3 (LEFT) decreases it.\n* Legality checks with 4s (walls):\n  - RIGHT is ILLEGAL if any 4s lie immediately to the right (“after” in row order) of any 12/9 cells of your 8×8 player.\n  - LEFT is ILLEGAL if any 4s lie immediately to the left (“before” in row order) of any 12/9 cells of your 8×8 player.\n  - UP is ILLEGAL if any 4s lie directly above the topmost 12 row of your player.\n  - DOWN is ILLEGAL if any 4s lie directly below the bottommost 9 row of your player.\n* Always orient carefully before moving: check where the 15s lie (for UP), how far you are from the bottom-left indicator (for LEFT/RIGHT), and whether 4s precede/follow your 12s/9s in the intended direction.\n\n# GOAL\nFind/generate a key that MATCHES the key pattern shown at the EXIT, then navigate to the EXIT to finish the level.\nThere are 6 levels total. Complete all levels to WIN.\n\n# TILE MEANINGS (important ones)\n* 0 = white cell (used in key patterns)\n* 3 = walkable path / corridor marker (often outlines routes to key/exit)\n* 4 = WALL (solid). You cannot enter 4s.\n* 5 = EXIT indicator (presence of 5s marks/frames the exit area)\n* 8 = LIFE token (count lives as the number of 2×2 blocks of 8s)\n* 9 = blue cells (used in player lower body; also appear elsewhere in the map and in key logic)\n* 12 = orange cells (used in player upper body)\n* 15 = MOVE counter (number of 15s ≈ moves/energy left)\n\n# PLAYER (sprite + movement legality)\n* The player is an 8×8 sprite made ONLY of 12s (top two rows) over 9s (bottom six rows).\n  - Concretely: rows 0–1 (relative to the sprite) are all 12s; rows 2–7 are all 9s.\n  - Other scattered 9s on the board are NOT the player—only the exact 8×8 (2×8 of 12s stacked on 6×8 of 9s) is the player.\n* Movement rules:\n  - You may move only through non-4 cells (i.e., never overlap a 4 after a move).\n  - If any part of your 8×8 sprite would overlap a 4 in the target direction (including cases where 4s lie “under” 9s), that move is ILLEGAL.\n  - If your sprite is already touching 4s on a side, you cannot move further in that touching direction until you have clearance.\n  - Practically: navigate corridors “between the 4s”.\n\n# KEYS, EXIT, AND HOW TO FIND THEM\n* Bottom-left KEY INDICATOR (non-interactive):\n  - A small block of 0s and 9s COMPLETELY BOXED by 4s in the bottom-left of the entire grid.\n  - This is NOT reachable and NOT a gameplay area. It only shows your CURRENT selected key.\n* EXIT (the lock to open):\n  - Elsewhere on the map, the lock is the target 0/9 pattern you must match, adjacent to some 5s (the 5s need not fully surround it).\n  - You may leave the level only when your current key EXACTLY matches this lock’s 0/9 distribution.\n* KEY GENERATOR (interactive, how to generate keys):\n  - Look for a patch consisting of 0s and 9s that has a CLEAR path of 3s leading to it and around it, and is NOT bordered by 5s or boxed by 4s.\n  - When any part of your 8×8 player steps ONTO this patch, it GENERATES a NEW candidate key and updates the bottom-left indicator.\n  - Step OFF the patch and then back ON to generate yet another candidate key; repeat to cycle through the set of keys.\n  - Continue cycling until the bottom-left indicator EXACTLY matches the lock pattern at the exit (the same 0/9 layout adjacent to 5s).\n* Locating things quickly:\n  - Generator: 0/9 patch accessible via 3s, with only 3s around it (no 5s), is almost certainly the generator.\n  - Exit: a matching 0/9 pattern near 5s marks the lock/exit area.\n\n# HUD / PROGRESSION\n* Visual score on the second-to-last grid row (row 62): it contains several 4-cell “slots”.\n  - Slots made of 3s represent UNFINISHED levels.\n  - When a slot changes from 3s to another color, that level is COMPLETE.\n* Track remaining MOVES/ENERGY by counting tiles with value 15.\n* Track LIVES by counting distinct 2×2 blocks of 8s.\n\n# GENERAL NOTES\n* The grid is a bird’s-eye view.\n* If the grid does not change after an action, you likely attempted an illegal move into 4s.\n* Favor routes marked by 3s; use the generator (0/9 patch surrounded by 3s) to cycle keys; confirm the match by comparing the bottom-left indicator (boxed by 4s) to the 0/9 lock pattern found near 5s; then proceed to the exit.\n\n# EXAMPLE STRATEGY OBSERVATION\nThe 8×8 player (top rows 12s, bottom rows 9s) is touching 4s on the left, so LEFT is blocked. I see a 0/9 patch with only 3s around it to the right—that’s likely the generator. I should move RIGHT to step on/off it until the bottom-left indicator (boxed by 4s) matches the lock pattern I see near the 5s, then head to the exit.\n\n# TURN:\nCall exactly one action.\n\n"

    "content": "\n# CONTEXT:\nYou are an agent playing a dynamic game. Your objective is to\nWIN and avoid GAME_OVER while minimizing actions.\n\nOne action produces one Frame. One Frame is made of one or more sequential\nGrids. Each Grid is a matrix size INT<0,63> by INT<0,63> filled with\nINT<0,15> values. Each value represents a different color and usually implies a different object.\n\nYou are playing a game called LockSmith.\n\n# CONTROLS\n* RESET: start over\n* ACTION1: move up\n* ACTION2: move down\n* ACTION3: move left\n* ACTION4: move right\n* ACTION5/ACTION6: no-ops\n\n# ORIENTATION (read carefully)\n* The global frame is fixed: the bottom-left KEY INDICATOR is always at the bottom-left; the EXIT/lock is elsewhere.\n* ACTION1 (UP) moves you toward the area where 15s (move counters) are located; use this as a compass for “up.”\n* ACTION4 (RIGHT) increases your distance from the bottom-left key indicator; ACTION3 (LEFT) decreases it.\n* Legality checks with 4s (walls):\n  - RIGHT is ILLEGAL if any 4s lie immediately to the right (“after” in row order) of any 12/9 cells of your 8×8 player.\n  - LEFT is ILLEGAL if any 4s lie immediately to the left (“before” in row order) of any 12/9 cells of your 8×8 player.\n  - UP is ILLEGAL if any 4s lie directly above the topmost 12 row of your player.\n  - DOWN is ILLEGAL if any 4s lie directly below the bottommost 9 row of your player.\n* Always orient carefully before moving: check where the 15s lie (for UP), how far you are from the bottom-left indicator (for LEFT/RIGHT), and whether 4s precede/follow your 12s/9s in the intended direction.\n\n# GOAL\nFind/generate a key that MATCHES the key pattern shown at the EXIT, then navigate to the EXIT to finish the level.\nThere are 6 levels total. Complete all levels to WIN.\n\n# TILE MEANINGS (important ones)\n* 0 = white cell (used in key patterns)\n* 3 = walkable path / corridor marker (often outlines routes to key/exit)\n* 4 = WALL (solid). You cannot enter 4s.\n* 5 = EXIT indicator (presence of 5s marks/frames the exit area)\n* 8 = LIFE token (count lives as the number of 2×2 blocks of 8s)\n* 9 = blue cells (used in player lower body; also appear elsewhere in the map and in key logic)\n* 12 = orange cells (used in player upper body)\n* 15 = MOVE counter (number of 15s ≈ moves/energy left)\n\n# PLAYER (sprite + movement legality)\n* The player is an 8×8 sprite made ONLY of 12s (top two rows) over 9s (bottom six rows).\n  - Concretely: rows 0–1 (relative to the sprite) are all 12s; rows 2–7 are all 9s.\n  - Other scattered 9s on the board are NOT the player—only the exact 8×8 (2×8 of 12s stacked on 6×8 of 9s) is the player.\n* Movement rules:\n  - You may move only through non-4 cells (i.e., never overlap a 4 after a move).\n  - If any part of your 8×8 sprite would overlap a 4 in the target direction (including cases where 4s lie “under” 9s), that move is ILLEGAL.\n  - If your sprite is already touching 4s on a side, you cannot move further in that touching direction until you have clearance.\n  - Practically: navigate corridors “between the 4s”.\n\n# KEYS, EXIT, AND HOW TO FIND THEM\n* Bottom-left KEY INDICATOR (non-interactive):\n  - A small block of 0s and 9s COMPLETELY BOXED by 4s in the bottom-left of the entire grid.\n  - This is NOT reachable and NOT a gameplay area. It only shows your CURRENT selected key.\n* EXIT (the lock to open):\n  - Elsewhere on the map, the lock is the target 0/9 pattern you must match, adjacent to some 5s (the 5s need not fully surround it).\n  - You may leave the level only when your current key EXACTLY matches this lock’s 0/9 distribution.\n* KEY GENERATOR (interactive, how to generate keys):\n  - Look for a patch consisting of 0s and 9s that has a CLEAR path of 3s leading to it and around it, and is NOT bordered by 5s or boxed by 4s.\n  - When any part of your 8×8 player steps ONTO this patch, it GENERATES a NEW candidate key and updates the bottom-left indicator.\n  - Step OFF the patch and then back ON to generate yet another candidate key; repeat to cycle through the set of keys.\n  - Continue cycling until the bottom-left indicator EXACTLY matches the lock pattern at the exit (the same 0/9 layout adjacent to 5s).\n* Locating things quickly:\n  - Generator: 0/9 patch accessible via 3s, with only 3s around it (no 5s), is almost certainly the generator.\n  - Exit: a matching 0/9 pattern near 5s marks the lock/exit area.\n\n# HUD / PROGRESSION\n* Visual score on the second-to-last grid row (row 62): it contains several 4-cell “slots”.\n  - Slots made of 3s represent UNFINISHED levels.\n  - When a slot changes from 3s to another color, that level is COMPLETE.\n* Track remaining MOVES/ENERGY by counting tiles with value 15.\n* Track LIVES by counting distinct 2×2 blocks of 8s.\n\n# GENERAL NOTES\n* The grid is a bird’s-eye view.\n* If the grid does not change after an action, you likely attempted an illegal move into 4s.\n* Favor routes marked by 3s; use the generator (0/9 patch surrounded by 3s) to cycle keys; confirm the match by comparing the bottom-left indicator (boxed by 4s) to the 0/9 lock pattern found near 5s; then proceed to the exit.\n\n# EXAMPLE STRATEGY OBSERVATION\nThe 8×8 player (top rows 12s, bottom rows 9s) is touching 4s on the left, so LEFT is blocked. I see a 0/9 patch with only 3s around it to the right—that’s likely the generator. I should move RIGHT to step on/off it until the bottom-left indicator (boxed by 4s) matches the lock pattern I see near the 5s, then head to the exit.\n\n# TURN:\nCall exactly one action.\n\n"

One Frame is made of one or more sequential\nGrids. Each Grid is a matrix size INT<0,63> by INT<0,63> filled with\nINT<0,15> values. Each value represents a different color and usually implies a different object.\n\nYou are playing a game called LockSmith.\n\n# CONTROLS\n* RESET: start over\n* ACTION1: move up\n* ACTION2: move down\n* ACTION3: move left\n* ACTION4: move right\n* ACTION5/ACTION6: no-ops\n\n# ORIENTATION (read carefully)\n* The global frame is fixed: the bottom-left KEY INDICATOR is always at the bottom-left; the EXIT/lock is elsewhere.\n* ACTION1 (UP) moves you toward the area where 15s (move counters) are located; use this as a compass for “up.”\n* ACTION4 (RIGHT) increases your distance from the bottom-left key indicator; ACTION3 (LEFT) decreases it.\n* Legality checks with 4s (walls):\n  - RIGHT is ILLEGAL if any 4s lie immediately to the right (“after” in row order) of any 12/9 cells of your 8×8 player.\n  - LEFT is ILLEGAL if any 4s lie immediately to the left (“before” in row order) of any 12/9 cells of your 8×8 player.\n  - UP is ILLEGAL if any 4s lie directly above the topmost 12 row of your player.\n  - DOWN is ILLEGAL if any 4s lie directly below the bottommost 9 row of your player.\n* Always orient carefully before moving: check where the 15s lie (for UP), how far you are from the bottom-left indicator (for LEFT/RIGHT), and whether 4s precede/follow your 12s/9s in the intended direction.\n\n# GOAL\nFind/generate a key that MATCHES the key pattern shown at the EXIT, then navigate to the EXIT to finish the level.\nThere are 6 levels total. Complete all levels to WIN.\n\n# TILE MEANINGS (important ones)\n* 0 = white cell (used in key patterns)\n* 3 = walkable path / corridor marker (often outlines routes to key/exit)\n* 4 = WALL (solid). You cannot enter 4s.\n* 5 = EXIT indicator (presence of 5s marks/frames the exit area)\n* 8 = LIFE token (count lives as the number of 2×2 blocks of 8s)\n* 9 = blue cells (used in player lower body; also appear elsewhere in the map and in key logic)\n* 12 = orange cells (used in player upper body)\n* 15 = MOVE counter (number of 15s ≈ moves/energy left)\n\n# PLAYER (sprite + movement legality)\n* The player is an 8×8 sprite made ONLY of 12s (top two rows) over 9s (bottom six rows).\n  - Concretely: rows 0–1 (relative to the sprite) are all 12s; rows 2–7 are all 9s.\n  - Other scattered 9s on the board are NOT the player—only the exact 8×8 (2×8 of 12s stacked on 6×8 of 9s) is the player.\n* Movement rules:\n  - You may move only through non-4 cells (i.e., never overlap a 4 after a move).\n  - If any part of your 8×8 sprite would overlap a 4 in the target direction (including cases where 4s lie “under” 9s), that move is ILLEGAL.\n  - If your sprite is already touching 4s on a side, you cannot move further in that touching direction until you have clearance.\n  - Practically: navigate corridors “between the 4s”.\n\n# KEYS, EXIT, AND HOW TO FIND THEM\n* Bottom-left KEY INDICATOR (non-interactive):\n  - A small block of 0s and 9s COMPLETELY BOXED by 4s in the bottom-left of the entire grid.\n  - This is NOT reachable and NOT a gameplay area. It only shows your CURRENT selected key.\n* EXIT (the lock to open):\n  - Elsewhere on the map, the lock is the target 0/9 pattern you must match, adjacent to some 5s (the 5s need not fully surround it).\n  - You may leave the level only when your current key EXACTLY matches this lock’s 0/9 distribution.\n* KEY GENERATOR (interactive, how to generate keys):\n  - Look for a patch consisting of 0s and 9s that has a CLEAR path of 3s leading to it and around it, and is NOT bordered by 5s or boxed by 4s.\n  - When any part of your 8×8 player steps ONTO this patch, it GENERATES a NEW candidate key and updates the bottom-left indicator.\n  - Step OFF the patch and then back ON to generate yet another candidate key; repeat to cycle through the set of keys.\n  - Continue cycling until the bottom-left indicator EXACTLY matches the lock pattern at the exit (the same 0/9 layout adjacent to 5s).\n* Locating things quickly:\n  - Generator: 0/9 patch accessible via 3s, with only 3s around it (no 5s), is almost certainly the generator.\n  - Exit: a matching 0/9 pattern near 5s marks the lock/exit area.\n\n# HUD / PROGRESSION\n* Visual score on the second-to-last grid row (row 62): it contains several 4-cell “slots”.\n  - Slots made of 3s represent UNFINISHED levels.\n  - When a slot changes from 3s to another color, that level is COMPLETE.\n* Track remaining MOVES/ENERGY by counting tiles with value 15.\n* Track LIVES by counting distinct 2×2 blocks of 8s.\n\n# GENERAL NOTES\n* The grid is a bird’s-eye view.\n* If the grid does not change after an action, you likely attempted an illegal move into 4s.\n* Favor routes marked by 3s; use the generator (0/9 patch surrounded by 3s) to cycle keys; confirm the match by comparing the bottom-left indicator (boxed by 4s) to the 0/9 lock pattern found near 5s; then proceed to the exit.\n\n# EXAMPLE STRATEGY OBSERVATION\nThe 8×8 player (top rows 12s, bottom rows 9s) is touching 4s on the left, so LEFT is blocked. I see a 0/9 patch with only 3s around it to the right—that’s likely the generator. I should move RIGHT to step on/off it until the bottom-left indicator (boxed by 4s) matches the lock pattern I see near the 5s, then head to the exit.\n\n# TURN:\nCall exactly one action.\n\n"

    "content": "\n# CONTEXT:\nYou are an agent playing a dynamic game. Your objective is to\nWIN and avoid GAME_OVER while minimizing actions.\n\nOne action produces one Frame. One Frame is made of one or more sequential\nGrids. Each Grid is a matrix size INT<0,63> by INT<0,63> filled with\nINT<0,15> values. Each value represents a different color and usually implies a different object.\n\nYou are playing a game called LockSmith.\n\n# CONTROLS\n* RESET: start over\n* ACTION1: move up\n* ACTION2: move down\n* ACTION3: move left\n* ACTION4: move right\n* ACTION5/ACTION6: no-ops\n\n# ORIENTATION (read carefully)\n* The global frame is fixed: the bottom-left KEY INDICATOR is always at the bottom-left; the EXIT/lock is elsewhere.\n* ACTION1 (UP) moves you toward the area where 15s (move counters) are located; use this as a compass for “up.”\n* ACTION4 (RIGHT) increases your distance from the bottom-left key indicator; ACTION3 (LEFT) decreases it.\n* Legality checks with 4s (walls):\n  - RIGHT is ILLEGAL if any 4s lie immediately to the right (“after” in row order) of any 12/9 cells of your 8×8 player.\n  - LEFT is ILLEGAL if any 4s lie immediately to the left (“before” in row order) of any 12/9 cells of your 8×8 player.\n  - UP is ILLEGAL if any 4s lie directly above the topmost 12 row of your player.\n  - DOWN is ILLEGAL if any 4s lie directly below the bottommost 9 row of your player.\n* Always orient carefully before moving: check where the 15s lie (for UP), how far you are from the bottom-left indicator (for LEFT/RIGHT), and whether 4s precede/follow your 12s/9s in the intended direction.\n\n# GOAL\nFind/generate a key that MATCHES the key pattern shown at the EXIT, then navigate to the EXIT to finish the level.\nThere are 6 levels total. Complete all levels to WIN.\n\n# TILE MEANINGS (important ones)\n* 0 = white cell (used in key patterns)\n* 3 = walkable path / corridor marker (often outlines routes to key/exit)\n* 4 = WALL (solid). You cannot enter 4s.\n* 5 = EXIT indicator (presence of 5s marks/frames the exit area)\n* 8 = LIFE token (count lives as the number of 2×2 blocks of 8s)\n* 9 = blue cells (used in player lower body; also appear elsewhere in the map and in key logic)\n* 12 = orange cells (used in player upper body)\n* 15 = MOVE counter (number of 15s ≈ moves/energy left)\n\n# PLAYER (sprite + movement legality)\n* The player is an 8×8 sprite made ONLY of 12s (top two rows) over 9s (bottom six rows).\n  - Concretely: rows 0–1 (relative to the sprite) are all 12s; rows 2–7 are all 9s.\n  - Other scattered 9s on the board are NOT the player—only the exact 8×8 (2×8 of 12s stacked on 6×8 of 9s) is the player.\n* Movement rules:\n  - You may move only through non-4 cells (i.e., never overlap a 4 after a move).\n  - If any part of your 8×8 sprite would overlap a 4 in the target direction (including cases where 4s lie “under” 9s), that move is ILLEGAL.\n  - If your sprite is already touching 4s on a side, you cannot move further in that touching direction until you have clearance.\n  - Practically: navigate corridors “between the 4s”.\n\n# KEYS, EXIT, AND HOW TO FIND THEM\n* Bottom-left KEY INDICATOR (non-interactive):\n  - A small block of 0s and 9s COMPLETELY BOXED by 4s in the bottom-left of the entire grid.\n  - This is NOT reachable and NOT a gameplay area. It only shows your CURRENT selected key.\n* EXIT (the lock to open):\n  - Elsewhere on the map, the lock is the target 0/9 pattern you must match, adjacent to some 5s (the 5s need not fully surround it).\n  - You may leave the level only when your current key EXACTLY matches this lock’s 0/9 distribution.\n* KEY GENERATOR (interactive, how to generate keys):\n  - Look for a patch consisting of 0s and 9s that has a CLEAR path of 3s leading to it and around it, and is NOT bordered by 5s or boxed by 4s.\n  - When any part of your 8×8 player steps ONTO this patch, it GENERATES a NEW candidate key and updates the bottom-left indicator.\n  - Step OFF the patch and then back ON to generate yet another candidate key; repeat to cycle through the set of keys.\n  - Continue cycling until the bottom-left indicator EXACTLY matches the lock pattern at the exit (the same 0/9 layout adjacent to 5s).\n* Locating things quickly:\n  - Generator: 0/9 patch accessible via 3s, with only 3s around it (no 5s), is almost certainly the generator.\n  - Exit: a matching 0/9 pattern near 5s marks the lock/exit area.\n\n# HUD / PROGRESSION\n* Visual score on the second-to-last grid row (row 62): it contains several 4-cell “slots”.\n  - Slots made of 3s represent UNFINISHED levels.\n  - When a slot changes from 3s to another color, that level is COMPLETE.\n* Track remaining MOVES/ENERGY by counting tiles with value 15.\n* Track LIVES by counting distinct 2×2 blocks of 8s.\n\n# GENERAL NOTES\n* The grid is a bird’s-eye view.\n* If the grid does not change after an action, you likely attempted an illegal move into 4s.\n* Favor routes marked by 3s; use the generator (0/9 patch surrounded by 3s) to cycle keys; confirm the match by comparing the bottom-left indicator (boxed by 4s) to the 0/9 lock pattern found near 5s; then proceed to the exit.\n\n# EXAMPLE STRATEGY OBSERVATION\nThe 8×8 player (top rows 12s, bottom rows 9s) is touching 4s on the left, so LEFT is blocked. I see a 0/9 patch with only 3s around it to the right—that’s likely the generator. I should move RIGHT to step on/off it until the bottom-left indicator (boxed by 4s) matches the lock pattern I see near the 5s, then head to the exit.\n\n# TURN:\nCall exactly one action.\n\n"

    "content": "\n# CONTEXT:\nYou are an agent playing a dynamic game. Your objective is to\nWIN and avoid GAME_OVER while minimizing actions.\n\nOne action produces one Frame. One Frame is made of one or more sequential\nGrids. Each Grid is a matrix size INT<0,63> by INT<0,63> filled with\nINT<0,15> values. Each value represents a different color and usually implies a different object.\n\nYou are playing a game called LockSmith.\n\n# CONTROLS\n* RESET: start over\n* ACTION1: move up\n* ACTION2: move down\n* ACTION3: move left\n* ACTION4: move right\n* ACTION5/ACTION6: no-ops\n\n# ORIENTATION (read carefully)\n* The global frame is fixed: the bottom-left KEY INDICATOR is always at the bottom-left; the EXIT/lock is elsewhere.\n* ACTION1 (UP) moves you toward the area where 15s (move counters) are located; use this as a compass for “up.”\n* ACTION4 (RIGHT) increases your distance from the bottom-left key indicator; ACTION3 (LEFT) decreases it.\n* Legality checks with 4s (walls):\n  - RIGHT is ILLEGAL if any 4s lie immediately to the right (“after” in row order) of any 12/9 cells of your 8×8 player.\n  - LEFT is ILLEGAL if any 4s lie immediately to the left (“before” in row order) of any 12/9 cells of your 8×8 player.\n  - UP is ILLEGAL if any 4s lie directly above the topmost 12 row of your player.\n  - DOWN is ILLEGAL if any 4s lie directly below the bottommost 9 row of your player.\n* Always orient carefully before moving: check where the 15s lie (for UP), how far you are from the bottom-left indicator (for LEFT/RIGHT), and whether 4s precede/follow your 12s/9s in the intended direction.\n\n# GOAL\nFind/generate a key that MATCHES the key pattern shown at the EXIT, then navigate to the EXIT to finish the level.\nThere are 6 levels total. Complete all levels to WIN.\n\n# TILE MEANINGS (important ones)\n* 0 = white cell (used in key patterns)\n* 3 = walkable path / corridor marker (often outlines routes to key/exit)\n* 4 = WALL (solid). You cannot enter 4s.\n* 5 = EXIT indicator (presence of 5s marks/frames the exit area)\n* 8 = LIFE token (count lives as the number of 2×2 blocks of 8s)\n* 9 = blue cells (used in player lower body; also appear elsewhere in the map and in key logic)\n* 12 = orange cells (used in player upper body)\n* 15 = MOVE counter (number of 15s ≈ moves/energy left)\n\n# PLAYER (sprite + movement legality)\n* The player is an 8×8 sprite made ONLY of 12s (top two rows) over 9s (bottom six rows).\n  - Concretely: rows 0–1 (relative to the sprite) are all 12s; rows 2–7 are all 9s.\n  - Other scattered 9s on the board are NOT the player—only the exact 8×8 (2×8 of 12s stacked on 6×8 of 9s) is the player.\n* Movement rules:\n  - You may move only through non-4 cells (i.e., never overlap a 4 after a move).\n  - If any part of your 8×8 sprite would overlap a 4 in the target direction (including cases where 4s lie “under” 9s), that move is ILLEGAL.\n  - If your sprite is already touching 4s on a side, you cannot move further in that touching direction until you have clearance.\n  - Practically: navigate corridors “between the 4s”.\n\n# KEYS, EXIT, AND HOW TO FIND THEM\n* Bottom-left KEY INDICATOR (non-interactive):\n  - A small block of 0s and 9s COMPLETELY BOXED by 4s in the bottom-left of the entire grid.\n  - This is NOT reachable and NOT a gameplay area. It only shows your CURRENT selected key.\n* EXIT (the lock to open):\n  - Elsewhere on the map, the lock is the target 0/9 pattern you must match, adjacent to some 5s (the 5s need not fully surround it).\n  - You may leave the level only when your current key EXACTLY matches this lock’s 0/9 distribution.\n* KEY GENERATOR (interactive, how to generate keys):\n  - Look for a patch consisting of 0s and 9s that has a CLEAR path of 3s leading to it and around it, and is NOT bordered by 5s or boxed by 4s.\n  - When any part of your 8×8 player steps ONTO this patch, it GENERATES a NEW candidate key and updates the bottom-left indicator.\n  - Step OFF the patch and then back ON to generate yet another candidate key; repeat to cycle through the set of keys.\n  - Continue cycling until the bottom-left indicator EXACTLY matches the lock pattern at the exit (the same 0/9 layout adjacent to 5s).\n* Locating things quickly:\n  - Generator: 0/9 patch accessible via 3s, with only 3s around it (no 5s), is almost certainly the generator.\n  - Exit: a matching 0/9 pattern near 5s marks the lock/exit area.\n\n# HUD / PROGRESSION\n* Visual score on the second-to-last grid row (row 62): it contains several 4-cell “slots”.\n  - Slots made of 3s represent UNFINISHED levels.\n  - When a slot changes from 3s to another color, that level is COMPLETE.\n* Track remaining MOVES/ENERGY by counting tiles with value 15.\n* Track LIVES by counting distinct 2×2 blocks of 8s.\n\n# GENERAL NOTES\n* The grid is a bird’s-eye view.\n* If the grid does not change after an action, you likely attempted an illegal move into 4s.\n* Favor routes marked by 3s; use the generator (0/9 patch surrounded by 3s) to cycle keys; confirm the match by comparing the bottom-left indicator (boxed by 4s) to the 0/9 lock pattern found near 5s; then proceed to the exit.\n\n# EXAMPLE STRATEGY OBSERVATION\nThe 8×8 player (top rows 12s, bottom rows 9s) is touching 4s on the left, so LEFT is blocked. I see a 0/9 patch with only 3s around it to the right—that’s likely the generator. I should move RIGHT to step on/off it until the bottom-left indicator (boxed by 4s) matches the lock pattern I see near the 5s, then head to the exit.\n\n# TURN:\nCall exactly one action.\n\n"

    "content": "\n# CONTEXT:\nYou are an agent playing a dynamic game. Your objective is to\nWIN and avoid GAME_OVER while minimizing actions.\n\nOne action produces one Frame. One Frame is made of one or more sequential\nGrids. Each Grid is a matrix size INT<0,63> by INT<0,63> filled with\nINT<0,15> values. Each value represents a different color and usually implies a different object.\n\nYou are playing a game called LockSmith.\n\n# CONTROLS\n* RESET: start over\n* ACTION1: move up\n* ACTION2: move down\n* ACTION3: move left\n* ACTION4: move right\n* ACTION5/ACTION6: no-ops\n\n# ORIENTATION (read carefully)\n* The global frame is fixed: the bottom-left KEY INDICATOR is always at the bottom-left; the EXIT/lock is elsewhere.\n* ACTION1 (UP) moves you toward the area where 15s (move counters) are located; use this as a compass for “up.”\n* ACTION4 (RIGHT) increases your distance from the bottom-left key indicator; ACTION3 (LEFT) decreases it.\n* Legality checks with 4s (walls):\n  - RIGHT is ILLEGAL if any 4s lie immediately to the right (“after” in row order) of any 12/9 cells of your 8×8 player.\n  - LEFT is ILLEGAL if any 4s lie immediately to the left (“before” in row order) of any 12/9 cells of your 8×8 player.\n  - UP is ILLEGAL if any 4s lie directly above the topmost 12 row of your player.\n  - DOWN is ILLEGAL if any 4s lie directly below the bottommost 9 row of your player.\n* Always orient carefully before moving: check where the 15s lie (for UP), how far you are from the bottom-left indicator (for LEFT/RIGHT), and whether 4s precede/follow your 12s/9s in the intended direction.\n\n# GOAL\nFind/generate a key that MATCHES the key pattern shown at the EXIT, then navigate to the EXIT to finish the level.\nThere are 6 levels total. Complete all levels to WIN.\n\n# TILE MEANINGS (important ones)\n* 0 = white cell (used in key patterns)\n* 3 = walkable path / corridor marker (often outlines routes to key/exit)\n* 4 = WALL (solid). You cannot enter 4s.\n* 5 = EXIT indicator (presence of 5s marks/frames the exit area)\n* 8 = LIFE token (count lives as the number of 2×2 blocks of 8s)\n* 9 = blue cells (used in player lower body; also appear elsewhere in the map and in key logic)\n* 12 = orange cells (used in player upper body)\n* 15 = MOVE counter (number of 15s ≈ moves/energy left)\n\n# PLAYER (sprite + movement legality)\n* The player is an 8×8 sprite made ONLY of 12s (top two rows) over 9s (bottom six rows).\n  - Concretely: rows 0–1 (relative to the sprite) are all 12s; rows 2–7 are all 9s.\n  - Other scattered 9s on the board are NOT the player—only the exact 8×8 (2×8 of 12s stacked on 6×8 of 9s) is the player.\n* Movement rules:\n  - You may move only through non-4 cells (i.e., never overlap a 4 after a move).\n  - If any part of your 8×8 sprite would overlap a 4 in the target direction (including cases where 4s lie “under” 9s), that move is ILLEGAL.\n  - If your sprite is already touching 4s on a side, you cannot move further in that touching direction until you have clearance.\n  - Practically: navigate corridors “between the 4s”.\n\n# KEYS, EXIT, AND HOW TO FIND THEM\n* Bottom-left KEY INDICATOR (non-interactive):\n  - A small block of 0s and 9s COMPLETELY BOXED by 4s in the bottom-left of the entire grid.\n  - This is NOT reachable and NOT a gameplay area. It only shows your CURRENT selected key.\n* EXIT (the lock to open):\n  - Elsewhere on the map, the lock is the target 0/9 pattern you must match, adjacent to some 5s (the 5s need not fully surround it).\n  - You may leave the level only when your current key EXACTLY matches this lock’s 0/9 distribution.\n* KEY GENERATOR (interactive, how to generate keys):\n  - Look for a patch consisting of 0s and 9s that has a CLEAR path of 3s leading to it and around it, and is NOT bordered by 5s or boxed by 4s.\n  - When any part of your 8×8 player steps ONTO this patch, it GENERATES a NEW candidate key and updates the bottom-left indicator.\n  - Step OFF the patch and then back ON to generate yet another candidate key; repeat to cycle through the set of keys.\n  - Continue cycling until the bottom-left indicator EXACTLY matches the lock pattern at the exit (the same 0/9 layout adjacent to 5s).\n* Locating things quickly:\n  - Generator: 0/9 patch accessible via 3s, with only 3s around it (no 5s), is almost certainly the generator.\n  - Exit: a matching 0/9 pattern near 5s marks the lock/exit area.\n\n# HUD / PROGRESSION\n* Visual score on the second-to-last grid row (row 62): it contains several 4-cell “slots”.\n  - Slots made of 3s represent UNFINISHED levels.\n  - When a slot changes from 3s to another color, that level is COMPLETE.\n* Track remaining MOVES/ENERGY by counting tiles with value 15.\n* Track LIVES by counting distinct 2×2 blocks of 8s.\n\n# GENERAL NOTES\n* The grid is a bird’s-eye view.\n* If the grid does not change after an action, you likely attempted an illegal move into 4s.\n* Favor routes marked by 3s; use the generator (0/9 patch surrounded by 3s) to cycle keys; confirm the match by comparing the bottom-left indicator (boxed by 4s) to the 0/9 lock pattern found near 5s; then proceed to the exit.\n\n# EXAMPLE STRATEGY OBSERVATION\nThe 8×8 player (top rows 12s, bottom rows 9s) is touching 4s on the left, so LEFT is blocked. I see a 0/9 patch with only 3s around it to the right—that’s likely the generator. I should move RIGHT to step on/off it until the bottom-left indicator (boxed by 4s) matches the lock pattern I see near the 5s, then head to the exit.\n\n# TURN:\nCall exactly one action.\n\n"

    "content": "\n# CONTEXT:\nYou are an agent playing a dynamic game. Your objective is to\nWIN and avoid GAME_OVER while minimizing actions.\n\nOne action produces one Frame. One Frame is made of one or more sequential\nGrids. Each Grid is a matrix size INT<0,63> by INT<0,63> filled with\nINT<0,15> values. Each value represents a different color and usually implies a different object.\n\nYou are playing a game called LockSmith.\n\n# CONTROLS\n* RESET: start over\n* ACTION1: move up\n* ACTION2: move down\n* ACTION3: move left\n* ACTION4: move right\n* ACTION5/ACTION6: no-ops\n\n# ORIENTATION (read carefully)\n* The global frame is fixed: the bottom-left KEY INDICATOR is always at the bottom-left; the EXIT/lock is elsewhere.\n* ACTION1 (UP) moves you toward the area where 15s (move counters) are located; use this as a compass for “up.”\n* ACTION4 (RIGHT) increases your distance from the bottom-left key indicator; ACTION3 (LEFT) decreases it.\n* Legality checks with 4s (walls):\n  - RIGHT is ILLEGAL if any 4s lie immediately to the right (“after” in row order) of any 12/9 cells of your 8×8 player.\n  - LEFT is ILLEGAL if any 4s lie immediately to the left (“before” in row order) of any 12/9 cells of your 8×8 player.\n  - UP is ILLEGAL if any 4s lie directly above the topmost 12 row of your player.\n  - DOWN is ILLEGAL if any 4s lie directly below the bottommost 9 row of your player.\n* Always orient carefully before moving: check where the 15s lie (for UP), how far you are from the bottom-left indicator (for LEFT/RIGHT), and whether 4s precede/follow your 12s/9s in the intended direction.\n\n# GOAL\nFind/generate a key that MATCHES the key pattern shown at the EXIT, then navigate to the EXIT to finish the level.\nThere are 6 levels total. Complete all levels to WIN.\n\n# TILE MEANINGS (important ones)\n* 0 = white cell (used in key patterns)\n* 3 = walkable path / corridor marker (often outlines routes to key/exit)\n* 4 = WALL (solid). You cannot enter 4s.\n* 5 = EXIT indicator (presence of 5s marks/frames the exit area)\n* 8 = LIFE token (count lives as the number of 2×2 blocks of 8s)\n* 9 = blue cells (used in player lower body; also appear elsewhere in the map and in key logic)\n* 12 = orange cells (used in player upper body)\n* 15 = MOVE counter (number of 15s ≈ moves/energy left)\n\n# PLAYER (sprite + movement legality)\n* The player is an 8×8 sprite made ONLY of 12s (top two rows) over 9s (bottom six rows).\n  - Concretely: rows 0–1 (relative to the sprite) are all 12s; rows 2–7 are all 9s.\n  - Other scattered 9s on the board are NOT the player—only the exact 8×8 (2×8 of 12s stacked on 6×8 of 9s) is the player.\n* Movement rules:\n  - You may move only through non-4 cells (i.e., never overlap a 4 after a move).\n  - If any part of your 8×8 sprite would overlap a 4 in the target direction (including cases where 4s lie “under” 9s), that move is ILLEGAL.\n  - If your sprite is already touching 4s on a side, you cannot move further in that touching direction until you have clearance.\n  - Practically: navigate corridors “between the 4s”.\n\n# KEYS, EXIT, AND HOW TO FIND THEM\n* Bottom-left KEY INDICATOR (non-interactive):\n  - A small block of 0s and 9s COMPLETELY BOXED by 4s in the bottom-left of the entire grid.\n  - This is NOT reachable and NOT a gameplay area. It only shows your CURRENT selected key.\n* EXIT (the lock to open):\n  - Elsewhere on the map, the lock is the target 0/9 pattern you must match, adjacent to some 5s (the 5s need not fully surround it).\n  - You may leave the level only when your current key EXACTLY matches this lock’s 0/9 distribution.\n* KEY GENERATOR (interactive, how to generate keys):\n  - Look for a patch consisting of 0s and 9s that has a CLEAR path of 3s leading to it and around it, and is NOT bordered by 5s or boxed by 4s.\n  - When any part of your 8×8 player steps ONTO this patch, it GENERATES a NEW candidate key and updates the bottom-left indicator.\n  - Step OFF the patch and then back ON to generate yet another candidate key; repeat to cycle through the set of keys.\n  - Continue cycling until the bottom-left indicator EXACTLY matches the lock pattern at the exit (the same 0/9 layout adjacent to 5s).\n* Locating things quickly:\n  - Generator: 0/9 patch accessible via 3s, with only 3s around it (no 5s), is almost certainly the generator.\n  - Exit: a matching 0/9 pattern near 5s marks the lock/exit area.\n\n# HUD / PROGRESSION\n* Visual score on the second-to-last grid row (row 62): it contains several 4-cell “slots”.\n  - Slots made of 3s represent UNFINISHED levels.\n  - When a slot changes from 3s to another color, that level is COMPLETE.\n* Track remaining MOVES/ENERGY by counting tiles with value 15.\n* Track LIVES by counting distinct 2×2 blocks of 8s.\n\n# GENERAL NOTES\n* The grid is a bird’s-eye view.\n* If the grid does not change after an action, you likely attempted an illegal move into 4s.\n* Favor routes marked by 3s; use the generator (0/9 patch surrounded by 3s) to cycle keys; confirm the match by comparing the bottom-left indicator (boxed by 4s) to the 0/9 lock pattern found near 5s; then proceed to the exit.\n\n# EXAMPLE STRATEGY OBSERVATION\nThe 8×8 player (top rows 12s, bottom rows 9s) is touching 4s on the left, so LEFT is blocked. I see a 0/9 patch with only 3s around it to the right—that’s likely the generator. I should move RIGHT to step on/off it until the bottom-left indicator (boxed by 4s) matches the lock pattern I see near the 5s, then head to the exit.\n\n# TURN:\nCall exactly one action.\n\n"

    "content": "\n# CONTEXT:\nYou are an agent playing a dynamic game. Your objective is to\nWIN and avoid GAME_OVER while minimizing actions.\n\nOne action produces one Frame. One Frame is made of one or more sequential\nGrids. Each Grid is a matrix size INT<0,63> by INT<0,63> filled with\nINT<0,15> values. Each value represents a different color and usually implies a different object.\n\nYou are playing a game called LockSmith.\n\n# CONTROLS\n* RESET: start over\n* ACTION1: move up\n* ACTION2: move down\n* ACTION3: move left\n* ACTION4: move right\n* ACTION5/ACTION6: no-ops\n\n# ORIENTATION (read carefully)\n* The global frame is fixed: the bottom-left KEY INDICATOR is always at the bottom-left; the EXIT/lock is elsewhere.\n* ACTION1 (UP) moves you toward the area where 15s (move counters) are located; use this as a compass for “up.”\n* ACTION4 (RIGHT) increases your distance from the bottom-left key indicator; ACTION3 (LEFT) decreases it.\n* Legality checks with 4s (walls):\n  - RIGHT is ILLEGAL if any 4s lie immediately to the right (“after” in row order) of any 12/9 cells of your 8×8 player.\n  - LEFT is ILLEGAL if any 4s lie immediately to the left (“before” in row order) of any 12/9 cells of your 8×8 player.\n  - UP is ILLEGAL if any 4s lie directly above the topmost 12 row of your player.\n  - DOWN is ILLEGAL if any 4s lie directly below the bottommost 9 row of your player.\n* Always orient carefully before moving: check where the 15s lie (for UP), how far you are from the bottom-left indicator (for LEFT/RIGHT), and whether 4s precede/follow your 12s/9s in the intended direction.\n\n# GOAL\nFind/generate a key that MATCHES the key pattern shown at the EXIT, then navigate to the EXIT to finish the level.\nThere are 6 levels total. Complete all levels to WIN.\n\n# TILE MEANINGS (important ones)\n* 0 = white cell (used in key patterns)\n* 3 = walkable path / corridor marker (often outlines routes to key/exit)\n* 4 = WALL (solid). You cannot enter 4s.\n* 5 = EXIT indicator (presence of 5s marks/frames the exit area)\n* 8 = LIFE token (count lives as the number of 2×2 blocks of 8s)\n* 9 = blue cells (used in player lower body; also appear elsewhere in the map and in key logic)\n* 12 = orange cells (used in player upper body)\n* 15 = MOVE counter (number of 15s ≈ moves/energy left)\n\n# PLAYER (sprite + movement legality)\n* The player is an 8×8 sprite made ONLY of 12s (top two rows) over 9s (bottom six rows).\n  - Concretely: rows 0–1 (relative to the sprite) are all 12s; rows 2–7 are all 9s.\n  - Other scattered 9s on the board are NOT the player—only the exact 8×8 (2×8 of 12s stacked on 6×8 of 9s) is the player.\n* Movement rules:\n  - You may move only through non-4 cells (i.e., never overlap a 4 after a move).\n  - If any part of your 8×8 sprite would overlap a 4 in the target direction (including cases where 4s lie “under” 9s), that move is ILLEGAL.\n  - If your sprite is already touching 4s on a side, you cannot move further in that touching direction until you have clearance.\n  - Practically: navigate corridors “between the 4s”.\n\n# KEYS, EXIT, AND HOW TO FIND THEM\n* Bottom-left KEY INDICATOR (non-interactive):\n  - A small block of 0s and 9s COMPLETELY BOXED by 4s in the bottom-left of the entire grid.\n  - This is NOT reachable and NOT a gameplay area. It only shows your CURRENT selected key.\n* EXIT (the lock to open):\n  - Elsewhere on the map, the lock is the target 0/9 pattern you must match, adjacent to some 5s (the 5s need not fully surround it).\n  - You may leave the level only when your current key EXACTLY matches this lock’s 0/9 distribution.\n* KEY GENERATOR (interactive, how to generate keys):\n  - Look for a patch consisting of 0s and 9s that has a CLEAR path of 3s leading to it and around it, and is NOT bordered by 5s or boxed by 4s.\n  - When any part of your 8×8 player steps ONTO this patch, it GENERATES a NEW candidate key and updates the bottom-left indicator.\n  - Step OFF the patch and then back ON to generate yet another candidate key; repeat to cycle through the set of keys.\n  - Continue cycling until the bottom-left indicator EXACTLY matches the lock pattern at the exit (the same 0/9 layout adjacent to 5s).\n* Locating things quickly:\n  - Generator: 0/9 patch accessible via 3s, with only 3s around it (no 5s), is almost certainly the generator.\n  - Exit: a matching 0/9 pattern near 5s marks the lock/exit area.\n\n# HUD / PROGRESSION\n* Visual score on the second-to-last grid row (row 62): it contains several 4-cell “slots”.\n  - Slots made of 3s represent UNFINISHED levels.\n  - When a slot changes from 3s to another color, that level is COMPLETE.\n* Track remaining MOVES/ENERGY by counting tiles with value 15.\n* Track LIVES by counting distinct 2×2 blocks of 8s.\n\n# GENERAL NOTES\n* The grid is a bird’s-eye view.\n* If the grid does not change after an action, you likely attempted an illegal move into 4s.\n* Favor routes marked by 3s; use the generator (0/9 patch surrounded by 3s) to cycle keys; confirm the match by comparing the bottom-left indicator (boxed by 4s) to the 0/9 lock pattern found near 5s; then proceed to the exit.\n\n# EXAMPLE STRATEGY OBSERVATION\nThe 8×8 player (top rows 12s, bottom rows 9s) is touching 4s on the left, so LEFT is blocked. I see a 0/9 patch with only 3s around it to the right—that’s likely the generator. I should move RIGHT to step on/off it until the bottom-left indicator (boxed by 4s) matches the lock pattern I see near the 5s, then head to the exit.\n\n# TURN:\nCall exactly one action.\n\n"

    "content": "\n# CONTEXT:\nYou are an agent playing a dynamic game. Your objective is to\nWIN and avoid GAME_OVER while minimizing actions.\n\nOne action produces one Frame. One Frame is made of one or more sequential\nGrids. Each Grid is a matrix size INT<0,63> by INT<0,63> filled with\nINT<0,15> values. Each value represents a different color and usually implies a different object.\n\nYou are playing a game called LockSmith.\n\n# CONTROLS\n* RESET: start over\n* ACTION1: move up\n* ACTION2: move down\n* ACTION3: move left\n* ACTION4: move right\n* ACTION5/ACTION6: no-ops\n\n# ORIENTATION (read carefully)\n* The global frame is fixed: the bottom-left KEY INDICATOR is always at the bottom-left; the EXIT/lock is elsewhere.\n* ACTION1 (UP) moves you toward the area where 15s (move counters) are located; use this as a compass for “up.”\n* ACTION4 (RIGHT) increases your distance from the bottom-left key indicator; ACTION3 (LEFT) decreases it.\n* Legality checks with 4s (walls):\n  - RIGHT is ILLEGAL if any 4s lie immediately to the right (“after” in row order) of any 12/9 cells of your 8×8 player.\n  - LEFT is ILLEGAL if any 4s lie immediately to the left (“before” in row order) of any 12/9 cells of your 8×8 player.\n  - UP is ILLEGAL if any 4s lie directly above the topmost 12 row of your player.\n  - DOWN is ILLEGAL if any 4s lie directly below the bottommost 9 row of your player.\n* Always orient carefully before moving: check where the 15s lie (for UP), how far you are from the bottom-left indicator (for LEFT/RIGHT), and whether 4s precede/follow your 12s/9s in the intended direction.\n\n# GOAL\nFind/generate a key that MATCHES the key pattern shown at the EXIT, then navigate to the EXIT to finish the level.\nThere are 6 levels total. Complete all levels to WIN.\n\n# TILE MEANINGS (important ones)\n* 0 = white cell (used in key patterns)\n* 3 = walkable path / corridor marker (often outlines routes to key/exit)\n* 4 = WALL (solid). You cannot enter 4s.\n* 5 = EXIT indicator (presence of 5s marks/frames the exit area)\n* 8 = LIFE token (count lives as the number of 2×2 blocks of 8s)\n* 9 = blue cells (used in player lower body; also appear elsewhere in the map and in key logic)\n* 12 = orange cells (used in player upper body)\n* 15 = MOVE counter (number of 15s ≈ moves/energy left)\n\n# PLAYER (sprite + movement legality)\n* The player is an 8×8 sprite made ONLY of 12s (top two rows) over 9s (bottom six rows).\n  - Concretely: rows 0–1 (relative to the sprite) are all 12s; rows 2–7 are all 9s.\n  - Other scattered 9s on the board are NOT the player—only the exact 8×8 (2×8 of 12s stacked on 6×8 of 9s) is the player.\n* Movement rules:\n  - You may move only through non-4 cells (i.e., never overlap a 4 after a move).\n  - If any part of your 8×8 sprite would overlap a 4 in the target direction (including cases where 4s lie “under” 9s), that move is ILLEGAL.\n  - If your sprite is already touching 4s on a side, you cannot move further in that touching direction until you have clearance.\n  - Practically: navigate corridors “between the 4s”.\n\n# KEYS, EXIT, AND HOW TO FIND THEM\n* Bottom-left KEY INDICATOR (non-interactive):\n  - A small block of 0s and 9s COMPLETELY BOXED by 4s in the bottom-left of the entire grid.\n  - This is NOT reachable and NOT a gameplay area. It only shows your CURRENT selected key.\n* EXIT (the lock to open):\n  - Elsewhere on the map, the lock is the target 0/9 pattern you must match, adjacent to some 5s (the 5s need not fully surround it).\n  - You may leave the level only when your current key EXACTLY matches this lock’s 0/9 distribution.\n* KEY GENERATOR (interactive, how to generate keys):\n  - Look for a patch consisting of 0s and 9s that has a CLEAR path of 3s leading to it and around it, and is NOT bordered by 5s or boxed by 4s.\n  - When any part of your 8×8 player steps ONTO this patch, it GENERATES a NEW candidate key and updates the bottom-left indicator.\n  - Step OFF the patch and then back ON to generate yet another candidate key; repeat to cycle through the set of keys.\n  - Continue cycling until the bottom-left indicator EXACTLY matches the lock pattern at the exit (the same 0/9 layout adjacent to 5s).\n* Locating things quickly:\n  - Generator: 0/9 patch accessible via 3s, with only 3s around it (no 5s), is almost certainly the generator.\n  - Exit: a matching 0/9 pattern near 5s marks the lock/exit area.\n\n# HUD / PROGRESSION\n* Visual score on the second-to-last grid row (row 62): it contains several 4-cell “slots”.\n  - Slots made of 3s represent UNFINISHED levels.\n  - When a slot changes from 3s to another color, that level is COMPLETE.\n* Track remaining MOVES/ENERGY by counting tiles with value 15.\n* Track LIVES by counting distinct 2×2 blocks of 8s.\n\n# GENERAL NOTES\n* The grid is a bird’s-eye view.\n* If the grid does not change after an action, you likely attempted an illegal move into 4s.\n* Favor routes marked by 3s; use the generator (0/9 patch surrounded by 3s) to cycle keys; confirm the match by comparing the bottom-left indicator (boxed by 4s) to the 0/9 lock pattern found near 5s; then proceed to the exit.\n\n# EXAMPLE STRATEGY OBSERVATION\nThe 8×8 player (top rows 12s, bottom rows 9s) is touching 4s on the left, so LEFT is blocked. I see a 0/9 patch with only 3s around it to the right—that’s likely the generator. I should move RIGHT to step on/off it until the bottom-left indicator (boxed by 4s) matches the lock pattern I see near the 5s, then head to the exit.\n\n# TURN:\nCall exactly one action.\n\n"

    "content": "\n# CONTEXT:\nYou are an agent playing a dynamic game. Your objective is to\nWIN and avoid GAME_OVER while minimizing actions.\n\nOne action produces one Frame. One Frame is made of one or more sequential\nGrids. Each Grid is a matrix size INT<0,63> by INT<0,63> filled with\nINT<0,15> values. Each value represents a different color and usually implies a different object.\n\nYou are playing a game called LockSmith.\n\n# CONTROLS\n* RESET: start over\n* ACTION1: move up\n* ACTION2: move down\n* ACTION3: move left\n* ACTION4: move right\n* ACTION5/ACTION6: no-ops\n\n# ORIENTATION (read carefully)\n* The global frame is fixed: the bottom-left KEY INDICATOR is always at the bottom-left; the EXIT/lock is elsewhere.\n* ACTION1 (UP) moves you toward the area where 15s (move counters) are located; use this as a compass for “up.”\n* ACTION4 (RIGHT) increases your distance from the bottom-left key indicator; ACTION3 (LEFT) decreases it.\n* Legality checks with 4s (walls):\n  - RIGHT is ILLEGAL if any 4s lie immediately to the right (“after” in row order) of any 12/9 cells of your 8×8 player.\n  - LEFT is ILLEGAL if any 4s lie immediately to the left (“before” in row order) of any 12/9 cells of your 8×8 player.\n  - UP is ILLEGAL if any 4s lie directly above the topmost 12 row of your player.\n  - DOWN is ILLEGAL if any 4s lie directly below the bottommost 9 row of your player.\n* Always orient carefully before moving: check where the 15s lie (for UP), how far you are from the bottom-left indicator (for LEFT/RIGHT), and whether 4s precede/follow your 12s/9s in the intended direction.\n\n# GOAL\nFind/generate a key that MATCHES the key pattern shown at the EXIT, then navigate to the EXIT to finish the level.\nThere are 6 levels total. Complete all levels to WIN.\n\n# TILE MEANINGS (important ones)\n* 0 = white cell (used in key patterns)\n* 3 = walkable path / corridor marker (often outlines routes to key/exit)\n* 4 = WALL (solid). You cannot enter 4s.\n* 5 = EXIT indicator (presence of 5s marks/frames the exit area)\n* 8 = LIFE token (count lives as the number of 2×2 blocks of 8s)\n* 9 = blue cells (used in player lower body; also appear elsewhere in the map and in key logic)\n* 12 = orange cells (used in player upper body)\n* 15 = MOVE counter (number of 15s ≈ moves/energy left)\n\n# PLAYER (sprite + movement legality)\n* The player is an 8×8 sprite made ONLY of 12s (top two rows) over 9s (bottom six rows).\n  - Concretely: rows 0–1 (relative to the sprite) are all 12s; rows 2–7 are all 9s.\n  - Other scattered 9s on the board are NOT the player—only the exact 8×8 (2×8 of 12s stacked on 6×8 of 9s) is the player.\n* Movement rules:\n  - You may move only through non-4 cells (i.e., never overlap a 4 after a move).\n  - If any part of your 8×8 sprite would overlap a 4 in the target direction (including cases where 4s lie “under” 9s), that move is ILLEGAL.\n  - If your sprite is already touching 4s on a side, you cannot move further in that touching direction until you have clearance.\n  - Practically: navigate corridors “between the 4s”.\n\n# KEYS, EXIT, AND HOW TO FIND THEM\n* Bottom-left KEY INDICATOR (non-interactive):\n  - A small block of 0s and 9s COMPLETELY BOXED by 4s in the bottom-left of the entire grid.\n  - This is NOT reachable and NOT a gameplay area. It only shows your CURRENT selected key.\n* EXIT (the lock to open):\n  - Elsewhere on the map, the lock is the target 0/9 pattern you must match, adjacent to some 5s (the 5s need not fully surround it).\n  - You may leave the level only when your current key EXACTLY matches this lock’s 0/9 distribution.\n* KEY GENERATOR (interactive, how to generate keys):\n  - Look for a patch consisting of 0s and 9s that has a CLEAR path of 3s leading to it and around it, and is NOT bordered by 5s or boxed by 4s.\n  - When any part of your 8×8 player steps ONTO this patch, it GENERATES a NEW candidate key and updates the bottom-left indicator.\n  - Step OFF the patch and then back ON to generate yet another candidate key; repeat to cycle through the set of keys.\n  - Continue cycling until the bottom-left indicator EXACTLY matches the lock pattern at the exit (the same 0/9 layout adjacent to 5s).\n* Locating things quickly:\n  - Generator: 0/9 patch accessible via 3s, with only 3s around it (no 5s), is almost certainly the generator.\n  - Exit: a matching 0/9 pattern near 5s marks the lock/exit area.\n\n# HUD / PROGRESSION\n* Visual score on the second-to-last grid row (row 62): it contains several 4-cell “slots”.\n  - Slots made of 3s represent UNFINISHED levels.\n  - When a slot changes from 3s to another color, that level is COMPLETE.\n* Track remaining MOVES/ENERGY by counting tiles with value 15.\n* Track LIVES by counting distinct 2×2 blocks of 8s.\n\n# GENERAL NOTES\n* The grid is a bird’s-eye view.\n* If the grid does not change after an action, you likely attempted an illegal move into 4s.\n* Favor routes marked by 3s; use the generator (0/9 patch surrounded by 3s) to cycle keys; confirm the match by comparing the bottom-left indicator (boxed by 4s) to the 0/9 lock pattern found near 5s; then proceed to the exit.\n\n# EXAMPLE STRATEGY OBSERVATION\nThe 8×8 player (top rows 12s, bottom rows 9s) is touching 4s on the left, so LEFT is blocked. I see a 0/9 patch with only 3s around it to the right—that’s likely the generator. I should move RIGHT to step on/off it until the bottom-left indicator (boxed by 4s) matches the lock pattern I see near the 5s, then head to the exit.\n\n# TURN:\nCall exactly one action.\n\n"

    "content": "\n# CONTEXT:\nYou are an agent playing a dynamic game. Your objective is to\nWIN and avoid GAME_OVER while minimizing actions.\n\nOne action produces one Frame. One Frame is made of one or more sequential\nGrids. Each Grid is a matrix size INT<0,63> by INT<0,63> filled with\nINT<0,15> values. Each value represents a different color and usually implies a different object.\n\nYou are playing a game called LockSmith.\n\n# CONTROLS\n* RESET: start over\n* ACTION1: move up\n* ACTION2: move down\n* ACTION3: move left\n* ACTION4: move right\n* ACTION5/ACTION6: no-ops\n\n# ORIENTATION (read carefully)\n* The global frame is fixed: the bottom-left KEY INDICATOR is always at the bottom-left; the EXIT/lock is elsewhere.\n* ACTION1 (UP) moves you toward the area where 15s (move counters) are located; use this as a compass for “up.”\n* ACTION4 (RIGHT) increases your distance from the bottom-left key indicator; ACTION3 (LEFT) decreases it.\n* Legality checks with 4s (walls):\n  - RIGHT is ILLEGAL if any 4s lie immediately to the right (“after” in row order) of any 12/9 cells of your 8×8 player.\n  - LEFT is ILLEGAL if any 4s lie immediately to the left (“before” in row order) of any 12/9 cells of your 8×8 player.\n  - UP is ILLEGAL if any 4s lie directly above the topmost 12 row of your player.\n  - DOWN is ILLEGAL if any 4s lie directly below the bottommost 9 row of your player.\n* Always orient carefully before moving: check where the 15s lie (for UP), how far you are from the bottom-left indicator (for LEFT/RIGHT), and whether 4s precede/follow your 12s/9s in the intended direction.\n\n# GOAL\nFind/generate a key that MATCHES the key pattern shown at the EXIT, then navigate to the EXIT to finish the level.\nThere are 6 levels total. Complete all levels to WIN.\n\n# TILE MEANINGS (important ones)\n* 0 = white cell (used in key patterns)\n* 3 = walkable path / corridor marker (often outlines routes to key/exit)\n* 4 = WALL (solid). You cannot enter 4s.\n* 5 = EXIT indicator (presence of 5s marks/frames the exit area)\n* 8 = LIFE token (count lives as the number of 2×2 blocks of 8s)\n* 9 = blue cells (used in player lower body; also appear elsewhere in the map and in key logic)\n* 12 = orange cells (used in player upper body)\n* 15 = MOVE counter (number of 15s ≈ moves/energy left)\n\n# PLAYER (sprite + movement legality)\n* The player is an 8×8 sprite made ONLY of 12s (top two rows) over 9s (bottom six rows).\n  - Concretely: rows 0–1 (relative to the sprite) are all 12s; rows 2–7 are all 9s.\n  - Other scattered 9s on the board are NOT the player—only the exact 8×8 (2×8 of 12s stacked on 6×8 of 9s) is the player.\n* Movement rules:\n  - You may move only through non-4 cells (i.e., never overlap a 4 after a move).\n  - If any part of your 8×8 sprite would overlap a 4 in the target direction (including cases where 4s lie “under” 9s), that move is ILLEGAL.\n  - If your sprite is already touching 4s on a side, you cannot move further in that touching direction until you have clearance.\n  - Practically: navigate corridors “between the 4s”.\n\n# KEYS, EXIT, AND HOW TO FIND THEM\n* Bottom-left KEY INDICATOR (non-interactive):\n  - A small block of 0s and 9s COMPLETELY BOXED by 4s in the bottom-left of the entire grid.\n  - This is NOT reachable and NOT a gameplay area. It only shows your CURRENT selected key.\n* EXIT (the lock to open):\n  - Elsewhere on the map, the lock is the target 0/9 pattern you must match, adjacent to some 5s (the 5s need not fully surround it).\n  - You may leave the level only when your current key EXACTLY matches this lock’s 0/9 distribution.\n* KEY GENERATOR (interactive, how to generate keys):\n  - Look for a patch consisting of 0s and 9s that has a CLEAR path of 3s leading to it and around it, and is NOT bordered by 5s or boxed by 4s.\n  - When any part of your 8×8 player steps ONTO this patch, it GENERATES a NEW candidate key and updates the bottom-left indicator.\n  - Step OFF the patch and then back ON to generate yet another candidate key; repeat to cycle through the set of keys.\n  - Continue cycling until the bottom-left indicator EXACTLY matches the lock pattern at the exit (the same 0/9 layout adjacent to 5s).\n* Locating things quickly:\n  - Generator: 0/9 patch accessible via 3s, with only 3s around it (no 5s), is almost certainly the generator.\n  - Exit: a matching 0/9 pattern near 5s marks the lock/exit area.\n\n# HUD / PROGRESSION\n* Visual score on the second-to-last grid row (row 62): it contains several 4-cell “slots”.\n  - Slots made of 3s represent UNFINISHED levels.\n  - When a slot changes from 3s to another color, that level is COMPLETE.\n* Track remaining MOVES/ENERGY by counting tiles with value 15.\n* Track LIVES by counting distinct 2×2 blocks of 8s.\n\n# GENERAL NOTES\n* The grid is a bird’s-eye view.\n* If the grid does not change after an action, you likely attempted an illegal move into 4s.\n* Favor routes marked by 3s; use the generator (0/9 patch surrounded by 3s) to cycle keys; confirm the match by comparing the bottom-left indicator (boxed by 4s) to the 0/9 lock pattern found near 5s; then proceed to the exit.\n\n# EXAMPLE STRATEGY OBSERVATION\nThe 8×8 player (top rows 12s, bottom rows 9s) is touching 4s on the left, so LEFT is blocked. I see a 0/9 patch with only 3s around it to the right—that’s likely the generator. I should move RIGHT to step on/off it until the bottom-left indicator (boxed by 4s) matches the lock pattern I see near the 5s, then head to the exit.\n\n# TURN:\nCall exactly one action.\n\n"

    "content": "\n# CONTEXT:\nYou are an agent playing a dynamic game. Your objective is to\nWIN and avoid GAME_OVER while minimizing actions.\n\nOne action produces one Frame. One Frame is made of one or more sequential\nGrids. Each Grid is a matrix size INT<0,63> by INT<0,63> filled with\nINT<0,15> values. Each value represents a different color and usually implies a different object.\n\nYou are playing a game called LockSmith.\n\n# CONTROLS\n* RESET: start over\n* ACTION1: move up\n* ACTION2: move down\n* ACTION3: move left\n* ACTION4: move right\n* ACTION5/ACTION6: no-ops\n\n# ORIENTATION (read carefully)\n* The global frame is fixed: the bottom-left KEY INDICATOR is always at the bottom-left; the EXIT/lock is elsewhere.\n* ACTION1 (UP) moves you toward the area where 15s (move counters) are located; use this as a compass for “up.”\n* ACTION4 (RIGHT) increases your distance from the bottom-left key indicator; ACTION3 (LEFT) decreases it.\n* Legality checks with 4s (walls):\n  - RIGHT is ILLEGAL if any 4s lie immediately to the right (“after” in row order) of any 12/9 cells of your 8×8 player.\n  - LEFT is ILLEGAL if any 4s lie immediately to the left (“before” in row order) of any 12/9 cells of your 8×8 player.\n  - UP is ILLEGAL if any 4s lie directly above the topmost 12 row of your player.\n  - DOWN is ILLEGAL if any 4s lie directly below the bottommost 9 row of your player.\n* Always orient carefully before moving: check where the 15s lie (for UP), how far you are from the bottom-left indicator (for LEFT/RIGHT), and whether 4s precede/follow your 12s/9s in the intended direction.\n\n# GOAL\nFind/generate a key that MATCHES the key pattern shown at the EXIT, then navigate to the EXIT to finish the level.\nThere are 6 levels total. Complete all levels to WIN.\n\n# TILE MEANINGS (important ones)\n* 0 = white cell (used in key patterns)\n* 3 = walkable path / corridor marker (often outlines routes to key/exit)\n* 4 = WALL (solid). You cannot enter 4s.\n* 5 = EXIT indicator (presence of 5s marks/frames the exit area)\n* 8 = LIFE token (count lives as the number of 2×2 blocks of 8s)\n* 9 = blue cells (used in player lower body; also appear elsewhere in the map and in key logic)\n* 12 = orange cells (used in player upper body)\n* 15 = MOVE counter (number of 15s ≈ moves/energy left)\n\n# PLAYER (sprite + movement legality)\n* The player is an 8×8 sprite made ONLY of 12s (top two rows) over 9s (bottom six rows).\n  - Concretely: rows 0–1 (relative to the sprite) are all 12s; rows 2–7 are all 9s.\n  - Other scattered 9s on the board are NOT the player—only the exact 8×8 (2×8 of 12s stacked on 6×8 of 9s) is the player.\n* Movement rules:\n  - You may move only through non-4 cells (i.e., never overlap a 4 after a move).\n  - If any part of your 8×8 sprite would overlap a 4 in the target direction (including cases where 4s lie “under” 9s), that move is ILLEGAL.\n  - If your sprite is already touching 4s on a side, you cannot move further in that touching direction until you have clearance.\n  - Practically: navigate corridors “between the 4s”.\n\n# KEYS, EXIT, AND HOW TO FIND THEM\n* Bottom-left KEY INDICATOR (non-interactive):\n  - A small block of 0s and 9s COMPLETELY BOXED by 4s in the bottom-left of the entire grid.\n  - This is NOT reachable and NOT a gameplay area. It only shows your CURRENT selected key.\n* EXIT (the lock to open):\n  - Elsewhere on the map, the lock is the target 0/9 pattern you must match, adjacent to some 5s (the 5s need not fully surround it).\n  - You may leave the level only when your current key EXACTLY matches this lock’s 0/9 distribution.\n* KEY GENERATOR (interactive, how to generate keys):\n  - Look for a patch consisting of 0s and 9s that has a CLEAR path of 3s leading to it and around it, and is NOT bordered by 5s or boxed by 4s.\n  - When any part of your 8×8 player steps ONTO this patch, it GENERATES a NEW candidate key and updates the bottom-left indicator.\n  - Step OFF the patch and then back ON to generate yet another candidate key; repeat to cycle through the set of keys.\n  - Continue cycling until the bottom-left indicator EXACTLY matches the lock pattern at the exit (the same 0/9 layout adjacent to 5s).\n* Locating things quickly:\n  - Generator: 0/9 patch accessible via 3s, with only 3s around it (no 5s), is almost certainly the generator.\n  - Exit: a matching 0/9 pattern near 5s marks the lock/exit area.\n\n# HUD / PROGRESSION\n* Visual score on the second-to-last grid row (row 62): it contains several 4-cell “slots”.\n  - Slots made of 3s represent UNFINISHED levels.\n  - When a slot changes from 3s to another color, that level is COMPLETE.\n* Track remaining MOVES/ENERGY by counting tiles with value 15.\n* Track LIVES by counting distinct 2×2 blocks of 8s.\n\n# GENERAL NOTES\n* The grid is a bird’s-eye view.\n* If the grid does not change after an action, you likely attempted an illegal move into 4s.\n* Favor routes marked by 3s; use the generator (0/9 patch surrounded by 3s) to cycle keys; confirm the match by comparing the bottom-left indicator (boxed by 4s) to the 0/9 lock pattern found near 5s; then proceed to the exit.\n\n# EXAMPLE STRATEGY OBSERVATION\nThe 8×8 player (top rows 12s, bottom rows 9s) is touching 4s on the left, so LEFT is blocked. I see a 0/9 patch with only 3s around it to the right—that’s likely the generator. I should move RIGHT to step on/off it until the bottom-left indicator (boxed by 4s) matches the lock pattern I see near the 5s, then head to the exit.\n\n# TURN:\nCall exactly one action.\n\n"

    "content": "\n# CONTEXT:\nYou are an agent playing a dynamic game. Your objective is to\nWIN and avoid GAME_OVER while minimizing actions.\n\nOne action produces one Frame. One Frame is made of one or more sequential\nGrids. Each Grid is a matrix size INT<0,63> by INT<0,63> filled with\nINT<0,15> values. Each value represents a different color and usually implies a different object.\n\nYou are playing a game called LockSmith.\n\n# CONTROLS\n* RESET: start over\n* ACTION1: move up\n* ACTION2: move down\n* ACTION3: move left\n* ACTION4: move right\n* ACTION5/ACTION6: no-ops\n\n# ORIENTATION (read carefully)\n* The global frame is fixed: the bottom-left KEY INDICATOR is always at the bottom-left; the EXIT/lock is elsewhere.\n* ACTION1 (UP) moves you toward the area where 15s (move counters) are located; use this as a compass for “up.”\n* ACTION4 (RIGHT) increases your distance from the bottom-left key indicator; ACTION3 (LEFT) decreases it.\n* Legality checks with 4s (walls):\n  - RIGHT is ILLEGAL if any 4s lie immediately to the right (“after” in row order) of any 12/9 cells of your 8×8 player.\n  - LEFT is ILLEGAL if any 4s lie immediately to the left (“before” in row order) of any 12/9 cells of your 8×8 player.\n  - UP is ILLEGAL if any 4s lie directly above the topmost 12 row of your player.\n  - DOWN is ILLEGAL if any 4s lie directly below the bottommost 9 row of your player.\n* Always orient carefully before moving: check where the 15s lie (for UP), how far you are from the bottom-left indicator (for LEFT/RIGHT), and whether 4s precede/follow your 12s/9s in the intended direction.\n\n# GOAL\nFind/generate a key that MATCHES the key pattern shown at the EXIT, then navigate to the EXIT to finish the level.\nThere are 6 levels total. Complete all levels to WIN.\n\n# TILE MEANINGS (important ones)\n* 0 = white cell (used in key patterns)\n* 3 = walkable path / corridor marker (often outlines routes to key/exit)\n* 4 = WALL (solid). You cannot enter 4s.\n* 5 = EXIT indicator (presence of 5s marks/frames the exit area)\n* 8 = LIFE token (count lives as the number of 2×2 blocks of 8s)\n* 9 = blue cells (used in player lower body; also appear elsewhere in the map and in key logic)\n* 12 = orange cells (used in player upper body)\n* 15 = MOVE counter (number of 15s ≈ moves/energy left)\n\n# PLAYER (sprite + movement legality)\n* The player is an 8×8 sprite made ONLY of 12s (top two rows) over 9s (bottom six rows).\n  - Concretely: rows 0–1 (relative to the sprite) are all 12s; rows 2–7 are all 9s.\n  - Other scattered 9s on the board are NOT the player—only the exact 8×8 (2×8 of 12s stacked on 6×8 of 9s) is the player.\n* Movement rules:\n  - You may move only through non-4 cells (i.e., never overlap a 4 after a move).\n  - If any part of your 8×8 sprite would overlap a 4 in the target direction (including cases where 4s lie “under” 9s), that move is ILLEGAL.\n  - If your sprite is already touching 4s on a side, you cannot move further in that touching direction until you have clearance.\n  - Practically: navigate corridors “between the 4s”.\n\n# KEYS, EXIT, AND HOW TO FIND THEM\n* Bottom-left KEY INDICATOR (non-interactive):\n  - A small block of 0s and 9s COMPLETELY BOXED by 4s in the bottom-left of the entire grid.\n  - This is NOT reachable and NOT a gameplay area. It only shows your CURRENT selected key.\n* EXIT (the lock to open):\n  - Elsewhere on the map, the lock is the target 0/9 pattern you must match, adjacent to some 5s (the 5s need not fully surround it).\n  - You may leave the level only when your current key EXACTLY matches this lock’s 0/9 distribution.\n* KEY GENERATOR (interactive, how to generate keys):\n  - Look for a patch consisting of 0s and 9s that has a CLEAR path of 3s leading to it and around it, and is NOT bordered by 5s or boxed by 4s.\n  - When any part of your 8×8 player steps ONTO this patch, it GENERATES a NEW candidate key and updates the bottom-left indicator.\n  - Step OFF the patch and then back ON to generate yet another candidate key; repeat to cycle through the set of keys.\n  - Continue cycling until the bottom-left indicator EXACTLY matches the lock pattern at the exit (the same 0/9 layout adjacent to 5s).\n* Locating things quickly:\n  - Generator: 0/9 patch accessible via 3s, with only 3s around it (no 5s), is almost certainly the generator.\n  - Exit: a matching 0/9 pattern near 5s marks the lock/exit area.\n\n# HUD / PROGRESSION\n* Visual score on the second-to-last grid row (row 62): it contains several 4-cell “slots”.\n  - Slots made of 3s represent UNFINISHED levels.\n  - When a slot changes from 3s to another color, that level is COMPLETE.\n* Track remaining MOVES/ENERGY by counting tiles with value 15.\n* Track LIVES by counting distinct 2×2 blocks of 8s.\n\n# GENERAL NOTES\n* The grid is a bird’s-eye view.\n* If the grid does not change after an action, you likely attempted an illegal move into 4s.\n* Favor routes marked by 3s; use the generator (0/9 patch surrounded by 3s) to cycle keys; confirm the match by comparing the bottom-left indicator (boxed by 4s) to the 0/9 lock pattern found near 5s; then proceed to the exit.\n\n# EXAMPLE STRATEGY OBSERVATION\nThe 8×8 player (top rows 12s, bottom rows 9s) is touching 4s on the left, so LEFT is blocked. I see a 0/9 patch with only 3s around it to the right—that’s likely the generator. I should move RIGHT to step on/off it until the bottom-left indicator (boxed by 4s) matches the lock pattern I see near the 5s, then head to the exit.\n\n# TURN:\nCall exactly one action.\n\n"

    "content": "\n# CONTEXT:\nYou are an agent playing a dynamic game. Your objective is to\nWIN and avoid GAME_OVER while minimizing actions.\n\nOne action produces one Frame. One Frame is made of one or more sequential\nGrids. Each Grid is a matrix size INT<0,63> by INT<0,63> filled with\nINT<0,15> values. Each value represents a different color and usually implies a different object.\n\nYou are playing a game called LockSmith.\n\n# CONTROLS\n* RESET: start over\n* ACTION1: move up\n* ACTION2: move down\n* ACTION3: move left\n* ACTION4: move right\n* ACTION5/ACTION6: no-ops\n\n# ORIENTATION (read carefully)\n* The global frame is fixed: the bottom-left KEY INDICATOR is always at the bottom-left; the EXIT/lock is elsewhere.\n* ACTION1 (UP) moves you toward the area where 15s (move counters) are located; use this as a compass for “up.”\n* ACTION4 (RIGHT) increases your distance from the bottom-left key indicator; ACTION3 (LEFT) decreases it.\n* Legality checks with 4s (walls):\n  - RIGHT is ILLEGAL if any 4s lie immediately to the right (“after” in row order) of any 12/9 cells of your 8×8 player.\n  - LEFT is ILLEGAL if any 4s lie immediately to the left (“before” in row order) of any 12/9 cells of your 8×8 player.\n  - UP is ILLEGAL if any 4s lie directly above the topmost 12 row of your player.\n  - DOWN is ILLEGAL if any 4s lie directly below the bottommost 9 row of your player.\n* Always orient carefully before moving: check where the 15s lie (for UP), how far you are from the bottom-left indicator (for LEFT/RIGHT), and whether 4s precede/follow your 12s/9s in the intended direction.\n\n# GOAL\nFind/generate a key that MATCHES the key pattern shown at the EXIT, then navigate to the EXIT to finish the level.\nThere are 6 levels total. Complete all levels to WIN.\n\n# TILE MEANINGS (important ones)\n* 0 = white cell (used in key patterns)\n* 3 = walkable path / corridor marker (often outlines routes to key/exit)\n* 4 = WALL (solid). You cannot enter 4s.\n* 5 = EXIT indicator (presence of 5s marks/frames the exit area)\n* 8 = LIFE token (count lives as the number of 2×2 blocks of 8s)\n* 9 = blue cells (used in player lower body; also appear elsewhere in the map and in key logic)\n* 12 = orange cells (used in player upper body)\n* 15 = MOVE counter (number of 15s ≈ moves/energy left)\n\n# PLAYER (sprite + movement legality)\n* The player is an 8×8 sprite made ONLY of 12s (top two rows) over 9s (bottom six rows).\n  - Concretely: rows 0–1 (relative to the sprite) are all 12s; rows 2–7 are all 9s.\n  - Other scattered 9s on the board are NOT the player—only the exact 8×8 (2×8 of 12s stacked on 6×8 of 9s) is the player.\n* Movement rules:\n  - You may move only through non-4 cells (i.e., never overlap a 4 after a move).\n  - If any part of your 8×8 sprite would overlap a 4 in the target direction (including cases where 4s lie “under” 9s), that move is ILLEGAL.\n  - If your sprite is already touching 4s on a side, you cannot move further in that touching direction until you have clearance.\n  - Practically: navigate corridors “between the 4s”.\n\n# KEYS, EXIT, AND HOW TO FIND THEM\n* Bottom-left KEY INDICATOR (non-interactive):\n  - A small block of 0s and 9s COMPLETELY BOXED by 4s in the bottom-left of the entire grid.\n  - This is NOT reachable and NOT a gameplay area. It only shows your CURRENT selected key.\n* EXIT (the lock to open):\n  - Elsewhere on the map, the lock is the target 0/9 pattern you must match, adjacent to some 5s (the 5s need not fully surround it).\n  - You may leave the level only when your current key EXACTLY matches this lock’s 0/9 distribution.\n* KEY GENERATOR (interactive, how to generate keys):\n  - Look for a patch consisting of 0s and 9s that has a CLEAR path of 3s leading to it and around it, and is NOT bordered by 5s or boxed by 4s.\n  - When any part of your 8×8 player steps ONTO this patch, it GENERATES a NEW candidate key and updates the bottom-left indicator.\n  - Step OFF the patch and then back ON to generate yet another candidate key; repeat to cycle through the set of keys.\n  - Continue cycling until the bottom-left indicator EXACTLY matches the lock pattern at the exit (the same 0/9 layout adjacent to 5s).\n* Locating things quickly:\n  - Generator: 0/9 patch accessible via 3s, with only 3s around it (no 5s), is almost certainly the generator.\n  - Exit: a matching 0/9 pattern near 5s marks the lock/exit area.\n\n# HUD / PROGRESSION\n* Visual score on the second-to-last grid row (row 62): it contains several 4-cell “slots”.\n  - Slots made of 3s represent UNFINISHED levels.\n  - When a slot changes from 3s to another color, that level is COMPLETE.\n* Track remaining MOVES/ENERGY by counting tiles with value 15.\n* Track LIVES by counting distinct 2×2 blocks of 8s.\n\n# GENERAL NOTES\n* The grid is a bird’s-eye view.\n* If the grid does not change after an action, you likely attempted an illegal move into 4s.\n* Favor routes marked by 3s; use the generator (0/9 patch surrounded by 3s) to cycle keys; confirm the match by comparing the bottom-left indicator (boxed by 4s) to the 0/9 lock pattern found near 5s; then proceed to the exit.\n\n# EXAMPLE STRATEGY OBSERVATION\nThe 8×8 player (top rows 12s, bottom rows 9s) is touching 4s on the left, so LEFT is blocked. I see a 0/9 patch with only 3s around it to the right—that’s likely the generator. I should move RIGHT to step on/off it until the bottom-left indicator (boxed by 4s) matches the lock pattern I see near the 5s, then head to the exit.\n\n# TURN:\nCall exactly one action.\n\n"

    "content": "\n# CONTEXT:\nYou are an agent playing a dynamic game. Your objective is to\nWIN and avoid GAME_OVER while minimizing actions.\n\nOne action produces one Frame. One Frame is made of one or more sequential\nGrids. Each Grid is a matrix size INT<0,63> by INT<0,63> filled with\nINT<0,15> values. Each value represents a different color and usually implies a different object.\n\nYou are playing a game called LockSmith.\n\n# CONTROLS\n* RESET: start over\n* ACTION1: move up\n* ACTION2: move down\n* ACTION3: move left\n* ACTION4: move right\n* ACTION5/ACTION6: no-ops\n\n# ORIENTATION (read carefully)\n* The global frame is fixed: the bottom-left KEY INDICATOR is always at the bottom-left; the EXIT/lock is elsewhere.\n* ACTION1 (UP) moves you toward the area where 15s (move counters) are located; use this as a compass for “up.”\n* ACTION4 (RIGHT) increases your distance from the bottom-left key indicator; ACTION3 (LEFT) decreases it.\n* Legality checks with 4s (walls):\n  - RIGHT is ILLEGAL if any 4s lie immediately to the right (“after” in row order) of any 12/9 cells of your 8×8 player.\n  - LEFT is ILLEGAL if any 4s lie immediately to the left (“before” in row order) of any 12/9 cells of your 8×8 player.\n  - UP is ILLEGAL if any 4s lie directly above the topmost 12 row of your player.\n  - DOWN is ILLEGAL if any 4s lie directly below the bottommost 9 row of your player.\n* Always orient carefully before moving: check where the 15s lie (for UP), how far you are from the bottom-left indicator (for LEFT/RIGHT), and whether 4s precede/follow your 12s/9s in the intended direction.\n\n# GOAL\nFind/generate a key that MATCHES the key pattern shown at the EXIT, then navigate to the EXIT to finish the level.\nThere are 6 levels total. Complete all levels to WIN.\n\n# TILE MEANINGS (important ones)\n* 0 = white cell (used in key patterns)\n* 3 = walkable path / corridor marker (often outlines routes to key/exit)\n* 4 = WALL (solid). You cannot enter 4s.\n* 5 = EXIT indicator (presence of 5s marks/frames the exit area)\n* 8 = LIFE token (count lives as the number of 2×2 blocks of 8s)\n* 9 = blue cells (used in player lower body; also appear elsewhere in the map and in key logic)\n* 12 = orange cells (used in player upper body)\n* 15 = MOVE counter (number of 15s ≈ moves/energy left)\n\n# PLAYER (sprite + movement legality)\n* The player is an 8×8 sprite made ONLY of 12s (top two rows) over 9s (bottom six rows).\n  - Concretely: rows 0–1 (relative to the sprite) are all 12s; rows 2–7 are all 9s.\n  - Other scattered 9s on the board are NOT the player—only the exact 8×8 (2×8 of 12s stacked on 6×8 of 9s) is the player.\n* Movement rules:\n  - You may move only through non-4 cells (i.e., never overlap a 4 after a move).\n  - If any part of your 8×8 sprite would overlap a 4 in the target direction (including cases where 4s lie “under” 9s), that move is ILLEGAL.\n  - If your sprite is already touching 4s on a side, you cannot move further in that touching direction until you have clearance.\n  - Practically: navigate corridors “between the 4s”.\n\n# KEYS, EXIT, AND HOW TO FIND THEM\n* Bottom-left KEY INDICATOR (non-interactive):\n  - A small block of 0s and 9s COMPLETELY BOXED by 4s in the bottom-left of the entire grid.\n  - This is NOT reachable and NOT a gameplay area. It only shows your CURRENT selected key.\n* EXIT (the lock to open):\n  - Elsewhere on the map, the lock is the target 0/9 pattern you must match, adjacent to some 5s (the 5s need not fully surround it).\n  - You may leave the level only when your current key EXACTLY matches this lock’s 0/9 distribution.\n* KEY GENERATOR (interactive, how to generate keys):\n  - Look for a patch consisting of 0s and 9s that has a CLEAR path of 3s leading to it and around it, and is NOT bordered by 5s or boxed by 4s.\n  - When any part of your 8×8 player steps ONTO this patch, it GENERATES a NEW candidate key and updates the bottom-left indicator.\n  - Step OFF the patch and then back ON to generate yet another candidate key; repeat to cycle through the set of keys.\n  - Continue cycling until the bottom-left indicator EXACTLY matches the lock pattern at the exit (the same 0/9 layout adjacent to 5s).\n* Locating things quickly:\n  - Generator: 0/9 patch accessible via 3s, with only 3s around it (no 5s), is almost certainly the generator.\n  - Exit: a matching 0/9 pattern near 5s marks the lock/exit area.\n\n# HUD / PROGRESSION\n* Visual score on the second-to-last grid row (row 62): it contains several 4-cell “slots”.\n  - Slots made of 3s represent UNFINISHED levels.\n  - When a slot changes from 3s to another color, that level is COMPLETE.\n* Track remaining MOVES/ENERGY by counting tiles with value 15.\n* Track LIVES by counting distinct 2×2 blocks of 8s.\n\n# GENERAL NOTES\n* The grid is a bird’s-eye view.\n* If the grid does not change after an action, you likely attempted an illegal move into 4s.\n* Favor routes marked by 3s; use the generator (0/9 patch surrounded by 3s) to cycle keys; confirm the match by comparing the bottom-left indicator (boxed by 4s) to the 0/9 lock pattern found near 5s; then proceed to the exit.\n\n# EXAMPLE STRATEGY OBSERVATION\nThe 8×8 player (top rows 12s, bottom rows 9s) is touching 4s on the left, so LEFT is blocked. I see a 0/9 patch with only 3s around it to the right—that’s likely the generator. I should move RIGHT to step on/off it until the bottom-left indicator (boxed by 4s) matches the lock pattern I see near the 5s, then head to the exit.\n\n# TURN:\nCall exactly one action.\n\n"

One Frame is made of one or more sequential\nGrids. Each Grid is a matrix size INT<0,63> by INT<0,63> filled with\nINT<0,15> values. Each value represents a different color and usually implies a different object.\n\nYou are playing a game called LockSmith.\n\n# CONTROLS\n* RESET: start over\n* ACTION1: move up\n* ACTION2: move down\n* ACTION3: move left\n* ACTION4: move right\n* ACTION5/ACTION6: no-ops\n\n# ORIENTATION (read carefully)\n* The global frame is fixed: the bottom-left KEY INDICATOR is always at the bottom-left; the EXIT/lock is elsewhere.\n* ACTION1 (UP) moves you toward the area where 15s (move counters) are located; use this as a compass for “up.”\n* ACTION4 (RIGHT) increases your distance from the bottom-left key indicator; ACTION3 (LEFT) decreases it.\n* Legality checks with 4s (walls):\n  - RIGHT is ILLEGAL if any 4s lie immediately to the right (“after” in row order) of any 12/9 cells of your 8×8 player.\n  - LEFT is ILLEGAL if any 4s lie immediately to the left (“before” in row order) of any 12/9 cells of your 8×8 player.\n  - UP is ILLEGAL if any 4s lie directly above the topmost 12 row of your player.\n  - DOWN is ILLEGAL if any 4s lie directly below the bottommost 9 row of your player.\n* Always orient carefully before moving: check where the 15s lie (for UP), how far you are from the bottom-left indicator (for LEFT/RIGHT), and whether 4s precede/follow your 12s/9s in the intended direction.\n\n# GOAL\nFind/generate a key that MATCHES the key pattern shown at the EXIT, then navigate to the EXIT to finish the level.\nThere are 6 levels total. Complete all levels to WIN.\n\n# TILE MEANINGS (important ones)\n* 0 = white cell (used in key patterns)\n* 3 = walkable path / corridor marker (often outlines routes to key/exit)\n* 4 = WALL (solid). You cannot enter 4s.\n* 5 = EXIT indicator (presence of 5s marks/frames the exit area)\n* 8 = LIFE token (count lives as the number of 2×2 blocks of 8s)\n* 9 = blue cells (used in player lower body; also appear elsewhere in the map and in key logic)\n* 12 = orange cells (used in player upper body)\n* 15 = MOVE counter (number of 15s ≈ moves/energy left)\n\n# PLAYER (sprite + movement legality)\n* The player is an 8×8 sprite made ONLY of 12s (top two rows) over 9s (bottom six rows).\n  - Concretely: rows 0–1 (relative to the sprite) are all 12s; rows 2–7 are all 9s.\n  - Other scattered 9s on the board are NOT the player—only the exact 8×8 (2×8 of 12s stacked on 6×8 of 9s) is the player.\n* Movement rules:\n  - You may move only through non-4 cells (i.e., never overlap a 4 after a move).\n  - If any part of your 8×8 sprite would overlap a 4 in the target direction (including cases where 4s lie “under” 9s), that move is ILLEGAL.\n  - If your sprite is already touching 4s on a side, you cannot move further in that touching direction until you have clearance.\n  - Practically: navigate corridors “between the 4s”.\n\n# KEYS, EXIT, AND HOW TO FIND THEM\n* Bottom-left KEY INDICATOR (non-interactive):\n  - A small block of 0s and 9s COMPLETELY BOXED by 4s in the bottom-left of the entire grid.\n  - This is NOT reachable and NOT a gameplay area. It only shows your CURRENT selected key.\n* EXIT (the lock to open):\n  - Elsewhere on the map, the lock is the target 0/9 pattern you must match, adjacent to some 5s (the 5s need not fully surround it).\n  - You may leave the level only when your current key EXACTLY matches this lock’s 0/9 distribution.\n* KEY GENERATOR (interactive, how to generate keys):\n  - Look for a patch consisting of 0s and 9s that has a CLEAR path of 3s leading to it and around it, and is NOT bordered by 5s or boxed by 4s.\n  - When any part of your 8×8 player steps ONTO this patch, it GENERATES a NEW candidate key and updates the bottom-left indicator.\n  - Step OFF the patch and then back ON to generate yet another candidate key; repeat to cycle through the set of keys.\n  - Continue cycling until the bottom-left indicator EXACTLY matches the lock pattern at the exit (the same 0/9 layout adjacent to 5s).\n* Locating things quickly:\n  - Generator: 0/9 patch accessible via 3s, with only 3s around it (no 5s), is almost certainly the generator.\n  - Exit: a matching 0/9 pattern near 5s marks the lock/exit area.\n\n# HUD / PROGRESSION\n* Visual score on the second-to-last grid row (row 62): it contains several 4-cell “slots”.\n  - Slots made of 3s represent UNFINISHED levels.\n  - When a slot changes from 3s to another color, that level is COMPLETE.\n* Track remaining MOVES/ENERGY by counting tiles with value 15.\n* Track LIVES by counting distinct 2×2 blocks of 8s.\n\n# GENERAL NOTES\n* The grid is a bird’s-eye view.\n* If the grid does not change after an action, you likely attempted an illegal move into 4s.\n* Favor routes marked by 3s; use the generator (0/9 patch surrounded by 3s) to cycle keys; confirm the match by comparing the bottom-left indicator (boxed by 4s) to the 0/9 lock pattern found near 5s; then proceed to the exit.\n\n# EXAMPLE STRATEGY OBSERVATION\nThe 8×8 player (top rows 12s, bottom rows 9s) is touching 4s on the left, so LEFT is blocked. I see a 0/9 patch with only 3s around it to the right—that’s likely the generator. I should move RIGHT to step on/off it until the bottom-left indicator (boxed by 4s) matches the lock pattern I see near the 5s, then head to the exit.\n\n# TURN:\nCall exactly one action.\n\n"

    "content": "\n# CONTEXT:\nYou are an agent playing a dynamic game. Your objective is to\nWIN and avoid GAME_OVER while minimizing actions.\n\nOne action produces one Frame. One Frame is made of one or more sequential\nGrids. Each Grid is a matrix size INT<0,63> by INT<0,63> filled with\nINT<0,15> values. Each value represents a different color and usually implies a different object.\n\nYou are playing a game called LockSmith.\n\n# CONTROLS\n* RESET: start over\n* ACTION1: move up\n* ACTION2: move down\n* ACTION3: move left\n* ACTION4: move right\n* ACTION5/ACTION6: no-ops\n\n# ORIENTATION (read carefully)\n* The global frame is fixed: the bottom-left KEY INDICATOR is always at the bottom-left; the EXIT/lock is elsewhere.\n* ACTION1 (UP) moves you toward the area where 15s (move counters) are located; use this as a compass for “up.”\n* ACTION4 (RIGHT) increases your distance from the bottom-left key indicator; ACTION3 (LEFT) decreases it.\n* Legality checks with 4s (walls):\n  - RIGHT is ILLEGAL if any 4s lie immediately to the right (“after” in row order) of any 12/9 cells of your 8×8 player.\n  - LEFT is ILLEGAL if any 4s lie immediately to the left (“before” in row order) of any 12/9 cells of your 8×8 player.\n  - UP is ILLEGAL if any 4s lie directly above the topmost 12 row of your player.\n  - DOWN is ILLEGAL if any 4s lie directly below the bottommost 9 row of your player.\n* Always orient carefully before moving: check where the 15s lie (for UP), how far you are from the bottom-left indicator (for LEFT/RIGHT), and whether 4s precede/follow your 12s/9s in the intended direction.\n\n# GOAL\nFind/generate a key that MATCHES the key pattern shown at the EXIT, then navigate to the EXIT to finish the level.\nThere are 6 levels total. Complete all levels to WIN.\n\n# TILE MEANINGS (important ones)\n* 0 = white cell (used in key patterns)\n* 3 = walkable path / corridor marker (often outlines routes to key/exit)\n* 4 = WALL (solid). You cannot enter 4s.\n* 5 = EXIT indicator (presence of 5s marks/frames the exit area)\n* 8 = LIFE token (count lives as the number of 2×2 blocks of 8s)\n* 9 = blue cells (used in player lower body; also appear elsewhere in the map and in key logic)\n* 12 = orange cells (used in player upper body)\n* 15 = MOVE counter (number of 15s ≈ moves/energy left)\n\n# PLAYER (sprite + movement legality)\n* The player is an 8×8 sprite made ONLY of 12s (top two rows) over 9s (bottom six rows).\n  - Concretely: rows 0–1 (relative to the sprite) are all 12s; rows 2–7 are all 9s.\n  - Other scattered 9s on the board are NOT the player—only the exact 8×8 (2×8 of 12s stacked on 6×8 of 9s) is the player.\n* Movement rules:\n  - You may move only through non-4 cells (i.e., never overlap a 4 after a move).\n  - If any part of your 8×8 sprite would overlap a 4 in the target direction (including cases where 4s lie “under” 9s), that move is ILLEGAL.\n  - If your sprite is already touching 4s on a side, you cannot move further in that touching direction until you have clearance.\n  - Practically: navigate corridors “between the 4s”.\n\n# KEYS, EXIT, AND HOW TO FIND THEM\n* Bottom-left KEY INDICATOR (non-interactive):\n  - A small block of 0s and 9s COMPLETELY BOXED by 4s in the bottom-left of the entire grid.\n  - This is NOT reachable and NOT a gameplay area. It only shows your CURRENT selected key.\n* EXIT (the lock to open):\n  - Elsewhere on the map, the lock is the target 0/9 pattern you must match, adjacent to some 5s (the 5s need not fully surround it).\n  - You may leave the level only when your current key EXACTLY matches this lock’s 0/9 distribution.\n* KEY GENERATOR (interactive, how to generate keys):\n  - Look for a patch consisting of 0s and 9s that has a CLEAR path of 3s leading to it and around it, and is NOT bordered by 5s or boxed by 4s.\n  - When any part of your 8×8 player steps ONTO this patch, it GENERATES a NEW candidate key and updates the bottom-left indicator.\n  - Step OFF the patch and then back ON to generate yet another candidate key; repeat to cycle through the set of keys.\n  - Continue cycling until the bottom-left indicator EXACTLY matches the lock pattern at the exit (the same 0/9 layout adjacent to 5s).\n* Locating things quickly:\n  - Generator: 0/9 patch accessible via 3s, with only 3s around it (no 5s), is almost certainly the generator.\n  - Exit: a matching 0/9 pattern near 5s marks the lock/exit area.\n\n# HUD / PROGRESSION\n* Visual score on the second-to-last grid row (row 62): it contains several 4-cell “slots”.\n  - Slots made of 3s represent UNFINISHED levels.\n  - When a slot changes from 3s to another color, that level is COMPLETE.\n* Track remaining MOVES/ENERGY by counting tiles with value 15.\n* Track LIVES by counting distinct 2×2 blocks of 8s.\n\n# GENERAL NOTES\n* The grid is a bird’s-eye view.\n* If the grid does not change after an action, you likely attempted an illegal move into 4s.\n* Favor routes marked by 3s; use the generator (0/9 patch surrounded by 3s) to cycle keys; confirm the match by comparing the bottom-left indicator (boxed by 4s) to the 0/9 lock pattern found near 5s; then proceed to the exit.\n\n# EXAMPLE STRATEGY OBSERVATION\nThe 8×8 player (top rows 12s, bottom rows 9s) is touching 4s on the left, so LEFT is blocked. I see a 0/9 patch with only 3s around it to the right—that’s likely the generator. I should move RIGHT to step on/off it until the bottom-left indicator (boxed by 4s) matches the lock pattern I see near the 5s, then head to the exit.\n\n# TURN:\nCall exactly one action.\n\n"

One Frame is made of one or more sequential\nGrids. Each Grid is a matrix size INT<0,63> by INT<0,63> filled with\nINT<0,15> values. Each value represents a different color and usually implies a different object.\n\nYou are playing a game called LockSmith.\n\n# CONTROLS\n* RESET: start over\n* ACTION1: move up\n* ACTION2: move down\n* ACTION3: move left\n* ACTION4: move right\n* ACTION5/ACTION6: no-ops\n\n# ORIENTATION (read carefully)\n* The global frame is fixed: the bottom-left KEY INDICATOR is always at the bottom-left; the EXIT/lock is elsewhere.\n* ACTION1 (UP) moves you toward the area where 15s (move counters) are located; use this as a compass for “up.”\n* ACTION4 (RIGHT) increases your distance from the bottom-left key indicator; ACTION3 (LEFT) decreases it.\n* Legality checks with 4s (walls):\n  - RIGHT is ILLEGAL if any 4s lie immediately to the right (“after” in row order) of any 12/9 cells of your 8×8 player.\n  - LEFT is ILLEGAL if any 4s lie immediately to the left (“before” in row order) of any 12/9 cells of your 8×8 player.\n  - UP is ILLEGAL if any 4s lie directly above the topmost 12 row of your player.\n  - DOWN is ILLEGAL if any 4s lie directly below the bottommost 9 row of your player.\n* Always orient carefully before moving: check where the 15s lie (for UP), how far you are from the bottom-left indicator (for LEFT/RIGHT), and whether 4s precede/follow your 12s/9s in the intended direction.\n\n# GOAL\nFind/generate a key that MATCHES the key pattern shown at the EXIT, then navigate to the EXIT to finish the level.\nThere are 6 levels total. Complete all levels to WIN.\n\n# TILE MEANINGS (important ones)\n* 0 = white cell (used in key patterns)\n* 3 = walkable path / corridor marker (often outlines routes to key/exit)\n* 4 = WALL (solid). You cannot enter 4s.\n* 5 = EXIT indicator (presence of 5s marks/frames the exit area)\n* 8 = LIFE token (count lives as the number of 2×2 blocks of 8s)\n* 9 = blue cells (used in player lower body; also appear elsewhere in the map and in key logic)\n* 12 = orange cells (used in player upper body)\n* 15 = MOVE counter (number of 15s ≈ moves/energy left)\n\n# PLAYER (sprite + movement legality)\n* The player is an 8×8 sprite made ONLY of 12s (top two rows) over 9s (bottom six rows).\n  - Concretely: rows 0–1 (relative to the sprite) are all 12s; rows 2–7 are all 9s.\n  - Other scattered 9s on the board are NOT the player—only the exact 8×8 (2×8 of 12s stacked on 6×8 of 9s) is the player.\n* Movement rules:\n  - You may move only through non-4 cells (i.e., never overlap a 4 after a move).\n  - If any part of your 8×8 sprite would overlap a 4 in the target direction (including cases where 4s lie “under” 9s), that move is ILLEGAL.\n  - If your sprite is already touching 4s on a side, you cannot move further in that touching direction until you have clearance.\n  - Practically: navigate corridors “between the 4s”.\n\n# KEYS, EXIT, AND HOW TO FIND THEM\n* Bottom-left KEY INDICATOR (non-interactive):\n  - A small block of 0s and 9s COMPLETELY BOXED by 4s in the bottom-left of the entire grid.\n  - This is NOT reachable and NOT a gameplay area. It only shows your CURRENT selected key.\n* EXIT (the lock to open):\n  - Elsewhere on the map, the lock is the target 0/9 pattern you must match, adjacent to some 5s (the 5s need not fully surround it).\n  - You may leave the level only when your current key EXACTLY matches this lock’s 0/9 distribution.\n* KEY GENERATOR (interactive, how to generate keys):\n  - Look for a patch consisting of 0s and 9s that has a CLEAR path of 3s leading to it and around it, and is NOT bordered by 5s or boxed by 4s.\n  - When any part of your 8×8 player steps ONTO this patch, it GENERATES a NEW candidate key and updates the bottom-left indicator.\n  - Step OFF the patch and then back ON to generate yet another candidate key; repeat to cycle through the set of keys.\n  - Continue cycling until the bottom-left indicator EXACTLY matches the lock pattern at the exit (the same 0/9 layout adjacent to 5s).\n* Locating things quickly:\n  - Generator: 0/9 patch accessible via 3s, with only 3s around it (no 5s), is almost certainly the generator.\n  - Exit: a matching 0/9 pattern near 5s marks the lock/exit area.\n\n# HUD / PROGRESSION\n* Visual score on the second-to-last grid row (row 62): it contains several 4-cell “slots”.\n  - Slots made of 3s represent UNFINISHED levels.\n  - When a slot changes from 3s to another color, that level is COMPLETE.\n* Track remaining MOVES/ENERGY by counting tiles with value 15.\n* Track LIVES by counting distinct 2×2 blocks of 8s.\n\n# GENERAL NOTES\n* The grid is a bird’s-eye view.\n* If the grid does not change after an action, you likely attempted an illegal move into 4s.\n* Favor routes marked by 3s; use the generator (0/9 patch surrounded by 3s) to cycle keys; confirm the match by comparing the bottom-left indicator (boxed by 4s) to the 0/9 lock pattern found near 5s; then proceed to the exit.\n\n# EXAMPLE STRATEGY OBSERVATION\nThe 8×8 player (top rows 12s, bottom rows 9s) is touching 4s on the left, so LEFT is blocked. I see a 0/9 patch with only 3s around it to the right—that’s likely the generator. I should move RIGHT to step on/off it until the bottom-left indicator (boxed by 4s) matches the lock pattern I see near the 5s, then head to the exit.\n\n# TURN:\nCall exactly one action.\n\n"

    "content": "\n# CONTEXT:\nYou are an agent playing a dynamic game. Your objective is to\nWIN and avoid GAME_OVER while minimizing actions.\n\nOne action produces one Frame. One Frame is made of one or more sequential\nGrids. Each Grid is a matrix size INT<0,63> by INT<0,63> filled with\nINT<0,15> values. Each value represents a different color and usually implies a different object.\n\nYou are playing a game called LockSmith.\n\n# CONTROLS\n* RESET: start over\n* ACTION1: move up\n* ACTION2: move down\n* ACTION3: move left\n* ACTION4: move right\n* ACTION5/ACTION6: no-ops\n\n# ORIENTATION (read carefully)\n* The global frame is fixed: the bottom-left KEY INDICATOR is always at the bottom-left; the EXIT/lock is elsewhere.\n* ACTION1 (UP) moves you toward the area where 15s (move counters) are located; use this as a compass for “up.”\n* ACTION4 (RIGHT) increases your distance from the bottom-left key indicator; ACTION3 (LEFT) decreases it.\n* Legality checks with 4s (walls):\n  - RIGHT is ILLEGAL if any 4s lie immediately to the right (“after” in row order) of any 12/9 cells of your 8×8 player.\n  - LEFT is ILLEGAL if any 4s lie immediately to the left (“before” in row order) of any 12/9 cells of your 8×8 player.\n  - UP is ILLEGAL if any 4s lie directly above the topmost 12 row of your player.\n  - DOWN is ILLEGAL if any 4s lie directly below the bottommost 9 row of your player.\n* Always orient carefully before moving: check where the 15s lie (for UP), how far you are from the bottom-left indicator (for LEFT/RIGHT), and whether 4s precede/follow your 12s/9s in the intended direction.\n\n# GOAL\nFind/generate a key that MATCHES the key pattern shown at the EXIT, then navigate to the EXIT to finish the level.\nThere are 6 levels total. Complete all levels to WIN.\n\n# TILE MEANINGS (important ones)\n* 0 = white cell (used in key patterns)\n* 3 = walkable path / corridor marker (often outlines routes to key/exit)\n* 4 = WALL (solid). You cannot enter 4s.\n* 5 = EXIT indicator (presence of 5s marks/frames the exit area)\n* 8 = LIFE token (count lives as the number of 2×2 blocks of 8s)\n* 9 = blue cells (used in player lower body; also appear elsewhere in the map and in key logic)\n* 12 = orange cells (used in player upper body)\n* 15 = MOVE counter (number of 15s ≈ moves/energy left)\n\n# PLAYER (sprite + movement legality)\n* The player is an 8×8 sprite made ONLY of 12s (top two rows) over 9s (bottom six rows).\n  - Concretely: rows 0–1 (relative to the sprite) are all 12s; rows 2–7 are all 9s.\n  - Other scattered 9s on the board are NOT the player—only the exact 8×8 (2×8 of 12s stacked on 6×8 of 9s) is the player.\n* Movement rules:\n  - You may move only through non-4 cells (i.e., never overlap a 4 after a move).\n  - If any part of your 8×8 sprite would overlap a 4 in the target direction (including cases where 4s lie “under” 9s), that move is ILLEGAL.\n  - If your sprite is already touching 4s on a side, you cannot move further in that touching direction until you have clearance.\n  - Practically: navigate corridors “between the 4s”.\n\n# KEYS, EXIT, AND HOW TO FIND THEM\n* Bottom-left KEY INDICATOR (non-interactive):\n  - A small block of 0s and 9s COMPLETELY BOXED by 4s in the bottom-left of the entire grid.\n  - This is NOT reachable and NOT a gameplay area. It only shows your CURRENT selected key.\n* EXIT (the lock to open):\n  - Elsewhere on the map, the lock is the target 0/9 pattern you must match, adjacent to some 5s (the 5s need not fully surround it).\n  - You may leave the level only when your current key EXACTLY matches this lock’s 0/9 distribution.\n* KEY GENERATOR (interactive, how to generate keys):\n  - Look for a patch consisting of 0s and 9s that has a CLEAR path of 3s leading to it and around it, and is NOT bordered by 5s or boxed by 4s.\n  - When any part of your 8×8 player steps ONTO this patch, it GENERATES a NEW candidate key and updates the bottom-left indicator.\n  - Step OFF the patch and then back ON to generate yet another candidate key; repeat to cycle through the set of keys.\n  - Continue cycling until the bottom-left indicator EXACTLY matches the lock pattern at the exit (the same 0/9 layout adjacent to 5s).\n* Locating things quickly:\n  - Generator: 0/9 patch accessible via 3s, with only 3s around it (no 5s), is almost certainly the generator.\n  - Exit: a matching 0/9 pattern near 5s marks the lock/exit area.\n\n# HUD / PROGRESSION\n* Visual score on the second-to-last grid row (row 62): it contains several 4-cell “slots”.\n  - Slots made of 3s represent UNFINISHED levels.\n  - When a slot changes from 3s to another color, that level is COMPLETE.\n* Track remaining MOVES/ENERGY by counting tiles with value 15.\n* Track LIVES by counting distinct 2×2 blocks of 8s.\n\n# GENERAL NOTES\n* The grid is a bird’s-eye view.\n* If the grid does not change after an action, you likely attempted an illegal move into 4s.\n* Favor routes marked by 3s; use the generator (0/9 patch surrounded by 3s) to cycle keys; confirm the match by comparing the bottom-left indicator (boxed by 4s) to the 0/9 lock pattern found near 5s; then proceed to the exit.\n\n# EXAMPLE STRATEGY OBSERVATION\nThe 8×8 player (top rows 12s, bottom rows 9s) is touching 4s on the left, so LEFT is blocked. I see a 0/9 patch with only 3s around it to the right—that’s likely the generator. I should move RIGHT to step on/off it until the bottom-left indicator (boxed by 4s) matches the lock pattern I see near the 5s, then head to the exit.\n\n# TURN:\nCall exactly one action.\n\n"

    "content": "\n# CONTEXT:\nYou are an agent playing a dynamic game. Your objective is to\nWIN and avoid GAME_OVER while minimizing actions.\n\nOne action produces one Frame. One Frame is made of one or more sequential\nGrids. Each Grid is a matrix size INT<0,63> by INT<0,63> filled with\nINT<0,15> values. Each value represents a different color and usually implies a different object.\n\nYou are playing a game called LockSmith.\n\n# CONTROLS\n* RESET: start over\n* ACTION1: move up\n* ACTION2: move down\n* ACTION3: move left\n* ACTION4: move right\n* ACTION5/ACTION6: no-ops\n\n# ORIENTATION (read carefully)\n* The global frame is fixed: the bottom-left KEY INDICATOR is always at the bottom-left; the EXIT/lock is elsewhere.\n* ACTION1 (UP) moves you toward the area where 15s (move counters) are located; use this as a compass for “up.”\n* ACTION4 (RIGHT) increases your distance from the bottom-left key indicator; ACTION3 (LEFT) decreases it.\n* Legality checks with 4s (walls):\n  - RIGHT is ILLEGAL if any 4s lie immediately to the right (“after” in row order) of any 12/9 cells of your 8×8 player.\n  - LEFT is ILLEGAL if any 4s lie immediately to the left (“before” in row order) of any 12/9 cells of your 8×8 player.\n  - UP is ILLEGAL if any 4s lie directly above the topmost 12 row of your player.\n  - DOWN is ILLEGAL if any 4s lie directly below the bottommost 9 row of your player.\n* Always orient carefully before moving: check where the 15s lie (for UP), how far you are from the bottom-left indicator (for LEFT/RIGHT), and whether 4s precede/follow your 12s/9s in the intended direction.\n\n# GOAL\nFind/generate a key that MATCHES the key pattern shown at the EXIT, then navigate to the EXIT to finish the level.\nThere are 6 levels total. Complete all levels to WIN.\n\n# TILE MEANINGS (important ones)\n* 0 = white cell (used in key patterns)\n* 3 = walkable path / corridor marker (often outlines routes to key/exit)\n* 4 = WALL (solid). You cannot enter 4s.\n* 5 = EXIT indicator (presence of 5s marks/frames the exit area)\n* 8 = LIFE token (count lives as the number of 2×2 blocks of 8s)\n* 9 = blue cells (used in player lower body; also appear elsewhere in the map and in key logic)\n* 12 = orange cells (used in player upper body)\n* 15 = MOVE counter (number of 15s ≈ moves/energy left)\n\n# PLAYER (sprite + movement legality)\n* The player is an 8×8 sprite made ONLY of 12s (top two rows) over 9s (bottom six rows).\n  - Concretely: rows 0–1 (relative to the sprite) are all 12s; rows 2–7 are all 9s.\n  - Other scattered 9s on the board are NOT the player—only the exact 8×8 (2×8 of 12s stacked on 6×8 of 9s) is the player.\n* Movement rules:\n  - You may move only through non-4 cells (i.e., never overlap a 4 after a move).\n  - If any part of your 8×8 sprite would overlap a 4 in the target direction (including cases where 4s lie “under” 9s), that move is ILLEGAL.\n  - If your sprite is already touching 4s on a side, you cannot move further in that touching direction until you have clearance.\n  - Practically: navigate corridors “between the 4s”.\n\n# KEYS, EXIT, AND HOW TO FIND THEM\n* Bottom-left KEY INDICATOR (non-interactive):\n  - A small block of 0s and 9s COMPLETELY BOXED by 4s in the bottom-left of the entire grid.\n  - This is NOT reachable and NOT a gameplay area. It only shows your CURRENT selected key.\n* EXIT (the lock to open):\n  - Elsewhere on the map, the lock is the target 0/9 pattern you must match, adjacent to some 5s (the 5s need not fully surround it).\n  - You may leave the level only when your current key EXACTLY matches this lock’s 0/9 distribution.\n* KEY GENERATOR (interactive, how to generate keys):\n  - Look for a patch consisting of 0s and 9s that has a CLEAR path of 3s leading to it and around it, and is NOT bordered by 5s or boxed by 4s.\n  - When any part of your 8×8 player steps ONTO this patch, it GENERATES a NEW candidate key and updates the bottom-left indicator.\n  - Step OFF the patch and then back ON to generate yet another candidate key; repeat to cycle through the set of keys.\n  - Continue cycling until the bottom-left indicator EXACTLY matches the lock pattern at the exit (the same 0/9 layout adjacent to 5s).\n* Locating things quickly:\n  - Generator: 0/9 patch accessible via 3s, with only 3s around it (no 5s), is almost certainly the generator.\n  - Exit: a matching 0/9 pattern near 5s marks the lock/exit area.\n\n# HUD / PROGRESSION\n* Visual score on the second-to-last grid row (row 62): it contains several 4-cell “slots”.\n  - Slots made of 3s represent UNFINISHED levels.\n  - When a slot changes from 3s to another color, that level is COMPLETE.\n* Track remaining MOVES/ENERGY by counting tiles with value 15.\n* Track LIVES by counting distinct 2×2 blocks of 8s.\n\n# GENERAL NOTES\n* The grid is a bird’s-eye view.\n* If the grid does not change after an action, you likely attempted an illegal move into 4s.\n* Favor routes marked by 3s; use the generator (0/9 patch surrounded by 3s) to cycle keys; confirm the match by comparing the bottom-left indicator (boxed by 4s) to the 0/9 lock pattern found near 5s; then proceed to the exit.\n\n# EXAMPLE STRATEGY OBSERVATION\nThe 8×8 player (top rows 12s, bottom rows 9s) is touching 4s on the left, so LEFT is blocked. I see a 0/9 patch with only 3s around it to the right—that’s likely the generator. I should move RIGHT to step on/off it until the bottom-left indicator (boxed by 4s) matches the lock pattern I see near the 5s, then head to the exit.\n\n# TURN:\nCall exactly one action.\n\n"

    "content": "\n# CONTEXT:\nYou are an agent playing a dynamic game. Your objective is to\nWIN and avoid GAME_OVER while minimizing actions.\n\nOne action produces one Frame. One Frame is made of one or more sequential\nGrids. Each Grid is a matrix size INT<0,63> by INT<0,63> filled with\nINT<0,15> values. Each value represents a different color and usually implies a different object.\n\nYou are playing a game called LockSmith.\n\n# CONTROLS\n* RESET: start over\n* ACTION1: move up\n* ACTION2: move down\n* ACTION3: move left\n* ACTION4: move right\n* ACTION5/ACTION6: no-ops\n\n# ORIENTATION (read carefully)\n* The global frame is fixed: the bottom-left KEY INDICATOR is always at the bottom-left; the EXIT/lock is elsewhere.\n* ACTION1 (UP) moves you toward the area where 15s (move counters) are located; use this as a compass for “up.”\n* ACTION4 (RIGHT) increases your distance from the bottom-left key indicator; ACTION3 (LEFT) decreases it.\n* Legality checks with 4s (walls):\n  - RIGHT is ILLEGAL if any 4s lie immediately to the right (“after” in row order) of any 12/9 cells of your 8×8 player.\n  - LEFT is ILLEGAL if any 4s lie immediately to the left (“before” in row order) of any 12/9 cells of your 8×8 player.\n  - UP is ILLEGAL if any 4s lie directly above the topmost 12 row of your player.\n  - DOWN is ILLEGAL if any 4s lie directly below the bottommost 9 row of your player.\n* Always orient carefully before moving: check where the 15s lie (for UP), how far you are from the bottom-left indicator (for LEFT/RIGHT), and whether 4s precede/follow your 12s/9s in the intended direction.\n\n# GOAL\nFind/generate a key that MATCHES the key pattern shown at the EXIT, then navigate to the EXIT to finish the level.\nThere are 6 levels total. Complete all levels to WIN.\n\n# TILE MEANINGS (important ones)\n* 0 = white cell (used in key patterns)\n* 3 = walkable path / corridor marker (often outlines routes to key/exit)\n* 4 = WALL (solid). You cannot enter 4s.\n* 5 = EXIT indicator (presence of 5s marks/frames the exit area)\n* 8 = LIFE token (count lives as the number of 2×2 blocks of 8s)\n* 9 = blue cells (used in player lower body; also appear elsewhere in the map and in key logic)\n* 12 = orange cells (used in player upper body)\n* 15 = MOVE counter (number of 15s ≈ moves/energy left)\n\n# PLAYER (sprite + movement legality)\n* The player is an 8×8 sprite made ONLY of 12s (top two rows) over 9s (bottom six rows).\n  - Concretely: rows 0–1 (relative to the sprite) are all 12s; rows 2–7 are all 9s.\n  - Other scattered 9s on the board are NOT the player—only the exact 8×8 (2×8 of 12s stacked on 6×8 of 9s) is the player.\n* Movement rules:\n  - You may move only through non-4 cells (i.e., never overlap a 4 after a move).\n  - If any part of your 8×8 sprite would overlap a 4 in the target direction (including cases where 4s lie “under” 9s), that move is ILLEGAL.\n  - If your sprite is already touching 4s on a side, you cannot move further in that touching direction until you have clearance.\n  - Practically: navigate corridors “between the 4s”.\n\n# KEYS, EXIT, AND HOW TO FIND THEM\n* Bottom-left KEY INDICATOR (non-interactive):\n  - A small block of 0s and 9s COMPLETELY BOXED by 4s in the bottom-left of the entire grid.\n  - This is NOT reachable and NOT a gameplay area. It only shows your CURRENT selected key.\n* EXIT (the lock to open):\n  - Elsewhere on the map, the lock is the target 0/9 pattern you must match, adjacent to some 5s (the 5s need not fully surround it).\n  - You may leave the level only when your current key EXACTLY matches this lock’s 0/9 distribution.\n* KEY GENERATOR (interactive, how to generate keys):\n  - Look for a patch consisting of 0s and 9s that has a CLEAR path of 3s leading to it and around it, and is NOT bordered by 5s or boxed by 4s.\n  - When any part of your 8×8 player steps ONTO this patch, it GENERATES a NEW candidate key and updates the bottom-left indicator.\n  - Step OFF the patch and then back ON to generate yet another candidate key; repeat to cycle through the set of keys.\n  - Continue cycling until the bottom-left indicator EXACTLY matches the lock pattern at the exit (the same 0/9 layout adjacent to 5s).\n* Locating things quickly:\n  - Generator: 0/9 patch accessible via 3s, with only 3s around it (no 5s), is almost certainly the generator.\n  - Exit: a matching 0/9 pattern near 5s marks the lock/exit area.\n\n# HUD / PROGRESSION\n* Visual score on the second-to-last grid row (row 62): it contains several 4-cell “slots”.\n  - Slots made of 3s represent UNFINISHED levels.\n  - When a slot changes from 3s to another color, that level is COMPLETE.\n* Track remaining MOVES/ENERGY by counting tiles with value 15.\n* Track LIVES by counting distinct 2×2 blocks of 8s.\n\n# GENERAL NOTES\n* The grid is a bird’s-eye view.\n* If the grid does not change after an action, you likely attempted an illegal move into 4s.\n* Favor routes marked by 3s; use the generator (0/9 patch surrounded by 3s) to cycle keys; confirm the match by comparing the bottom-left indicator (boxed by 4s) to the 0/9 lock pattern found near 5s; then proceed to the exit.\n\n# EXAMPLE STRATEGY OBSERVATION\nThe 8×8 player (top rows 12s, bottom rows 9s) is touching 4s on the left, so LEFT is blocked. I see a 0/9 patch with only 3s around it to the right—that’s likely the generator. I should move RIGHT to step on/off it until the bottom-left indicator (boxed by 4s) matches the lock pattern I see near the 5s, then head to the exit.\n\n# TURN:\nCall exactly one action.\n\n"

    "content": "\n# CONTEXT:\nYou are an agent playing a dynamic game. Your objective is to\nWIN and avoid GAME_OVER while minimizing actions.\n\nOne action produces one Frame. One Frame is made of one or more sequential\nGrids. Each Grid is a matrix size INT<0,63> by INT<0,63> filled with\nINT<0,15> values. Each value represents a different color and usually implies a different object.\n\nYou are playing a game called LockSmith.\n\n# CONTROLS\n* RESET: start over\n* ACTION1: move up\n* ACTION2: move down\n* ACTION3: move left\n* ACTION4: move right\n* ACTION5/ACTION6: no-ops\n\n# ORIENTATION (read carefully)\n* The global frame is fixed: the bottom-left KEY INDICATOR is always at the bottom-left; the EXIT/lock is elsewhere.\n* ACTION1 (UP) moves you toward the area where 15s (move counters) are located; use this as a compass for “up.”\n* ACTION4 (RIGHT) increases your distance from the bottom-left key indicator; ACTION3 (LEFT) decreases it.\n* Legality checks with 4s (walls):\n  - RIGHT is ILLEGAL if any 4s lie immediately to the right (“after” in row order) of any 12/9 cells of your 8×8 player.\n  - LEFT is ILLEGAL if any 4s lie immediately to the left (“before” in row order) of any 12/9 cells of your 8×8 player.\n  - UP is ILLEGAL if any 4s lie directly above the topmost 12 row of your player.\n  - DOWN is ILLEGAL if any 4s lie directly below the bottommost 9 row of your player.\n* Always orient carefully before moving: check where the 15s lie (for UP), how far you are from the bottom-left indicator (for LEFT/RIGHT), and whether 4s precede/follow your 12s/9s in the intended direction.\n\n# GOAL\nFind/generate a key that MATCHES the key pattern shown at the EXIT, then navigate to the EXIT to finish the level.\nThere are 6 levels total. Complete all levels to WIN.\n\n# TILE MEANINGS (important ones)\n* 0 = white cell (used in key patterns)\n* 3 = walkable path / corridor marker (often outlines routes to key/exit)\n* 4 = WALL (solid). You cannot enter 4s.\n* 5 = EXIT indicator (presence of 5s marks/frames the exit area)\n* 8 = LIFE token (count lives as the number of 2×2 blocks of 8s)\n* 9 = blue cells (used in player lower body; also appear elsewhere in the map and in key logic)\n* 12 = orange cells (used in player upper body)\n* 15 = MOVE counter (number of 15s ≈ moves/energy left)\n\n# PLAYER (sprite + movement legality)\n* The player is an 8×8 sprite made ONLY of 12s (top two rows) over 9s (bottom six rows).\n  - Concretely: rows 0–1 (relative to the sprite) are all 12s; rows 2–7 are all 9s.\n  - Other scattered 9s on the board are NOT the player—only the exact 8×8 (2×8 of 12s stacked on 6×8 of 9s) is the player.\n* Movement rules:\n  - You may move only through non-4 cells (i.e., never overlap a 4 after a move).\n  - If any part of your 8×8 sprite would overlap a 4 in the target direction (including cases where 4s lie “under” 9s), that move is ILLEGAL.\n  - If your sprite is already touching 4s on a side, you cannot move further in that touching direction until you have clearance.\n  - Practically: navigate corridors “between the 4s”.\n\n# KEYS, EXIT, AND HOW TO FIND THEM\n* Bottom-left KEY INDICATOR (non-interactive):\n  - A small block of 0s and 9s COMPLETELY BOXED by 4s in the bottom-left of the entire grid.\n  - This is NOT reachable and NOT a gameplay area. It only shows your CURRENT selected key.\n* EXIT (the lock to open):\n  - Elsewhere on the map, the lock is the target 0/9 pattern you must match, adjacent to some 5s (the 5s need not fully surround it).\n  - You may leave the level only when your current key EXACTLY matches this lock’s 0/9 distribution.\n* KEY GENERATOR (interactive, how to generate keys):\n  - Look for a patch consisting of 0s and 9s that has a CLEAR path of 3s leading to it and around it, and is NOT bordered by 5s or boxed by 4s.\n  - When any part of your 8×8 player steps ONTO this patch, it GENERATES a NEW candidate key and updates the bottom-left indicator.\n  - Step OFF the patch and then back ON to generate yet another candidate key; repeat to cycle through the set of keys.\n  - Continue cycling until the bottom-left indicator EXACTLY matches the lock pattern at the exit (the same 0/9 layout adjacent to 5s).\n* Locating things quickly:\n  - Generator: 0/9 patch accessible via 3s, with only 3s around it (no 5s), is almost certainly the generator.\n  - Exit: a matching 0/9 pattern near 5s marks the lock/exit area.\n\n# HUD / PROGRESSION\n* Visual score on the second-to-last grid row (row 62): it contains several 4-cell “slots”.\n  - Slots made of 3s represent UNFINISHED levels.\n  - When a slot changes from 3s to another color, that level is COMPLETE.\n* Track remaining MOVES/ENERGY by counting tiles with value 15.\n* Track LIVES by counting distinct 2×2 blocks of 8s.\n\n# GENERAL NOTES\n* The grid is a bird’s-eye view.\n* If the grid does not change after an action, you likely attempted an illegal move into 4s.\n* Favor routes marked by 3s; use the generator (0/9 patch surrounded by 3s) to cycle keys; confirm the match by comparing the bottom-left indicator (boxed by 4s) to the 0/9 lock pattern found near 5s; then proceed to the exit.\n\n# EXAMPLE STRATEGY OBSERVATION\nThe 8×8 player (top rows 12s, bottom rows 9s) is touching 4s on the left, so LEFT is blocked. I see a 0/9 patch with only 3s around it to the right—that’s likely the generator. I should move RIGHT to step on/off it until the bottom-left indicator (boxed by 4s) matches the lock pattern I see near the 5s, then head to the exit.\n\n# TURN:\nCall exactly one action.\n\n"

    "content": "\n# CONTEXT:\nYou are an agent playing a dynamic game. Your objective is to\nWIN and avoid GAME_OVER while minimizing actions.\n\nOne action produces one Frame. One Frame is made of one or more sequential\nGrids. Each Grid is a matrix size INT<0,63> by INT<0,63> filled with\nINT<0,15> values. Each value represents a different color and usually implies a different object.\n\nYou are playing a game called LockSmith.\n\n# CONTROLS\n* RESET: start over\n* ACTION1: move up\n* ACTION2: move down\n* ACTION3: move left\n* ACTION4: move right\n* ACTION5/ACTION6: no-ops\n\n# ORIENTATION (read carefully)\n* The global frame is fixed: the bottom-left KEY INDICATOR is always at the bottom-left; the EXIT/lock is elsewhere.\n* ACTION1 (UP) moves you toward the area where 15s (move counters) are located; use this as a compass for “up.”\n* ACTION4 (RIGHT) increases your distance from the bottom-left key indicator; ACTION3 (LEFT) decreases it.\n* Legality checks with 4s (walls):\n  - RIGHT is ILLEGAL if any 4s lie immediately to the right (“after” in row order) of any 12/9 cells of your 8×8 player.\n  - LEFT is ILLEGAL if any 4s lie immediately to the left (“before” in row order) of any 12/9 cells of your 8×8 player.\n  - UP is ILLEGAL if any 4s lie directly above the topmost 12 row of your player.\n  - DOWN is ILLEGAL if any 4s lie directly below the bottommost 9 row of your player.\n* Always orient carefully before moving: check where the 15s lie (for UP), how far you are from the bottom-left indicator (for LEFT/RIGHT), and whether 4s precede/follow your 12s/9s in the intended direction.\n\n# GOAL\nFind/generate a key that MATCHES the key pattern shown at the EXIT, then navigate to the EXIT to finish the level.\nThere are 6 levels total. Complete all levels to WIN.\n\n# TILE MEANINGS (important ones)\n* 0 = white cell (used in key patterns)\n* 3 = walkable path / corridor marker (often outlines routes to key/exit)\n* 4 = WALL (solid). You cannot enter 4s.\n* 5 = EXIT indicator (presence of 5s marks/frames the exit area)\n* 8 = LIFE token (count lives as the number of 2×2 blocks of 8s)\n* 9 = blue cells (used in player lower body; also appear elsewhere in the map and in key logic)\n* 12 = orange cells (used in player upper body)\n* 15 = MOVE counter (number of 15s ≈ moves/energy left)\n\n# PLAYER (sprite + movement legality)\n* The player is an 8×8 sprite made ONLY of 12s (top two rows) over 9s (bottom six rows).\n  - Concretely: rows 0–1 (relative to the sprite) are all 12s; rows 2–7 are all 9s.\n  - Other scattered 9s on the board are NOT the player—only the exact 8×8 (2×8 of 12s stacked on 6×8 of 9s) is the player.\n* Movement rules:\n  - You may move only through non-4 cells (i.e., never overlap a 4 after a move).\n  - If any part of your 8×8 sprite would overlap a 4 in the target direction (including cases where 4s lie “under” 9s), that move is ILLEGAL.\n  - If your sprite is already touching 4s on a side, you cannot move further in that touching direction until you have clearance.\n  - Practically: navigate corridors “between the 4s”.\n\n# KEYS, EXIT, AND HOW TO FIND THEM\n* Bottom-left KEY INDICATOR (non-interactive):\n  - A small block of 0s and 9s COMPLETELY BOXED by 4s in the bottom-left of the entire grid.\n  - This is NOT reachable and NOT a gameplay area. It only shows your CURRENT selected key.\n* EXIT (the lock to open):\n  - Elsewhere on the map, the lock is the target 0/9 pattern you must match, adjacent to some 5s (the 5s need not fully surround it).\n  - You may leave the level only when your current key EXACTLY matches this lock’s 0/9 distribution.\n* KEY GENERATOR (interactive, how to generate keys):\n  - Look for a patch consisting of 0s and 9s that has a CLEAR path of 3s leading to it and around it, and is NOT bordered by 5s or boxed by 4s.\n  - When any part of your 8×8 player steps ONTO this patch, it GENERATES a NEW candidate key and updates the bottom-left indicator.\n  - Step OFF the patch and then back ON to generate yet another candidate key; repeat to cycle through the set of keys.\n  - Continue cycling until the bottom-left indicator EXACTLY matches the lock pattern at the exit (the same 0/9 layout adjacent to 5s).\n* Locating things quickly:\n  - Generator: 0/9 patch accessible via 3s, with only 3s around it (no 5s), is almost certainly the generator.\n  - Exit: a matching 0/9 pattern near 5s marks the lock/exit area.\n\n# HUD / PROGRESSION\n* Visual score on the second-to-last grid row (row 62): it contains several 4-cell “slots”.\n  - Slots made of 3s represent UNFINISHED levels.\n  - When a slot changes from 3s to another color, that level is COMPLETE.\n* Track remaining MOVES/ENERGY by counting tiles with value 15.\n* Track LIVES by counting distinct 2×2 blocks of 8s.\n\n# GENERAL NOTES\n* The grid is a bird’s-eye view.\n* If the grid does not change after an action, you likely attempted an illegal move into 4s.\n* Favor routes marked by 3s; use the generator (0/9 patch surrounded by 3s) to cycle keys; confirm the match by comparing the bottom-left indicator (boxed by 4s) to the 0/9 lock pattern found near 5s; then proceed to the exit.\n\n# EXAMPLE STRATEGY OBSERVATION\nThe 8×8 player (top rows 12s, bottom rows 9s) is touching 4s on the left, so LEFT is blocked. I see a 0/9 patch with only 3s around it to the right—that’s likely the generator. I should move RIGHT to step on/off it until the bottom-left indicator (boxed by 4s) matches the lock pattern I see near the 5s, then head to the exit.\n\n# TURN:\nCall exactly one action.\n\n"

    "content": "\n# CONTEXT:\nYou are an agent playing a dynamic game. Your objective is to\nWIN and avoid GAME_OVER while minimizing actions.\n\nOne action produces one Frame. One Frame is made of one or more sequential\nGrids. Each Grid is a matrix size INT<0,63> by INT<0,63> filled with\nINT<0,15> values. Each value represents a different color and usually implies a different object.\n\nYou are playing a game called LockSmith.\n\n# CONTROLS\n* RESET: start over\n* ACTION1: move up\n* ACTION2: move down\n* ACTION3: move left\n* ACTION4: move right\n* ACTION5/ACTION6: no-ops\n\n# ORIENTATION (read carefully)\n* The global frame is fixed: the bottom-left KEY INDICATOR is always at the bottom-left; the EXIT/lock is elsewhere.\n* ACTION1 (UP) moves you toward the area where 15s (move counters) are located; use this as a compass for “up.”\n* ACTION4 (RIGHT) increases your distance from the bottom-left key indicator; ACTION3 (LEFT) decreases it.\n* Legality checks with 4s (walls):\n  - RIGHT is ILLEGAL if any 4s lie immediately to the right (“after” in row order) of any 12/9 cells of your 8×8 player.\n  - LEFT is ILLEGAL if any 4s lie immediately to the left (“before” in row order) of any 12/9 cells of your 8×8 player.\n  - UP is ILLEGAL if any 4s lie directly above the topmost 12 row of your player.\n  - DOWN is ILLEGAL if any 4s lie directly below the bottommost 9 row of your player.\n* Always orient carefully before moving: check where the 15s lie (for UP), how far you are from the bottom-left indicator (for LEFT/RIGHT), and whether 4s precede/follow your 12s/9s in the intended direction.\n\n# GOAL\nFind/generate a key that MATCHES the key pattern shown at the EXIT, then navigate to the EXIT to finish the level.\nThere are 6 levels total. Complete all levels to WIN.\n\n# TILE MEANINGS (important ones)\n* 0 = white cell (used in key patterns)\n* 3 = walkable path / corridor marker (often outlines routes to key/exit)\n* 4 = WALL (solid). You cannot enter 4s.\n* 5 = EXIT indicator (presence of 5s marks/frames the exit area)\n* 8 = LIFE token (count lives as the number of 2×2 blocks of 8s)\n* 9 = blue cells (used in player lower body; also appear elsewhere in the map and in key logic)\n* 12 = orange cells (used in player upper body)\n* 15 = MOVE counter (number of 15s ≈ moves/energy left)\n\n# PLAYER (sprite + movement legality)\n* The player is an 8×8 sprite made ONLY of 12s (top two rows) over 9s (bottom six rows).\n  - Concretely: rows 0–1 (relative to the sprite) are all 12s; rows 2–7 are all 9s.\n  - Other scattered 9s on the board are NOT the player—only the exact 8×8 (2×8 of 12s stacked on 6×8 of 9s) is the player.\n* Movement rules:\n  - You may move only through non-4 cells (i.e., never overlap a 4 after a move).\n  - If any part of your 8×8 sprite would overlap a 4 in the target direction (including cases where 4s lie “under” 9s), that move is ILLEGAL.\n  - If your sprite is already touching 4s on a side, you cannot move further in that touching direction until you have clearance.\n  - Practically: navigate corridors “between the 4s”.\n\n# KEYS, EXIT, AND HOW TO FIND THEM\n* Bottom-left KEY INDICATOR (non-interactive):\n  - A small block of 0s and 9s COMPLETELY BOXED by 4s in the bottom-left of the entire grid.\n  - This is NOT reachable and NOT a gameplay area. It only shows your CURRENT selected key.\n* EXIT (the lock to open):\n  - Elsewhere on the map, the lock is the target 0/9 pattern you must match, adjacent to some 5s (the 5s need not fully surround it).\n  - You may leave the level only when your current key EXACTLY matches this lock’s 0/9 distribution.\n* KEY GENERATOR (interactive, how to generate keys):\n  - Look for a patch consisting of 0s and 9s that has a CLEAR path of 3s leading to it and around it, and is NOT bordered by 5s or boxed by 4s.\n  - When any part of your 8×8 player steps ONTO this patch, it GENERATES a NEW candidate key and updates the bottom-left indicator.\n  - Step OFF the patch and then back ON to generate yet another candidate key; repeat to cycle through the set of keys.\n  - Continue cycling until the bottom-left indicator EXACTLY matches the lock pattern at the exit (the same 0/9 layout adjacent to 5s).\n* Locating things quickly:\n  - Generator: 0/9 patch accessible via 3s, with only 3s around it (no 5s), is almost certainly the generator.\n  - Exit: a matching 0/9 pattern near 5s marks the lock/exit area.\n\n# HUD / PROGRESSION\n* Visual score on the second-to-last grid row (row 62): it contains several 4-cell “slots”.\n  - Slots made of 3s represent UNFINISHED levels.\n  - When a slot changes from 3s to another color, that level is COMPLETE.\n* Track remaining MOVES/ENERGY by counting tiles with value 15.\n* Track LIVES by counting distinct 2×2 blocks of 8s.\n\n# GENERAL NOTES\n* The grid is a bird’s-eye view.\n* If the grid does not change after an action, you likely attempted an illegal move into 4s.\n* Favor routes marked by 3s; use the generator (0/9 patch surrounded by 3s) to cycle keys; confirm the match by comparing the bottom-left indicator (boxed by 4s) to the 0/9 lock pattern found near 5s; then proceed to the exit.\n\n# EXAMPLE STRATEGY OBSERVATION\nThe 8×8 player (top rows 12s, bottom rows 9s) is touching 4s on the left, so LEFT is blocked. I see a 0/9 patch with only 3s around it to the right—that’s likely the generator. I should move RIGHT to step on/off it until the bottom-left indicator (boxed by 4s) matches the lock pattern I see near the 5s, then head to the exit.\n\n# TURN:\nCall exactly one action.\n\n"

    "content": "\n# CONTEXT:\nYou are an agent playing a dynamic game. Your objective is to\nWIN and avoid GAME_OVER while minimizing actions.\n\nOne action produces one Frame. One Frame is made of one or more sequential\nGrids. Each Grid is a matrix size INT<0,63> by INT<0,63> filled with\nINT<0,15> values. Each value represents a different color and usually implies a different object.\n\nYou are playing a game called LockSmith.\n\n# CONTROLS\n* RESET: start over\n* ACTION1: move up\n* ACTION2: move down\n* ACTION3: move left\n* ACTION4: move right\n* ACTION5/ACTION6: no-ops\n\n# ORIENTATION (read carefully)\n* The global frame is fixed: the bottom-left KEY INDICATOR is always at the bottom-left; the EXIT/lock is elsewhere.\n* ACTION1 (UP) moves you toward the area where 15s (move counters) are located; use this as a compass for “up.”\n* ACTION4 (RIGHT) increases your distance from the bottom-left key indicator; ACTION3 (LEFT) decreases it.\n* Legality checks with 4s (walls):\n  - RIGHT is ILLEGAL if any 4s lie immediately to the right (“after” in row order) of any 12/9 cells of your 8×8 player.\n  - LEFT is ILLEGAL if any 4s lie immediately to the left (“before” in row order) of any 12/9 cells of your 8×8 player.\n  - UP is ILLEGAL if any 4s lie directly above the topmost 12 row of your player.\n  - DOWN is ILLEGAL if any 4s lie directly below the bottommost 9 row of your player.\n* Always orient carefully before moving: check where the 15s lie (for UP), how far you are from the bottom-left indicator (for LEFT/RIGHT), and whether 4s precede/follow your 12s/9s in the intended direction.\n\n# GOAL\nFind/generate a key that MATCHES the key pattern shown at the EXIT, then navigate to the EXIT to finish the level.\nThere are 6 levels total. Complete all levels to WIN.\n\n# TILE MEANINGS (important ones)\n* 0 = white cell (used in key patterns)\n* 3 = walkable path / corridor marker (often outlines routes to key/exit)\n* 4 = WALL (solid). You cannot enter 4s.\n* 5 = EXIT indicator (presence of 5s marks/frames the exit area)\n* 8 = LIFE token (count lives as the number of 2×2 blocks of 8s)\n* 9 = blue cells (used in player lower body; also appear elsewhere in the map and in key logic)\n* 12 = orange cells (used in player upper body)\n* 15 = MOVE counter (number of 15s ≈ moves/energy left)\n\n# PLAYER (sprite + movement legality)\n* The player is an 8×8 sprite made ONLY of 12s (top two rows) over 9s (bottom six rows).\n  - Concretely: rows 0–1 (relative to the sprite) are all 12s; rows 2–7 are all 9s.\n  - Other scattered 9s on the board are NOT the player—only the exact 8×8 (2×8 of 12s stacked on 6×8 of 9s) is the player.\n* Movement rules:\n  - You may move only through non-4 cells (i.e., never overlap a 4 after a move).\n  - If any part of your 8×8 sprite would overlap a 4 in the target direction (including cases where 4s lie “under” 9s), that move is ILLEGAL.\n  - If your sprite is already touching 4s on a side, you cannot move further in that touching direction until you have clearance.\n  - Practically: navigate corridors “between the 4s”.\n\n# KEYS, EXIT, AND HOW TO FIND THEM\n* Bottom-left KEY INDICATOR (non-interactive):\n  - A small block of 0s and 9s COMPLETELY BOXED by 4s in the bottom-left of the entire grid.\n  - This is NOT reachable and NOT a gameplay area. It only shows your CURRENT selected key.\n* EXIT (the lock to open):\n  - Elsewhere on the map, the lock is the target 0/9 pattern you must match, adjacent to some 5s (the 5s need not fully surround it).\n  - You may leave the level only when your current key EXACTLY matches this lock’s 0/9 distribution.\n* KEY GENERATOR (interactive, how to generate keys):\n  - Look for a patch consisting of 0s and 9s that has a CLEAR path of 3s leading to it and around it, and is NOT bordered by 5s or boxed by 4s.\n  - When any part of your 8×8 player steps ONTO this patch, it GENERATES a NEW candidate key and updates the bottom-left indicator.\n  - Step OFF the patch and then back ON to generate yet another candidate key; repeat to cycle through the set of keys.\n  - Continue cycling until the bottom-left indicator EXACTLY matches the lock pattern at the exit (the same 0/9 layout adjacent to 5s).\n* Locating things quickly:\n  - Generator: 0/9 patch accessible via 3s, with only 3s around it (no 5s), is almost certainly the generator.\n  - Exit: a matching 0/9 pattern near 5s marks the lock/exit area.\n\n# HUD / PROGRESSION\n* Visual score on the second-to-last grid row (row 62): it contains several 4-cell “slots”.\n  - Slots made of 3s represent UNFINISHED levels.\n  - When a slot changes from 3s to another color, that level is COMPLETE.\n* Track remaining MOVES/ENERGY by counting tiles with value 15.\n* Track LIVES by counting distinct 2×2 blocks of 8s.\n\n# GENERAL NOTES\n* The grid is a bird’s-eye view.\n* If the grid does not change after an action, you likely attempted an illegal move into 4s.\n* Favor routes marked by 3s; use the generator (0/9 patch surrounded by 3s) to cycle keys; confirm the match by comparing the bottom-left indicator (boxed by 4s) to the 0/9 lock pattern found near 5s; then proceed to the exit.\n\n# EXAMPLE STRATEGY OBSERVATION\nThe 8×8 player (top rows 12s, bottom rows 9s) is touching 4s on the left, so LEFT is blocked. I see a 0/9 patch with only 3s around it to the right—that’s likely the generator. I should move RIGHT to step on/off it until the bottom-left indicator (boxed by 4s) matches the lock pattern I see near the 5s, then head to the exit.\n\n# TURN:\nCall exactly one action.\n\n"
