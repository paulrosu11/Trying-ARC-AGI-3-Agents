One Frame is made of one or more sequential\nGrids. Each Grid is a matrix size INT<0,63> by INT<0,63> filled with\nINT<0,15> values. Each value represents a different color and usually implies a different object.\n\nYou are playing a game called LockSmith.\n\n# CONTROLS\n* RESET: start over\n* ACTION1: move up\n* ACTION2: move down\n* ACTION3: move left\n* ACTION4: move right\n* ACTION5/ACTION6: no-ops **never do these as they do nothing!**\n\n# ORIENTATION (read carefully)\n* The global frame is fixed: the bottom-left KEY INDICATOR is always at the bottom-left; the EXIT/lock is elsewhere.\n* ACTION1 (UP) moves you toward the area where 15s (move counters) are located; use this as a compass for “up.”\n* ACTION4 (RIGHT) increases your distance from the bottom-left key indicator; ACTION3 (LEFT) decreases it.\n* Legality checks with 4s (walls):\n  - RIGHT is ILLEGAL if any 4s lie immediately to the right (“after” in row order) of any 12/9 cells of your 8×8 player.\n  - LEFT is ILLEGAL if any 4s lie immediately to the left (“before” in row order) of any 12/9 cells of your 8×8 player.\n  - UP is ILLEGAL if any 4s lie directly above the topmost 12 row of your player.\n  - DOWN is ILLEGAL if any 4s lie directly below the bottommost 9 row of your player.\n* Always orient carefully before moving: check where the 15s lie (for UP), how far you are from the bottom-left indicator (for LEFT/RIGHT), and whether 4s precede/follow your 12s/9s in the intended direction.\n\n# GOAL\nFind/generate a key that MATCHES the key pattern shown at the EXIT, then navigate to the EXIT to finish the level.\nThere are 6 levels total. Complete all levels to WIN.\n\n# TILE MEANINGS (important ones)\n* 0 = white cell (used in key patterns)\n* 3 = walkable path / corridor marker (often outlines routes to key/exit)\n* 4 = WALL (solid). You cannot enter 4s.\n* 5 = EXIT indicator (presence of 5s marks/frames the exit area)!!! **avoid this area and anything which touches it till the end**\n* 8 = LIFE token (count lives as the number of 2×2 blocks of 8s)\n* 9 = blue cells (used in player lower body; also appear elsewhere in the map and in key logic)\n* 12 = orange cells (used in player upper body)\n* 15 = MOVE counter (number of 15s ≈ moves/energy left)\n\n# PLAYER (sprite + movement legality)\n* The player is an 8×8 sprite made ONLY of 12s (top two rows) over 9s (bottom six rows).\n  - Concretely: rows 0–1 (relative to the sprite) are all 12s; rows 2–7 are all 9s.\n  - Other scattered 9s on the board are NOT the player—only the exact 8×8 (2×8 of 12s stacked on 6×8 of 9s) is the player.\n* Movement rules:\n  - You may move only through non-4 cells (i.e., never overlap a 4 after a move).\n  - If any part of your 8×8 sprite would overlap a 4 in the target direction (including cases where 4s lie “under” 9s), that move is ILLEGAL.\n  - If your sprite is already touching 4s on a side, you cannot move further in that touching direction until you have clearance.\n  - Practically: navigate corridors “between the 4s”.\n\n# KEYS, EXIT, AND HOW TO FIND THEM\n* Bottom-left KEY INDICATOR (non-interactive):\n  - A small block of 0s and 9s COMPLETELY BOXED by 4s in the bottom-left of the entire grid.\n  - This is NOT reachable and NOT a gameplay area. It only shows your CURRENT selected key.\n* EXIT (the lock to open):\n  - Elsewhere on the map, the lock is the target 0/9 pattern you must match, adjacent to some 5s (the 5s need not fully surround it).\n  - You may leave the level only when your current key EXACTLY matches this lock’s 0/9 distribution.\n* KEY GENERATOR (interactive, how to generate keys):\n  - Look for a patch consisting of 0s and 9s that has a CLEAR path of 3s leading to it and around it, and is NOT bordered by 5s or boxed by 4s.\n  - When any part of your 8×8 player steps ONTO this patch, it GENERATES a NEW candidate key and updates the bottom-left indicator.\n  - Step OFF the patch and then back ON to generate yet another candidate key; repeat to cycle through the set of keys.\n  - Continue cycling until the bottom-left indicator EXACTLY matches the lock pattern at the exit (the same 0/9 layout adjacent to 5s).\n* Locating things quickly:\n  - Generator: 0/9 patch accessible via 3s, with only 3s around it (no 5s), is almost certainly the generator.\n  - Exit: a matching 0/9 pattern near 5s marks the lock/exit area.\n\n# HUD / PROGRESSION\n* Visual score on the second-to-last grid row (row 62): it contains several 4-cell “slots”.\n  - Slots made of 3s represent UNFINISHED levels.\n  - When a slot changes from 3s to another color, that level is COMPLETE.\n* Track remaining MOVES/ENERGY by counting tiles with value 15.\n* Track LIVES by counting distinct 2×2 blocks of 8s.\n\n# GENERAL NOTES\n* The grid is a bird’s-eye view.\n* If the grid does not change after an action, you likely attempted an illegal move into 4s.\n* Favor routes marked by 3s; use the generator (0/9 patch surrounded by 3s) to cycle keys; confirm the match by comparing the bottom-left indicator (boxed by 4s) to the 0/9 lock pattern found near 5s; then proceed to the exit.\n\n# EXAMPLE STRATEGY OBSERVATION\nThe 8×8 player (top rows 12s, bottom rows 9s) is touching 4s on the left, so LEFT is blocked.

    "content": "\n# CONTEXT:\nYou are an agent playing a dynamic game. Your objective is to\nWIN and avoid GAME_OVER while minimizing actions.\n\nOne action produces one Frame. One Frame is made of one or more sequential\nGrids. Each Grid is a matrix size INT<0,63> by INT<0,63> filled with\nINT<0,15> values. Each value represents a different color and usually implies a different object.\n\nYou are playing a game called LockSmith.\n\n# CONTROLS\n* RESET: start over\n* ACTION1: move up\n* ACTION2: move down\n* ACTION3: move left\n* ACTION4: move right\n* ACTION5/ACTION6: no-ops **never do these as they do nothing!**\n\n# ORIENTATION (read carefully)\n* The global frame is fixed: the bottom-left KEY INDICATOR is always at the bottom-left; the EXIT/lock is elsewhere.\n* ACTION1 (UP) moves you toward the area where 15s (move counters) are located; use this as a compass for “up.”\n* ACTION4 (RIGHT) increases your distance from the bottom-left key indicator; ACTION3 (LEFT) decreases it.\n* Legality checks with 4s (walls):\n  - RIGHT is ILLEGAL if any 4s lie immediately to the right (“after” in row order) of any 12/9 cells of your 8×8 player.\n  - LEFT is ILLEGAL if any 4s lie immediately to the left (“before” in row order) of any 12/9 cells of your 8×8 player.\n  - UP is ILLEGAL if any 4s lie directly above the topmost 12 row of your player.\n  - DOWN is ILLEGAL if any 4s lie directly below the bottommost 9 row of your player.\n* Always orient carefully before moving: check where the 15s lie (for UP), how far you are from the bottom-left indicator (for LEFT/RIGHT), and whether 4s precede/follow your 12s/9s in the intended direction.\n\n# GOAL\nFind/generate a key that MATCHES the key pattern shown at the EXIT, then navigate to the EXIT to finish the level.\nThere are 6 levels total. Complete all levels to WIN.\n\n# TILE MEANINGS (important ones)\n* 0 = white cell (used in key patterns)\n* 3 = walkable path / corridor marker (often outlines routes to key/exit)\n* 4 = WALL (solid). You cannot enter 4s.\n* 5 = EXIT indicator (presence of 5s marks/frames the exit area)!!! **avoid this area and anything which touches it till the end**\n* 8 = LIFE token (count lives as the number of 2×2 blocks of 8s)\n* 9 = blue cells (used in player lower body; also appear elsewhere in the map and in key logic)\n* 12 = orange cells (used in player upper body)\n* 15 = MOVE counter (number of 15s ≈ moves/energy left)\n\n# PLAYER (sprite + movement legality)\n* The player is an 8×8 sprite made ONLY of 12s (top two rows) over 9s (bottom six rows).\n  - Concretely: rows 0–1 (relative to the sprite) are all 12s; rows 2–7 are all 9s.\n  - Other scattered 9s on the board are NOT the player—only the exact 8×8 (2×8 of 12s stacked on 6×8 of 9s) is the player.\n* Movement rules:\n  - You may move only through non-4 cells (i.e., never overlap a 4 after a move).\n  - If any part of your 8×8 sprite would overlap a 4 in the target direction (including cases where 4s lie “under” 9s), that move is ILLEGAL.\n  - If your sprite is already touching 4s on a side, you cannot move further in that touching direction until you have clearance.\n  - Practically: navigate corridors “between the 4s”.\n\n# KEYS, EXIT, AND HOW TO FIND THEM\n* Bottom-left KEY INDICATOR (non-interactive):\n  - A small block of 0s and 9s COMPLETELY BOXED by 4s in the bottom-left of the entire grid.\n  - This is NOT reachable and NOT a gameplay area. It only shows your CURRENT selected key.\n* EXIT (the lock to open):\n  - Elsewhere on the map, the lock is the target 0/9 pattern you must match, adjacent to some 5s (the 5s need not fully surround it).\n  - You may leave the level only when your current key EXACTLY matches this lock’s 0/9 distribution.\n* KEY GENERATOR (interactive, how to generate keys):\n  - Look for a patch consisting of 0s and 9s that has a CLEAR path of 3s leading to it and around it, and is NOT bordered by 5s or boxed by 4s.\n  - When any part of your 8×8 player steps ONTO this patch, it GENERATES a NEW candidate key and updates the bottom-left indicator.\n  - Step OFF the patch and then back ON to generate yet another candidate key; repeat to cycle through the set of keys.\n  - Continue cycling until the bottom-left indicator EXACTLY matches the lock pattern at the exit (the same 0/9 layout adjacent to 5s).\n* Locating things quickly:\n  - Generator: 0/9 patch accessible via 3s, with only 3s around it (no 5s), is almost certainly the generator.\n  - Exit: a matching 0/9 pattern near 5s marks the lock/exit area.\n\n# HUD / PROGRESSION\n* Visual score on the second-to-last grid row (row 62): it contains several 4-cell “slots”.\n  - Slots made of 3s represent UNFINISHED levels.\n  - When a slot changes from 3s to another color, that level is COMPLETE.\n* Track remaining MOVES/ENERGY by counting tiles with value 15.\n* Track LIVES by counting distinct 2×2 blocks of 8s.\n\n# GENERAL NOTES\n* The grid is a bird’s-eye view.\n* If the grid does not change after an action, you likely attempted an illegal move into 4s.\n* Favor routes marked by 3s; use the generator (0/9 patch surrounded by 3s) to cycle keys; confirm the match by comparing the bottom-left indicator (boxed by 4s) to the 0/9 lock pattern found near 5s; then proceed to the exit.\n\n# EXAMPLE STRATEGY OBSERVATION\nThe 8×8 player (top rows 12s, bottom rows 9s) is touching 4s on the left, so LEFT is blocked. I see a 0/9 patch with only 3s around it to the right—that’s likely the generator. I should move RIGHT to step on/off it until the bottom-left indicator (boxed by 4s) matches the lock pattern I see near the 5s, then head to the exit.\n**again if the key indicator EVER matches the exit, head DIRECTLY to the exit avoiding the key generator. COMPARE THE KEY INDICATOR AND THE EXIT EVERYTIME FIRST THING**\n**Be smart and understand the positioning of the grids and where the 4s are**\n\n\n**AGAIN ALWAYS ALWAYS FIRST BEFORE ALL ELSE CHECK IF THE WIN CONDITION OF THE MATCHING KEYS IS SATISFIED FIRST. DON'T UNDERESTIMATE THIS, FREQUENTLY THE DISTRIBUTIONS OF THE 0S AND 9S DO MATCH SO BE SMART**\n# TURN:\nCall exactly one action.\n\n"

The 8×8 player (two orange rows over six blue rows) is in the lower-right quadrant, just above a larger blue patch, with open light-gray path around and no dark-gray walls immediately above. I see a small white/blue patch surrounded by light-gray paths slightly above-left of the player—that’s likely the key generator. The exit/lock is the white/blue patch embedded next to/inside the black region higher up. Given no walls block upward movement and the purple 15s (move counters) lie toward the top, the best legal move is to go up toward the generator.\n\nACTION1"
