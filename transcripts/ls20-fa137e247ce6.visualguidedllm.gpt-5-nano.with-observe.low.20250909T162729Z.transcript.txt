Surrounding walls are dark gray and form immediate barriers around the player, with light gray tiles indicating walkable paths that weave away from the nearby walls. A key generator is visible as a white/blue patch embedded within the light gray paths, representing the active mechanism needed to produce a key. The exit/lock is depicted as a white/blue pattern near a black-framed boundary and is situated farther away in a different region of the map, suggesting the need to generate the key and then navigate toward the exit. A bottom-left indicator pattern exists that typically aligns with the exit pattern, but in this snapshot it does not yet clearly match, reinforcing the need to first interact with the generator to produce the key before attempting to finalize the exit match. Given this setup, the safest and most direct next step is to move RIGHT to approach the generator, maintaining access to a clear path toward the exit after key generation while avoiding the surrounding walls."

The key generator is visible as a white/blue patch embedded in the path, indicating the spot where a key will be produced. The bottom-left key indicator (a white/blue motif boxed by dark gray) should be compared to the exit lock, which is a white/blue pattern near a black framing; success depends on producing the key that exactly matches the lock’s pattern to unlock the exit. The exit itself sits adjacent to black framing, suggesting it remains inaccessible until the proper key is generated and the lock is opened. Given the current layout, the most prudent immediate action is to move toward the key generator to obtain the key while avoiding walls. The path to the right appears open in the snapshot, so advancing right should bring you closer to the generator; if the right path is blocked by a wall, an alternative route upward or downward should be taken to reach the generator and then return toward the exit with the correct key. Recommend moving right (ACTION4) as the next step, provided the tile ahead is not a dark-gray wall. If blocked, pivot to an unobstructed direction (up or down) to reorient toward the generator."

A key generator is visible as a white/blue patch embedded within the light-gray path, suggesting the immediate objective is to move toward this generator to produce the required key. Since the exit is blocked by the black framing and requires the key (matching the lock pattern), the optimal plan is to prioritize reaching and activating the generator while avoiding walls, then returning toward the exit with the generated key. Given typical maze layouts, a direct move toward the right if the tile is not a wall would be a sensible first step, as it often aligns with common generator locations.\n\nRecommended action: ACTION4 (right), provided the tile ahead is not a dark-gray wall.

Surrounding it are dark-gray walls that constrain movement, with the immediate surroundings indicating limited options for movement without colliding with walls. The key generator shows up as a white-on-blue patch embedded within the light-gray terrain, marking a primary objective to generate the key before attempting to reach the exit. The exit lock is described as a white/blue pattern adjacent to a black-framed area, meaning the exit becomes usable only after the key is produced. The bottom-left indicator pattern suggests a relation to the key/exit pairing, reinforcing the need to first generate the key and then move toward the exit. Given the current proximity to the generator and the necessity to create the key before heading to the exit, a safe and strategic next step is to move right (ACTION4). This keeps us on a clear, light-gray path toward the key generator while avoiding immediate dark-gray walls and preserving options for the subsequent step to interact with the key and then advance toward the exit. \n\nAction: ACTION4 (right)"

    "content": "From the provided frame description, the player remains as an orange tile layered over a blue base, occupying the standard orange-over-blue 8×8 sprite, positioned on a light-gray path with surrounding dark-gray walls that constrain immediate movement. The key generator appears as a white-on-blue patch embedded within the light-gray terrain, signaling the objective to generate a key before proceeding to the exit. The exit/lock is described as a white/blue pattern adjacent to a black framing, indicating that the exit becomes accessible only after the key is generated. The bottom-left indicator pattern (white/blue) continues to serve as a cue for the relation between the key and exit, reinforcing the strategy of first generating the key then advancing toward the exit. Given the current layout, the most prudent next step is to move right (ACTION4) to align with the clear path toward the key generator while avoiding walls, preserving the route options for obtaining the key and subsequently approaching the exit. This choice keeps us on a legal, unblocked trajectory toward the generator and minimizes unnecessary backtracking.\n\nAction: ACTION4 (right)"

Based on the standard LockSmith layout, the bottom-left key indicator should be compared to the exit lock to judge the current objective: generate a key that matches the lock pattern, then navigate through light-gray paths while avoiding dark-gray walls toward the exit framed by black. The player typically appears as orange-tinted on top of a blue tile, with walls as dark gray blocks, paths as light gray corridors, and the key generator as a white/blue patch contrasted against light gray. The exit is approached once the key matches the lock’s white/blue pattern.\n\nRecommended directional intent: If the white/blue key generator is visibly reachable to the right through light-gray tiles without crossing any dark-gray walls, move RIGHT (ACTION4) to approach and collect or observe the generator and its pattern. If the right path is blocked, consider a vertical detour—UP (ACTION1) or DOWN (ACTION2)—to bypass the obstruction and approach the generator from a different angle. After locating a generator that matches the lock (or once the correct pattern is identified), pivot toward the exit by tracing a safe corridor that avoids walls, aiming to reach the black-framed exit. If you cannot determine a safe path from the current frame, prioritize moving toward the nearest observable generator patch while avoiding walls, then re-evaluate for the exit once the key is confirmed."

In LockSmith, the key must exactly match the lock’s white/blue pattern, and once generated you must navigate through light-gray paths while avoiding dark-gray walls to reach the exit (the black-framed area). The goal is to first locate the generator and confirm its white/blue pattern, then align and move toward the exit once the pattern matches. The bottom-left key indicator and the exit lock patterns serve as guides to align your approach, ensuring you don’t collide with walls en route.\n\nRecommended directional intent: If you can confirm a clear, unobstructed path toward a white/blue key generator located to the right across light-gray tiles, choose RIGHT (ACTION4). If the rightward route is blocked by dark-gray walls, try a vertical detour (UP ACTION1 or DOWN ACTION2) to bypass the obstruction and approach the generator from another angle, then pivot toward the exit once the key appears. If you can’t determine a safe path, a cautious default is to move toward whichever direction leads toward the nearest white/blue key patch while avoiding walls, prioritizing the generator first, then the exit."

The key generator is identifiable as a white/blue patch embedded within light gray corridors, while the exit is framed in black with a white/blue lock pattern nearby. The bottom-left region (where the key indicator would sit) is not visible in this crop, so I cannot confirm the exact key-match state yet.\n\nThe immediate vicinity shows an open light-gray path to the right of the player with no immediate dark-gray obstacles directly adjacent in that direction, suggesting a safe move to the right (ACTION4). This would keep progress toward the generator or potential exit without colliding with walls. If the path to the right is blocked by an unseen wall just off-screen, the next best safe route would be downward or upward along the visible corridor, but based on the current frame, moving right seems the most straightforward first step. Therefore, the recommended directional intent is to move RIGHT."
